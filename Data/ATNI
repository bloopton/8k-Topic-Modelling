Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant. --------------------------------------------- On July 22, 2002, the Board of Directors of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company"), upon recommendation of its Audit Committee, decided not to engage Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen") as the Company's principal public accountants and reengaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the Company's principal public accountants for fiscal year 2002. Andersen's reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and the subsequent interim period through July 22, 2002, there were no disagreements between the Company and Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their reports; and there were no reportable events as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Company provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Andersen has informed the Company that it is unable to provide a letter stating whether it is in agreement with such statements. During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and the subsequent interim period through July 22, 2002, the Company did not consult PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP with respect to the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's consolidated financial statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (April 30, 2003) , today reported earnings of $2.8 million, or $0.56 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. For the quarter ended March 31, 2002, the Company earned $2.0 million, or $0.40 per share. First quarter earnings for 2003 represent a 40% increase over last year's first quarter.
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX: ANK)
 
Telephone operating revenues were $18.1 million as compared to $15.3 million for the first quarter of 2002, an increase of $2.8 million, or 18%. The increase in telephone operating revenue is principally attributable to a 31% increase in local exchange revenue and an 8% increase in international long distance revenue, or $1.9 million and $0.7 million respectively. The increase in local exchange revenue reflects substantial additions of both wireline and cellular subscribers from the prior period. The increase in international long distance revenue was due to an increased volume of traffic following the mandated reduction in international settlement rates for traffic between Guyana and the United States effective January 1, 2002. Cellular subscribers increased from 51,244 on March 31, 2002 to 92,756 on March 31, 2003, an increase of 81%, while wireline subscribers increased from 81,386 to 87,057, reflecting total additions of 5,671, or 7% from the prior period.
 
Total telephone operating expenses were $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2003 compared with $10.2 million for the corresponding quarter of 2002, an increase of 8% or $0.8 million. A reduction of international long distance expense due to the full implementation of the FCC mandated reduction in international settlement rates was offset by higher depreciation, power, legal and other expenses related to the expansion of facilities.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. said, "We were pleased to read in the Guyana press on March 21, 2003 of President Jagdeo's direction to the Prime Minister, Sam Hines, to reconvene the Government's negotiating team with respect to talks with ATN and GT&T representatives begun in Trinidad last April concerning new telecommunications policy initiatives of the Government of Guyana. In view of this positive development, we have decided not to appeal the recent decision of the U.S. District Court in Washington,
 
D.C. which held, among other things, that ATN had no private right of action to challenge a proposed loan to Guyana by the IADB which we believed would have infringed our contractual rights."
 
"Our Guyana subsidiary, GT&T, continues to grow strongly, reflecting additional investment last year of $14.5 million and enabling us to expand both our cellular operations and our fixed wireline customers substantially. Teledensity in Guyana (phone lines per total population) is now over 20%, compared to less than 2% when we began operation there in 1991. Cellular operations in Bermuda also prospered, with our share of BDC's net income up 55% from the first quarter of 2002, up 200% or three times the first quarter of 2001, and now contributing almost 20% of ATN's net income."
 
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. is a telecommunications company with headquarters in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Its principal subsidiary, Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company, Limited, is 80% owned by ATN and is the national telephone service provider in the Cooperative Republic of Guyana for all local, long-distance and international service. ATN owns 100% of Choice Communications, LLC, the largest internet service provider in the United States Virgin Islands and the only wireless TV provider in the USVI, as well as 100% of Atlantic Tele-Center, Inc., a Web-enabled outsourcing call center in Guyana. ATN also holds a 44% investment in Bermuda Digital Communications Ltd., the non-wireline cellular operator in Bermuda using the name "Cellular One".
 
This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Actual results could differ materially from these statements as a result of many factors, including matters discussed in the Company's Form 10K annual report for the year ended December 31, 2002, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (July 29, 2003) today reported earnings of $3.1 million, or $0.62 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, compared to earnings of $2.2 million, or $0.43 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2002, an increase of 43%. The Company's second quarter earnings also were 10% higher than first quarter 2003 earnings of $2.8 million, or $0.56 per share. Earnings for the first six months of this year total $5.9 million, or $1.18 per share ($1.17 diluted), compared to earnings of $4.2 million, or $0.84 per share ($0.83 diluted) for the six months ended June 30, 2002, an increase of 41%.
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX: ANK)
 
Telephone operating revenues were $19.1 million in the second quarter, compared to $16.5 million for the second quarter of 2002, an increase of 16%. The increase in telephone operating revenues is principally attributable to a 26% increase in local exchange revenues and a 9% increase in international long distance revenues, or $1.7 million and $0.9 million respectively. The increase in local exchange revenues primarily reflects the substantial increase in GT&T's cellular subscribers from the previous year, although GT&T's wireline subscribers (access lines) increased as well. Cellular subscribers rose from 57,048 on June 30, 2002 to 104,852 on June 30, 2003, an increase of 83%, while wireline subscribers increased from 82,043 to 88,138, or 7%. At the end of the first quarter of 2003, GT&T had cellular subscribers of 92,756 and wireline subscribers of 87,057.
 
The increase of $1.5 million in international long distance revenue in the first six months of this year compared to last year, about 9%, was due to an increased volume of traffic of about 27%. The increased traffic was due to the substantial increase in GT&T's subscribers, as well as lower prices for U.S. traffic continuing to stimulate demand in response to the FCC mandated reduction in international settlement rates for traffic between Guyana and the United States effective January 1, 2002. The lower prices for U.S. traffic also appear to have stimulated refiling through the U.S. of traffic for Guyana from foreign carriers which generally pay more to send such traffic to Guyana directly. These two factors have contributed to a reduction in average revenue per minute for inbound long distance.
Total telephone operating expenses were $11.1 million for the second quarter of 2003, compared with $10.4 million for the corresponding quarter of 2002, an increase of 6%, as telephone operating margins widened. The largest contribution to the improvement in margins was a reduction in international long distance expense, which was offset in part by higher general and administrative expense as well as higher depreciation and other expenses related to the substantial expansion of facilities and subscribers
.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. said "We are pleased by the continued growth of our Guyana subsidiary, GT&T, particularly in its cellular operations. Press reports in Guyana about the construction activity of one of the other cellular license holderswith whom GT&T has signed an interconnection agreementindicate that we may face more significant competition in the cellular business later this year. Cellular operations in Bermuda continued to thrive as well, with our share of net income up 15% from the second quarter of 2002 and up 32% from the first half of 2002. First and second quarter subscriber and revenue growth flattened, but our Cellular One company remains the largest cellular provider in Bermuda and we expect to see growth resume with the introduction of new handsets and services following the completion this month of its upgrade to a "2.5G" CDMA system."

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (October 29, 2003) today reported earnings of $3.1 million, or $0.62 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, compared to earnings of $2.7 million, or $0.55 per share ($0.54 diluted), for the quarter ended September 30, 2002, an increase of 14%. The Company's third quarter earnings were in line with second quarter 2003 earnings of $3.1 million, or $0.62 per share. Earnings for the first nine months of this year total $9.1 million, or $1.80 per share, compared to earnings of $6.9 million, or $1.39 per share ($1.37 diluted), for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, an increase of 31%.
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX: ANK)
 
Telephone operating revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 were $19.7 million, approximately equal to the third quarter of 2002. Telephone operating revenues for the third quarter of 2002 included a $1.5 million non-recurring settlement of amounts owed to GT&T by a large international carrier for prior periods. Excluding the effect of this settlement, telephone operating revenues grew 9% in the third quarter of 2003 and international long distance revenues posted a 5% increase on 15% higher international traffic volume. Continuing the trend of recent quarters, local exchange service revenues grew at a faster pace than international revenues, with a 15% or $1.1 million increase over the third quarter of 2002. The increase in local exchange service revenues primarily reflects a 59% increase in GT&T's cellular subscribers, which rose from 67,931 on September 30, 2002 to 107,807 on September 30, 2003. GT&T's wireline subscribers (access lines) increased by 7% from 83,791 to 89,693 during the comparable period.
 
Total telephone operating expenses decreased by 6% to $11.0 million for the third quarter of 2003, compared with $11.7 million for the corresponding quarter of 2002, despite the increase in subscribers and lines in service. The largest component of this reduction in expenses was a reduction in international long distance expenses of 28%. In addition, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2003 showed a 8% decline compared to the third quarter of 2002, although the 2002 results included a substantial non-recurring cost.
The Company's third quarter earnings also benefited from a 15% reduction in losses from other operations, primarily reflecting a 62% or $0.5 million increase in revenues of other operations as the Company's subsidiary, Choice Communications, saw a substantial increase in its cable television subscriber base over the prior period.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003 telephone operating revenues increased by 11% to $56.9 million, compared to $51.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002. Growth in telephone operating revenues was principally attributable to a 24% or $4.7 million increase in local exchange service revenues. The increase in local exchange revenues primarily reflects the growth in GT&T's cellular and wireline subscriber base.
 
Total telephone operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 increased by 2% to $33.0 million, compared with $32.3 million for the corresponding period of 2002. Higher telephone operating expenses and general and administrative expenses stemming from the overall growth of GT&T's business and subscriber base were offset by a 27% decline in international long distance expenses.
 
Cellular operations in Bermuda were up 8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. During the third quarter of 2003 our share of net income decreased by 22% from the third quarter of 2002, reflecting an extraordinary legal expense recorded in the current quarter.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said "We are happy to see continued strength in our results this year. Although growth in revenues slowed at our GT&T subsidiary, we continue to add both wireless and wireline subscribers and to cut costs in our international operations. We are also pleased to see a significant improvement in results of other operations, as the management team continues to work hard on building out the business of our Choice Communications subsidiary and focuses on controlling costs in all our businesses. Our Bermuda cellular company managed a modest increase to its leading market share and subscriber base, but experienced higher expense due to the delayed launch of high-capacity CDMA service in the quarter. We expect the results of this business to improve in coming quarters."

ST. THOMAS U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (March 12, 2004) Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK) today reported its operating results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2003. ATN reported net income of $3.2 million, or $0.64 per share ($0.64 diluted), for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, compared to net income of $2.6 million, or $0.51 per share ($0.50 diluted), for the quarter ended December 31, 2002, an increase of 25%. Net income for the full year totaled $12.2 million, or $2.44 per share ($2.43 diluted), compared to earnings of $9.5 million, or $1.90 per share ($1.87 diluted), for 2002, an increase of 29%.
 
For the full year 2003, telephone operating revenues rose 11% to $78.9 million, as compared to $70.8 million for 2002. Local exchange service revenues contributed nearly $6 million of this roughly $8 million increase, rising 21%. The increase in local exchange service revenues primarily reflects a 48% increase in GT&T's cellular subscribers, which increased from 79,915 on December 31, 2002 to 118,658 on December 31, 2003. For the same periods, GT&T's wireline subscribers (access lines) increased by 7% from 86,245 to 92,683 also contributing to the increase in revenues.
 
International long distance revenues rose 6% on greater traffic volumes but lower revenue per minute. Income from telephone operations increased to $34.5 million in 2003, as compared to $27.4 million in 2002, an increase of $7.1 million or 26%. The Company was able to improve margins significantly by holding total telephone operating expenses essentially flat, offsetting a 15% increase in general and administrative expenses and a 8% increase in telephone operating expenses with a 24% reduction in international long distance expenses due to lower average outbound termination rates.
 
Other operations, comprised of Choice Communications and Call Home Telecom in the United States Virgin Islands and Atlantic Tele-Center (ATC) in Guyana, continued to struggle in their development efforts, increasing revenues by 13%, but also increasing expenses resulting in a loss from other operations of $5.5 million, a 9% increase over 2002. Revenues and losses of other operations were adversely affected by write-downs of accounts receivable at Call Home Telecom.
 
Cellular operations in Bermuda were up 12% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, with equity in earnings of BDC rising to $2 million from $1.8 million in 2002. Both increases reflect subscriber growth, as well as careful attention to costs. BDC ended the year with nearly 17,800 subscribers, as compared to approximately 16,600 subscribers at the end of 2002.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "We are quite pleased with our overall results in 2003. Management of our GT&T subsidiary did an excellent job of keeping expenses in check while growing subscribers and lines. GT&T has publicly announced a goal of adding around 13,000 access lines in 2004, in continuation of
our commitment to extend the core telecommunications infrastructure to new communities in Guyana. GT&T has also begun work on adding a GSM overlay to its TDMA system to allow it to offer new services to its customers. While the fourth quarter saw a substantial increase in cellular subscribers due to seasonal promotions, we do not expect to see the same growth of our base in 2004 and we expect incoming competition, which had originally announced plans to be operational in 2003, to begin offering services some time in 2004. Choice Communications, our U.S. Virgin Islands subsidiary, continued strong growth in its wireless CATV business and we believe that the additional investments we are making to expand and improve the network will lead to improved operating performance in 2004."
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2003 telephone operating revenues were $21.9 million, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter of 2002. Both international long distance revenues and local exchange service revenues posted significant increases in the quarter, with local exchange service revenues rising by $1 million or 13% over the fourth quarter of 2002 due to the aforementioned strong cellular subscriber growth and, to a lesser extent, increased access lines in service.
 
International long distance revenues increased by $1.7 million or 16% over the fourth quarter of 2002. While total minutes of use increased by 34% during the quarter, reflecting both increased cellular subscribers and lines in service, the average revenue per minute was lower due to a continued shift in the mix of traffic and the overall decline in international rates. International long distance revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 includes $750,000 related to traffic generated in prior periods as GT&T received payment on settled disputes with two international carriers.
 
The Company recorded other income of $826,000 in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared to expenses of $65,000 in the fourth quarter of 2002. This increase is primarily the result of a substantial net foreign exchange gain in the quarter, but a more modest gain for the year, stemming from a decline in the US dollar value of the Guyanese dollar.
 
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. is a telecommunications company with headquarters in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Its principal subsidiary, Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company, Limited, is 80% owned by ATN and is the national telephone service provider in the Cooperative Republic of Guyana for all local, long-distance and international service. ATN also owns 44% of Bermuda Digital Communications Ltd., doing business in Bermuda as Cellular One, 100% of Choice Communications, LLC, the largest Internet service provider in the United States Virgin Islands and the only wireless TV provider in the USVI, as well as 100% of Atlantic Tele-Center, Inc., a Web-enabled outsourcing call center in Guyana.
 
This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (April 28, 2004) Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK) today reported earnings of $3.1 million, or $0.63 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, compared to earnings of $2.8 million, or $0.56 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, an increase of 12%. The Company's first quarter earnings were down slightly from its fourth quarter 2003 earnings of $3.2 million or $0.64 per share due to seasonal revenues earned in the fourth quarter of 2003.
 
Telephone operating revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 were $19.4, as compared to $18.1 million for the first quarter of 2003. The increase in telephone operating revenues is principally attributable to a $1.5 million or 16% increase in international long distance revenues, reflecting an increased volume of traffic at GT&T although lower revenue per minute. Local exchange service revenues were $7.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, a decrease of $231,000 or 3%. GT&T's cellular subscribers increased by 32% to 122,862 at March 31, 2004 and wireline subscribers (access lines) increased by 7% to 93,520. The increased lines and handsets in service led to the increase in international long distance traffic and revenues, but were not able to overcome the effect of a 14% decline in the value of the Guyana dollar on our local exchange service revenues, which is billed and paid in the local currency.
 
Income from telephone operations increased to $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2004, as compared to $7.4 million for the period ended March 31, 2003, an increase of $939,000 or 13%. Total telephone operating expenses increased by 3% to $11.1 million. The large increase in lines and cellular subscribers led to an 11% increase in telephone operating expenses, despite the decline in value of the Guyana dollar. This increased expense was partially offset by a 25% decline in international long distance expenses resulting from lower average outbound termination rates.
 
Other operations, comprised of Choice Communications and Call Home Telecom in the United States Virgin Islands and Atlantic Tele-Center (ATC) in Guyana, reported a loss of $1.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, an increase of $394,000 over the comparable period of 2003. The widening loss on other operations was primarily due to an increase in expenses at Choice, particularly increased sales expenses and depreciation expense, despite a 29% increase in revenues. Management was able to cut call center expenses at ATC compared to the comparable quarter last year, but the first quarter of 2004 also suffered by comparison due to a reduction in revenue at Call Home Telecom of approximately $250,000.
 
Equity in the earnings of Bermuda Digital Communications, our cellular operator in Bermuda, was $497,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2004, an 8% decline, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2003. The decrease in earnings primarily reflects increased operating costs
associated with the increase in subscribers. Cellular subscribers increased 6% from 16,608 at March 31, 2003 to 17,614 at March 31, 2004 but have declined by 1% since December 31, 2003 due to increased competition.
 
The Company recorded other income of $1.25 million in the first quarter of 2004, compared to a loss of $70,000 in the first quarter of 2003. This improvement is primarily the result of a foreign exchange loss of $291,000 recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2003 compared to a gain of $945,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2004. A decline in the value of the Guyana dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar decreased the value of GT&T's Guyana dollar denominated net liabilities, resulting in a gain.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: " Our GT&T subsidiary had another excellent quarter. International long distance traffic continued its robust growth thanks to the substantial increase in handsets and lines in service over the past twelve months. On the other hand, a decline in the value of the Guyana dollar against the US dollar limited the revenue growth for GT&T's local exchange operations (which include cellular). This currency movement also led to a surge in other income, a major factor in our increased earnings for the first quarter, an effect that may not continue in future quarters.
 
The results of other operations were not so favorable, despite continued subscriber growth at Choice Communications. We are continuing to focus significant management attention on improving results at these smaller units, but it may be some time before we see a substantial improvement in their results. Our Bermuda cellular operation continued to make an important contribution to earnings, although a particularly slow early first quarter and our first consecutive quarter decline in subscribers contributed to the decline in earnings from the first quarter of 2003 for this unit."

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (July 29, 2004) Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK) today reported that earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 were $3.4 million, or $0.67 per share, compared to earnings of $3.1 million, or $0.62 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, an increase of 9%. For the first six months of 2004 earnings totaled $6.5 million or $1.30 per share, compared to earnings of $5.9 million, or $1.18 per share ($1.17 diluted), for the six months ended June 30, 2003, an increase of 10%. The Company's second quarter 2004 earnings were also up nearly 8% from its first quarter 2004 earnings of $3.1 million or $0.63 per share, despite recording a significant foreign exchange gain during the first quarter of 2004.
 
Telephone operating revenues were $20.5 million in the second quarter, compared to $19.1 million for the second quarter of 2003, an increase of 7%. The increase in telephone operating revenues is principally attributable to a $1.1 million or 11% increase in international long distance revenues, reflecting an increased volume of traffic at GT&T although lower revenue per minute. Local exchange service revenues were $8.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 and were essentially in line with the comparable quarter of 2003. GT&T's cellular subscribers increased by 31% to 137,236 at June 30, 2004 and wireline subscribers (access lines) increased by 10% to 96,549. The increased lines and handsets in service contributed to the increase in international long distance traffic and revenues, but local exchange revenues, which are billed and paid in local currency, continue to be constrained by the reduced value of the Guyana dollar. Telephone operating revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased by 7% over the comparable period of 2003 to $39.9 million paced by a 13% increase in international long distance revenues.
 
Income from telephone operations increased to $10.3 million in the second quarter of 2004, as compared to $8.5 million for the period ended June 30, 2003, an increase of $1.7 million or 21%. Total telephone operating expenses decreased by 3% to $10.2 million. The decrease in total telephone operating expenses was primarily due to a $680,000, or 35%, decline in international long distance expenses resulting from lower average outbound termination rates. This was partially offset by a $554,000, or 8%, increase in telephone operating expenses due to the large increase in lines and cellular subscribers, despite the decline in value of the Guyana dollar. The trend for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was similar, and income from telephone operations increased by 17% to $18.6 million from $15.9 million in the comparable period of 2003.
 
Other operations, comprised of Choice Communications ("Choice") and Call Home Telecom ("CHT") in the United States Virgin Islands and Atlantic Tele-Center ("ATC") in Guyana, reported a loss of $1.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, an increase of $469,000 over the comparable period of 2003. The increased loss from other operations was primarily due to
increased expenses at Choice. Increased depreciation expense (reflecting increased investment in plant and the growth in TV subscribers), sales and support expenses, and legal costs together more than offset a 28% increase in revenues stemming from growth in TV service revenue. Management cut call center expenses at ATC by $173,000 or 36% compared to the comparable quarter, but the savings were substantially offset by increased costs associated with the start-up expenses of ATC's Atlantic Tele-Satellite business. Operating losses at CHT narrowed by $70,000 during the quarter ended June 30, 2004 on improved collection experience and expense management. For the six month period ended June 30, 2004, other operations recorded a loss of $2.9 million compared to a loss of $2.0 million during the comparable period of 2003 due to increased expenses at Choice and a reduction in revenues from CHT.
 
Equity in the earnings of Bermuda Digital Communications, our cellular operator in Bermuda, was $690,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2004, a 20% increase compared to the three months ended June 30, 2003. The increase in equity in earnings primarily reflects increased roaming and long distance revenues, which partly stems from a 10% increase in cellular subscribers to 18,302 at June 30, 2004, compared to a year ago. For the first six months of this year, the Company's equity in earnings from BDC rose only 6% to $1.2 million, compared to equity in earnings of $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003, reflecting a weaker quarter of 2004.
 
The Company recorded other income of $397,000 and $1.7 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2004, compared to losses of $185,000 and $255,000 in the comparable periods of 2003. This improvement is primarily the result of foreign exchange losses of $467,000 and $758,000 recorded during the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2003 compared to gains of $17,000 and $962,000 during the comparable periods of 2004.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "Our Guyana subsidiary continues to benefit from its significant ongoing investments in additional wireline and wireless infrastructure. However, our growth in profits from the resulting increased lines and handsets in service is hampered by the decline in value of the Guyana dollar. In U.S. dollar terms, the basic monthly service charge for local service is down to $2.43, the lowest in the Caribbean. The businesses represented by our other operations category continue to perform poorly and we have continued to take a hard look at the expenses of other operations to better align costs with revenues. As a result, during the quarter we took steps to decrease selling expenses at Choice while adding much needed local talent in product marketing and field support. We also worked diligently to reduce operating losses at ATC's call center business. Our Bermuda cellular affiliate recovered nicely from a weak first quarter and was able to achieve a significant increase in cellular subscribers from the first quarter and a 20% increase in profits from the second quarter of 2003. BDC also launched some exciting new services and continued to see growth in roaming revenue."

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (October 28, 2004) Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK) today reported that earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 were $3.6 million, or $0.71 per share, compared to earnings of $3.1 million, or $0.62 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, an increase of 14%. For the first nine months of 2004 earnings totaled $10.1 million or $2.01 per share, compared to earnings of $9.1 million, or $1.80 per share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, an increase of 12%. The Company's third quarter 2004 earnings were also up nearly 6% from its second quarter 2004 earnings of $3.4 million or $0.67 per share.
 
Telephone operating revenues were $22.2 million in the third quarter, compared to $19.7 million for the third quarter of 2003, an increase of 12%. More than a third of this increase is due to an approximately $1 million settlement of amounts owed to GT&T by a large international carrier that were significantly past due. Excluding the effect of this settlement, telephone operating revenues grew by 7% in the third quarter of 2004 and international long distance revenues posted a 12% increase on a 22% increase in international traffic at GT&T. Local exchange service revenues were $8.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 and were in line with the comparable quarter of 2003. Over the past twelve months, GT&T's cellular subscribers increased by 34% to 143,945 and wireline subscribers (access lines) increased by 10% to 98,390. The increased lines and handsets in service, as well as improved collections experience, contributed to the increase in international long distance traffic and revenues. Local exchange revenues, which are billed and paid in local currency, while growing in local currency terms, remained essentially flat in U.S. Dollar terms due to the reduced value of the Guyana dollar. Telephone operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 increased by 9% ($5.1 million) over the comparable period of 2003 to $62.1 million largely due to a 16% ($4.9 million) increase in international long distance revenues. Without the carrier settlement, telephone operating and international long distance revenues increased 7% and 13%, respectively for the nine months ended September 30, 2004.
Income from telephone operations increased to $11.4 million in the third quarter of 2004, as compared to $8.9 million for the period ended September 30, 2003, an increase of $2.5 million or 28%. Total telephone operating expenses were $10.8 million during the three months ended September 2004, down $49,000 over the comparable period of 2003. Telephone operating expenses increased 458,000 or 6% due to the large increase in lines and cellular subscribers, despite the decline in value of the Guyana dollar. This was offset by a $371,000 or 22% decline in international long distance expenses resulting from lower average outbound termination rates and a $136,000 or 8% reduction in general and administrative expenses. The trend for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was similar, and income from telephone operations increased by 21% to $30.0 million from $24.8 million in the comparable period of 2003.
 
Other operations, comprised of Choice Communications ("Choice") and Call Home Telecom ("CHT") in the United States Virgin Islands and Atlantic Tele-Center ("ATC") in Guyana, reported a loss of $1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, an increase of $128,000 over the comparable period of 2003The increased loss from other operations was primarily due to increased expenses at Choice of $339,000 attributable to increased depreciation expense and cost of sales, reflecting Choice's increased investment in plant and strong growth in TV subscribers. Total revenues at Choice increased by approximately $63,000 or 5% during the quarter ended September 30, 2004 led by a 35% increase in TV service revenue which was largely offset by a 14% decline in Choice's other revenues mainly due to increased competition. In the third quarter of 2004, ATC successfully concluded a wholesale arrangement with another call center company, and we expect that this agreement will cover substantially all of the cash costs of running the call center business while it remains in place. This arrangement, combined with better expense management, contributed to $418,000 reduction in call center losses at ATC, an improvement of 68% compared to the year earlier quarter. However, the savings were partly offset by costs associated with the start-up of ATC's Atlantic Tele-Satellite business.Operating losses at CHT increased by $171,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2004 due to lower revenues and bad debt expense.For the nine month period ended September 30, 2004, other operations recorded a loss of $4.5 million compared to a loss of $3.5 million during the comparable period of 2003 due to increased expenses at Choice and a reduction in revenues from CHT.
.
 
Equity in the earnings of Bermuda Digital Communications ("BDC"), our cellular operator in Bermuda, was $828,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2004, a 56% increase compared to the three months ended September 30, 2003. The increase in BDC's earnings reflects increased airtime, roaming and long distance revenues. The increase in airtime and long distance revenue partly stems from a 6% increase in cellular subscribers, as well as increased average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). BDC
 
ended the quarter with 18,575 subscribers. BDC entered into CDMA roaming agreements with the two largest US CDMA carriers, along with certain other carriers, in late 2003 and early 2004. These arrangements drove the increase in long distance and roaming revenues, from both BDC's subscribers traveling abroad and visitors to Bermuda. For the first nine months of this year, the Company's equity in earnings from BDC rose by 22% to $2.0 million, compared to equity in earnings of $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. The lower rate of growth for the nine months reflects a weaker first quarter of 2004.
 
The Company recorded other expense of $114,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2004 and other income of $1.5 million during nine months ended September 30, 2004, compared to other income of $199,000 and other expense of $55,000 in the comparable periods of 2003. This improvement is partly the result of foreign exchange losses of $127,000 and $884,000 recorded during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2003 compared to gains of $6,000 and $968,000 during the comparable periods of 2004. In addition, during the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company recorded a charge of $500,000 to adjust the carrying value of certain assets to their current market value.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "We are pleased by the continued strength of GT&T's operations, coupled with management's tenacity in pursuing international carriers for payment in full of amounts owed to GT&T for inbound traffic. In the third quarter, GT&T also achieved a significant milestone in accepting its first subscribers on its new GSM/GPRS network, and we look forward to offering new data and roaming services to our customers in the near future. BDC, our cellular affiliate in Bermuda, also had a strong quarter and continues to roll out new technologies and services to great enthusiasm in its market. In the third quarter, BDC launched CDMA/EVDO mobile broadband data services, continuing its role as technology leader in a very demanding market.
 
"In other operations, we continue to take a hard look at all of these business units to see where we can improve our performance. While we had some success as a result of our cost-cutting efforts at all units, we continue to be disappointed by the rate of improvement. On the positive side, Choice continues to record strong growth in TV subscribers, despite a cut in selling expenses. We were also proud of the deal we struck at ATC with another call center company. This deal should cover our near-term costs of operating that business, while at the same time preserving and indeed expanding the jobs associated with the business in Guyana. We still believe that Guyana has some promise as a call center location, with its well educated, English-speaking workforce, its proximity to North American markets and the excellent connectivity that we can provide through GT&T."
 
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. is a telecommunications company with headquarters in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.

ST. THOMAS, U.S. Virgin Islands January 25, 2005 Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK), announced that its Guyana operations were affected by severe flooding over the past week. The flooding resulted from persistent heavy rains, which began in earnest around January 15, with cumulative precipitation reportedly well over 50 inches in the period ending January 23rd. Floodwater accumulations averaging between two and five feet affected nearly 25 miles of coastal Guyana. Regions 3 and 4 of the country, which includes the East Coast, were declared a disaster area and standing water remains at three feet. There were some injuries and fatalities reported and the damage to residential and commercial property is likely to be substantial. The weather has turned drier, but flooding remains a problem.
 
Both ATN's Guyana Telephone & Telegraph (GT&T) and Atlantic Tele-Center (ATC) subsidiaries were affected. GT&T's East Coast exchange in Beterverwagting was the hardest hit and there have been interruptions to both wireline and wireless service, although service was substantially restored in all areas by January 23. International service was maintained throughout the flood. ATC's call center facility, also located on the East Coast, suffered from 18 inches of standing water inside the building. The facility is closed while ATC staff work on removing the water and repairing the damage.
 
Work has also begun on repairing the damage caused to GT&T's equipment and infrastructure, although it will likely be some time before that work is complete. It is too early to precisely gauge the effect of this extreme weather on ATN's operating results for the first quarter of 2005. ATC will certainly suffer losses due to lost revenue and some property damage. GT&T incurred extraordinary labor and material costs and suffered a prolonged traffic outage in one exchange, but, at the present time, the flooding is not expected to have a significant negative impact on ATN's consolidated results, or GT&T's results, for the first quarter. Of course, our focus to date has been on restoring service and protecting our facilities from further damage. It is possible that the effect on our business and our operating results will be more severe than expected.
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company said, "I want to extend my sympathy to the staff of GT&T and ATC, as well as their families and the people of Guyana, as they try to cope with this unprecedented deluge. I also want to commend the staff of GT&T for their heroic performance in maintaining and restoring service. Managers and staff alike worked night and day together in an all-out effort to minimize any disruption of critical communication services to their customers. The fact that international service was maintained throughout aided the provision of international assistance and mitigated the financial impact on GT&T. We are proud of their efforts and pleased that they were able to restore services to our customers so promptly while protecting the switch equipment in all our exchanges. Management of GT&T were able to respond to direct requests for communications assistance and donated services and equipment to some key emergency and health personnel to aid in their efforts."
 
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. is a telecommunications company with headquarters in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.

ST. THOMAS U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (March 8, 2005) Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK) today reported its operating results for both the year and quarter ended December 31, 2004. ATN reported net income for the full year of $12.1 million, or $2.41 per share, compared to earnings of $12.2 million, or $2.44 per share ($2.43 diluted), for 2003, a decrease of 1%. ATN posted net income for the quarter of $2.0 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to net income of $3.2 million, or $0.64 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2003. However, excluding the effects of $3.4 million in non-cash charges stemming from asset write-downs and a $1.8 million benefit associated with the recording of a tax asset, net income would have been $13.7 million, or $2.72 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2004, and $3.5 million, or $0.70 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 12% and 10%, respectively, over the year earlier periods.
 
For the full year 2004, telephone operating revenues rose 6% to $84.0 million, as compared to $78.9 million for 2003. International long distance revenues posted a 12% increase on an 18% increase in international traffic at the Company's principal operating subsidiary, the Guyana Telephone & Telegraph Company Ltd. (GT&T). During 2004, GT&T's cellular subscribers increased by 27% to 150,851 and wireline subscribers (access lines) increased by 11% to 103,267. This growth in lines and handsets in service contributed to the increase in international long distance traffic and revenues.
 
Local exchange service revenues were $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2004 and were essentially in line with 2003 results, despite the decline in the value of the Guyana dollar, which eroded growth in this category. The increase in GT&T's base of wireline and cellular subscribers during the year contributed additional Guyana dollar denominated revenues, which essentially offset the impact of the currency's decline. The growth in access lines mainly reflects the successful completion of the planned rollout of service to new areas of Guyana. On the cellular side, GT&T was able to expand its capacity and also commenced offering GSM/GPRS services and handsets in the fourth quarter in an overlay to its existing TDMA network.
Income from telephone operations increased to $40.9 million in 2004, as compared to $34.5 million in 2003, an increase of $6.4 million or 19%. The improved margins are primarily attributable to a $2.0 million or 28% reduction in international long distance expenses due to more efficient routing of outbound traffic and a $0.6 million or 9% reduction in general and administrative expenses on lower compensation and related expenses, among other things. These savings were partially offset by a $1.3 million or 4% increase in telephone operating expenses (which includes depreciation expense) due to the large increase in GT&T's lines and cellular subscribers.
 
Net income from Bermuda Digital Communication's (BDC) cellular operations in Bermuda were up 25% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, with the Company's equity in the earnings of BDC rising to $2.6 million from $2.0 million in 2003. Both increases reflect increased airtime, long distance and roaming revenues. The increase in airtime and long distance revenue partly stems from a 14% increase in cellular subscribers, as well as increased average revenue per subscriber (ARPU). Between the end of 2003 and early 2004, BDC entered into roaming agreements with the two largest U.S. CDMA carriers. These arrangements drove the increase in long distance and roaming revenues, from both BDC's subscribers traveling abroad and visitors to Bermuda. BDC ended the year with over 20,000 subscribers, as compared to approximately 17,800 subscribers at the end of 2003.
 
The Company's three smaller, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Choice Communications (Choice), Call Home Telecom (CHT), and Atlantic Tele-Center (ATC), are combined under the heading "Other Operations." Last year, revenues for other operations climbed 20% over 2003 levels but the loss of $6.3 million, before non-cash charges recorded in the fourth quarter, was 15% higher than 2003. The increased loss from other operations was primarily due to increased expenses at Choice of $1.9 million attributable to increased depreciation and compensation expense and TV programming costs. The increase in those items reflects Choice's additional investment in plant and strong growth in TV subscribers. Total revenues at Choice increased by approximately $668,000, or 15%, during the year, led by a 66% increase in TV service revenue, but was negatively impacted by an 11% decline in Choice's other revenues, mainly due to attrition in Choice's dial-up internet base. As to CHT, given the very small size of its collect-calling business and lack of prospects for growth, management has decided to terminate CHT's collect-calling operations and expects to re-deploy its assets to support the wholesale transport of traffic to Guyana and elsewhere.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2004, ATC's wholesale call center customer defaulted. As a result of the default, the Company is considering strategic alternatives. ATC's operations were further impacted by the flooding in Guyana in January 2005, which caused significant damage to the main facility.
 
In reviewing results for other operations, management determined that it was appropriate to record approximately $2.8 million in non-cash asset impairment charges. Based on the default of ATC's wholesale customer, the Company concluded that ATC's call center assets were impaired as of year-end and recorded a charge of $1.2 million against the $1.7 million of these assets on its books. Furthermore, given Choice's continued losses, management concluded that the goodwill and certain other intangibles on Choice's balance sheet were impaired and recorded a charge of $1.6 million in the fourth quarter. The Company also recorded a charge of $570,000 related to the write-off of secured loans made in connection with its investment in LighTrade, Inc. in 2001 as the recovery of these amounts is no longer likely. Additionally, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $1.8 million in the fourth quarter due to the reversal of a valuation allowance, which had previously been provided against certain tax assets. Taken together, these items reduced net income for the full year 2004 and fourth quarter by approximately $1.6 million.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "Our two largest contributing units, GT&T and BDC, continued to show healthy growth in subscribers, revenues, profits and cash flows in 2004. GT&T managed the continued growth of its wire-line and wireless networks, including the addition of over 32,000 cellular subscribers and over 10,000 new access lines, mainly in areas that had been without service. In addition, in October of 2004, GT&T celebrated the successful launch of GSM/GPRS cellular services, prior to the launch of services by a new cellular service provider in Guyana in December. More recently, we were extremely proud of the efforts of the staff and management of GT&T in fighting to maintain service in January 2005 in the face of unprecedented flooding of some of the major service areas. Our BDC affiliate also had an impressive year, with strong revenue growth due to breaking the 20,000 subscriber level and expanding roaming revenue through arrangements with Sprint and Verizon. Management fees and dividends paid to ATN by BDC last year exceeded $1.8 million. BDC is rolling out high-speed mobile data services (known as EVDO) in the first quarter of 2005 and we are hopeful that this will provide another source of growth and profits for that business.
 
"Unfortunately, the smaller units reported under "other operations" continue to detract from the Company's overall performance. We wrote down ATC's call center assets and we have ceased CHT's collect calling business and are re-deploying its limited assets. We do not expect either of these businesses to have a significant impact on our results in 2005. Our Choice subsidiary, which is a CATV and internet provider in the US Virgin Islands, appears to have improved business prospects with TV revenues up 66% last year and demand for broadband data services expanding. We are working hard to accelerate growth and reduce operating losses and will continue to watch this carefully."
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2004 telephone operating revenues were $21.9 million, and were in line with the fourth quarter of 2003. Total minutes of use were essentially flat during the quarter despite the increase in cellular subscribers and lines in service. The average revenue per minute was lower due to a continued shift in the mix of traffic but income from telephone operations was up about 12%. International long distance revenues for the quarters ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 include approximately $527,000 and $750,000, respectively, related to traffic generated in prior periods as GT&T received payment on settled disputes with international carriers. The Company's fourth quarter 2004 earnings, when adjusted to exclude the net effect of write-offs and other adjustments, were essentially in line compared to earnings from the third quarter of 2004.

ST. THOMAS, U.S. Virgin IslandsMarch 11, 2005Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK), announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share, payable on April 11, 2005 on all common shares outstanding to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2005.
 
In addition, ATN today announced that its Board of Directors accepted the resignation (effective June 1, 2005) of the current General Manager and CEO of its subsidiary Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company, Limited (GT&T), Ms. Sonita Jagan. Ms. Jagan has been with GT&T for the last 12 years holding various positions of increasing responsibility within the Company, including Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Jagan is leaving Guyana to join her husband in Romania.
 
Ms. Jagan will be replaced by Mr. Joseph Singh, 59, whose past positions include Major General of the army of Guyana, and most recently, Executive Director of Conservation International Guyana. Mr. Singh holds an undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences from the University of Guyana as well as a Diploma in Public Administration from the same institution. In addition to earning many military honors and conservation awards, Mr. Singh was awarded numerous fellowships in various local and international organizations. It is expected that Mr. Singh will officially take over the duties as of June 1, 2005.
 
ATN Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., said "Earlier as Chief Financial Officer and for the last seven years as Chief Executive Officer, Sonita Jagan has been an outstanding company manager, leading GT&T from 13,500 subscribers to over 250,000 today, despite local rates that are the lowest in the Caribbean. She built a highly trained and motivated local staff, with fewer employees now than when ATN acquired its 80% interest in 1991. We will miss her strong voice and leadership, but expect to continue to benefit from her experience when she joins the GT&T Board after Mr. Singh takes over. Mr. Singh is a national hero in Guyana, having commanded the armed forces for presidents of both major political parties and having maintained peace despite several threats of serious domestic violence.

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (April 29, 2005) Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK) today reported earnings of $3.0 million, or $0.61 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, compared to earnings of $3.1 million, or $0.63 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, a decrease of 3%. However, excluding the effects of foreign exchange gains recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2004, net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 increased by approximately $300,000 or 12%. The Company's first quarter earnings were up 56% from reported fourth quarter 2004 earnings of $2.0 million, which included write-offs and other year-end adjustments of approximately $1.6 million. When adjusted to exclude these items from fourth quarter results, first quarter earnings were 13% lower consecutively due to seasonally higher revenues in the fourth quarter.
 
Telephone operating revenues rose by 10% to $21.3 million for the first quarter of 2005, as compared to $19.4 million for the first quarter of 2004. The increase in telephone operating revenues is principally attributable to an $810,000 or 10% increase in local exchange revenues reflecting continued growth in both cellular and wireline subscribers. GT&T's cellular subscribers increased by 29% to 165,763 at March 31, 2005 and wireline subscribers (access lines) increased by 12% to 105,702 for the same period. International traffic volumes climbed by 9% over volumes in the first quarter of 2004 leading to a $698,000 or 7% increase in GT&T's international long distance revenues. The growth in lines and handsets in service contributed to the increase in international long distance traffic and revenues.
 
Income from telephone operations increased to $9.5 million in the first quarter of 2005, as compared to $8.3 million for the period ended March 31, 2004, an increase of $1.2 million or 14%. Total telephone-operating expenses increased by 6% to $11.8 million. The large increase in lines and cellular subscribers contributed to a $1.1 million or 13% increase in telephone operating expenses. This increase was partially offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses, primarily due to lower travel, legal and professional fees, and an 8% decline in international long distance expenses resulting from more efficient routing of outbound traffic.
 
The Company's three smaller, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Choice Communications (Choice), Call Home Telecom (CHT), and Atlantic Tele-Center (ATC), are combined under the heading "Other operations" on our statement of operations. For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, we recorded a loss for these operations of $1.6 million, or 26% higher than the loss reported for the comparable period of 2004. The widening loss on other operations was primarily due to an increase in expenses at Choice, particularly increased compensation expense, depreciation, and TV programming costs. The increase in these items mainly reflects Choice's continued investment in plant and growth in TV subscribers. While Choice's TV and broadband data business expanded rapidly, with TV revenues up 33%, its dial-up
internet subscriber base continued to decline and related revenues were 18% lower than in the first quarter of 2004. Losses at CHT and ATC were $314,000 combined for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, a $140,000 reduction in losses over the comparable quarter of 2004. Operations at CHT and ATC's call center business were substantially curtailed during 2004, as previously reported.
 
Equity in the earnings of Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC), our cellular operator in Bermuda, was $590,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2005, a 19% increase over the three months ended March 31, 2004. The increase in earnings primarily reflects higher airtime revenues on a 16% increase in subscribers from 17,614 at March 31, 2004 to 20,400 at March 31, 2005. BDC recently launched "EV-DO" high-speed mobile voice and data services and expects these services will begin to make a positive impact on operating results in coming quarters.
 
Other income, excluding the effect of the Company's equity in earnings in BDC, was $434,000 in the first quarter of 2005, compared to $1.25 million in the first quarter of 2004. This decline is the result of a foreign exchange gain of $945,000 recorded in the quarter ended March 31, 2004 due to the revaluation at that time of GT&T's Guyana dollar assets and liabilities reflecting a 14% decline in the value of the Guyana dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. There were no comparable gains during the March 2005 quarter.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "Our first quarter results reflect similar factors to those prevalent in 2004 - GT&T and BDC continue to grow subscribers and revenues, without undue pressure on margins, and the smaller businesses in other operations continue to struggle. The results of our telephone operations for the first quarter are particularly impressive when considered in light of the major flooding in Guyana in January. As reported previously, our staff did an excellent job in restoring service and limiting the negative impact on our customers and operating results and we at ATN also made a significant cash donation to the civil services to help speed the recovery of the affected areas. We are also pleased with the way GT&T has responded to the new competitor in the cellular market and the continued strength of demand for GT&T's Cellink services."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
Adoption of 2005 Restricted Stock and Incentive Plan
 
On May 18, 2005 the shareholders of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company"), upon the recommendation of the Company's Board of Directors, approved the Company's 2005 Restricted Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan") which was adopted by the Board of Directors on March 11, 2005. The 2005 Plan became effective on May 18, 2005 and will terminate upon the earlier of the tenth anniversary thereof or the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan have been issued pursuant to any awards.
 
The Board believes that the 2005 Plan will enable the Company to motivate and reward superior performance on the part of its officers and key employees and thereby retain and attract individuals of superior ability. The 2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock, representing approximately 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock. The 2005 Plan is incremental to the Company's existing 1998 Stock Option Plan (the "Option Plan"). The Board believes that the ability of the Compensation Committee to grant options under the Option Plan, or restricted shares under the 2005 Plan, provides flexibility in compensation management. At this time, the Board and the Compensation Committee believe that restricted stock grants are preferable to the grant of options taking into account anticipated changes in accounting rules. More importantly, while both restricted stock grants and options provide incentives for long-term growth, the Board and the Compensation Committee believes that adding restricted stock grants to the compensation mix at this time will better align the interests of the grant recipients with stockholders resulting from bearing the risks of current ownership and access to cash dividends.
 
Provisions have been included in the 2005 Plan to meet the requirements for deductibility of executive compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)") with respect to certain grants permitted under the 2005 Plan as performance-based compensation, though not all grants will so qualify. The 2005 Plan provides the flexibility to provide for the grant of restricted stock, subject to vesting, the grant of the right to purchase restricted stock and the grant of performance shares, where the actual number of shares granted depends on future performance. At the present time, however, the Compensation Committee and the Board intend to apply the 2005 Plan to grant shares of restricted stock subject to certain vesting requirements to be determined by the Compensation Committee.
 
Purpose of the 2005 Plan
 
The purpose of the 2005 Plan is to secure for the Company the benefits arising from capital stock ownership by those employees and officers of the Company responsible for the Company's future growth and continued success.
 
Administration of the 2005 Plan
 
The 2005 Plan provides that the selection of participants in the 2005 Plan, and the terms and conditions of each award, will be determined by the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee or such other committee appointed by the Board of Directors, which will consist of at least two members of the Board of Directors. Each member of any such committee will be a "non-employee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m). In adopting the 2005 Plan and submitting it to the stockholders for approval, the Board of Directors delegated its powers under the 2005 Plan to the Company's Compensation Committee (the "Committee"), which satisfies those requirements. The Committee will have full power, discretion and authority to interpret, construe and administer the 2005 Plan, and all decisions, determinations or actions of the Committee pursuant to the 2005 Plan will be final and binding on all persons for all purposes. Stock issued pursuant to the Plan may be subject to such restrictions on transfer, vesting, repurchase rights or other restrictions as may be determined by the Board of Directors, which may also establish circumstances under which such conditions may be waived, including acceleration of vesting in the event of a change in control or in other circumstances as reflected in a particular Stock Restriction
Agreement. The Board or the Committee may delegate its powers as it deems appropriate, but may not delegate responsibility to make awards to executive officers, make awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) or certify the satisfaction of performance objectives for purposes of Section 162(m). Section 162(m) limits the deductibility to the employer of certain compensation to executive officers unless the compensation is deemed to be "performance-based."
 
Eligibility
 
All officers and employees of the Company and any parent or subsidiaries of the Company are eligible to receive awards under the 2005 Plan. At the present time, there is a total pool of approximately 700 persons who would technically be eligible to receive awards under the 2005 Plan. At this time, however, the Committee does not anticipate making awards to employees of subsidiaries except, in some cases, for high-level management of subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are not eligible to receive awards under the 2005 Plan.
 
Types of Awards that May Be Made Under the 2005 Plan
 
The 2005 Plan permits the grant of:
 
 
 
 
Shares Covered by the 2005 Plan; Limit on Awards
 
The 2005 Plan permits the granting of awards covering 250,000 shares of Company common stock ("Common Shares"). The Common Shares may be either authorized but unissued Common Shares or Common Shares purchased on the open market. Any shares that are reserved for performance shares that lapse, expire or are forfeited, and any unvested shares of restricted stock that are reacquired by the Company, may be available for subsequent awards under the 2005 Plan.
 
Restricted Stock Awards
 
Under the 2005 Plan, the Committee may award Common Shares as restricted stock. The terms of the particular award would be set forth in a Stock Restriction Agreement authorized by the Committee. There would be a restriction period during which transfer of the Common Shares would be limited. The award could also be subject to vesting, with unvested Common Shares subject to forfeiture in the event the recipient ceases to remain in the employ of the Company prior to vesting. If the recipient's employment terminates during the vesting period, the recipient would be required to return the unvested Common Shares to the Company. However, the Committee may provide complete or partial exceptions to this requirement, as it deems equitable. Vesting can be accelerated in certain circumstances. The recipient could not dispose of the Common Shares prior to the expiration of the restriction period. During this period, the recipient would be entitled to vote the Common Shares and, at the discretion of the Committee, receive dividends. Each certificate would bear a legend giving notice of the restrictions in the grant.
 
Under the 2005 Plan, the Committee also may authorize the sale of Common Shares to the employee in lieu of a grant, which Common Shares would be subject to a Stock Restriction Agreement with such conditions as may be authorized by the Committee.
 
Performance Shares and Goals
 
Performance shares are rights to receive cash or Common Shares (or a combination of cash and Common Shares), as determined by the Committee, on the achievement of certain performance goals over a specified performance period.
 
The Committee determines the performance objectives of awards of performance shares. Performance objectives may vary for participants and groups of participants and are based on the
performance goals that the Committee deems appropriate. The performance period and goals will be determined by the Committee prior to or reasonably promptly after the commencement of any performance period, but no later than the earlier of (i) ninety days after the commencement of the performance period or (ii) the day prior to the date on which 25 percent of the performance period has elapsed.
 
Performance goals may be expressed in terms of any of the following business criteria: net income; earnings per share; operating income; operating cash flow; earnings before income taxes and depreciation; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; increases in operating margins; reductions in operating expenses; sales growth in sales or return on sales; total stockholder return; return on equity; return on total capital; return on invested capital; return on assets; economic value added; cost reductions and savings; increase in surplus; and productivity improvements.
 
A performance goal may also be based on an executive's attainment of personal objectives with respect to the foregoing criteria or other criteria such as growth and profitability, customer satisfaction, leadership effectiveness, business development, negotiating transactions and sales or developing long-term business goals. Performance goals may be measured on a periodic, annual, cumulative or average basis and may be established on a corporate-wide basis or established with respect to one or more operating units, divisions, subsidiaries, acquired businesses, minority investments, partnerships or joint ventures.
 
Following the completion of each performance period, the Committee will certify in writing as to whether the performance goals and other material terms of the performance award have been achieved or met. Unless the Committee determines otherwise, performance awards will not be settled until the Committee has made this certification.
 
The Committee may reduce or eliminate performance awards for any employee for any reason. To the extent necessary to preserve the intended economic effects of the 2005 Plan, the Committee may also adjust the performance objectives or awards to take into account: (i) a change in corporate capitalization, (ii) a corporate transaction, (iii) a partial or complete liquidation of the Company or a subsidiary or (iv) a change in accounting or other relevant rules or regulations; provided, however, that no such adjustment may be made if it would cause the awards to fail to qualify as performance-based.
 
The Committee may structure the performance share awards as restricted stock units or any substantially similar instrument evidencing the right to receive a share of stock, or a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share of stock, at some future date upon the lapse of the applicable restrictions established by the Committee or upon the satisfaction of any applicable performance goals established by the Committee hereunder.
 
Benefit Recapture
 
To the extent provided in a recipient's particular Award agreement, the 2005 Plan provides that if a recipient terminates employment and becomes employed by a competitor of the Company within a year after the date of the receipt of any Award, the recipient is to pay to the Company an amount equal to the value of the Award measured by the amount reported as taxable compensation to the recipient by the Company for federal income tax purposes, without regard to any subsequent fluctuation in the market price of the shares of Common Stock of the Company. The grant of Awards is subject to the satisfaction of the following by the recipient: (i) the recipient is to refrain from engaging in any activity that in the opinion of the Board of Directors is competitive with any activity of the Company, (ii) the recipient is to refrain from otherwise acting in a manner inimical or in any way contrary to the best interests of the Company, and (iii) the recipient is to furnish the Company such information with respect to the satisfaction of the foregoing as the Board of Directors may reasonably request.
 
Amendment or Termination of the 2005 Plan

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (July 28, 2005) Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK) today reported earnings of $3.2 million, or $0.65 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, compared to earnings of $3.4 million, or $0.67 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, a decrease of 5%. Earnings for the most recent quarter were negatively impacted by a $270,000 charge for non-cash, stock-based compensation recorded during the quarter. As compared to its first quarter 2005 earnings of $3.0 million, the Company's second quarter earnings were up 6%.
 
Telephone operating revenues rose by 7% to $21.9 million for the second quarter of 2005, as compared to $20.5 million for the second quarter of 2004. The increase in telephone operating revenues is principally attributable to a $1.1 million or 13% increase in local exchange revenues reflecting continued growth in both cellular and wireline subscribers. GT&T's cellular subscribers increased by 32% to 181,019 at June 30, 2005 and wireline subscribers (access lines) increased by 13% to 108,622 for the same period. GT&T continued to see strong demand for its new GSM/GPRS services, with roughly 41,000 of its subscribers now on the new system. The expansion of GT&T's fixed line network also continued as management follows through on the major build-out activities, begun in 2004, to bring new areas into service. Guyana's fixed line teledensity is now around 16% and combined fixed and wireless penetration is around 40%. Despite the growth in subscribers, international traffic volumes and revenue remained relatively unchanged from the second quarter of 2004.
 
Income from telephone operations decreased to $9.5 million in the second quarter of 2005, as compared to $10.3 million for the period ended June 30, 2004, a decrease of $0.8 million or 8% as total telephone operating expenses increased by 21% to $12.4 million. This increase includes the non-cash stock-based compensation charge of $270,000 in the quarter ended June 30, 2005 associated with the partial vesting of approximately 17,000 shares of restricted stock granted to certain executives in May 2005. The large increase in lines and cellular subscribers contributed to a $1.6 million or 22% increase in telephone operating expenses. The increase in telephone operating expenses is primarily the result of increased selling and marketing expenses, including the cost of new GSM handsets, and increased costs associated with operating a larger network and servicing more subscribers.
 
The Company's three smaller, wholly-owned subsidiaries, Choice Communications (Choice), Call Home Telecom (CHT), and Atlantic Tele-Center (ATC), are combined under the heading "Other Operations" on our statement of operations. For the quarter ended June 30, 2005, we recorded a loss for these operations of $1.4 million, or 15% lower than the loss reported for the comparable period of 2004. The improvement in other operations was primarily due to the previously reported curtailment of the operations of CHT and ATC during 2004. Choice continued its strong growth in cable
television and broadband data (wDSL) subscribers with television subscribers alone rising by 36% over the past year. However, as in 2004 and the first quarter, the revenue generated by these gains was partly offset by an 18% decline in dial-up internet subscribers. Furthermore, Choice operating expenses increased by 9% for the second quarter of 2005 compared to the year earlier quarter, with depreciation expense increasing 39% because of the expansion of Choice's network infrastructure.
 
Equity in the earnings of Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC), our cellular operator in Bermuda, was $796,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2005, a 15% increase over the three months ended June 30, 2004. The increase in earnings primarily reflects higher airtime revenues on an 18% increase in subscribers from 18,302 at June 30, 2004 to 21,644 at June 30, 2005. The increased subscriber levels include a number of new data customers using BDC's new EV-DO network to obtain high-speed mobile data services. The second quarter of 2005 also saw increased roaming revenue over 2004.
 
Other income, excluding the effect of the Company's equity in earnings in BDC, remained relatively unchanged at $329,000 and $397,000 for the quarters ending June 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
 
Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "We continue to be pleasantly surprised by the capacity of GT&T and BDC to grow their cellular subscriber bases without unduly impacting operating margins. After over two quarters of head-on competition with a country-wide cellular competitor, GT&T is now showing that, like our Cellular One affiliate, BDC, in Bermuda, it can deliver a quality service that attracts and retains customers. Price matters, but customers also care deeply about service quality, customer service and features. BDC continues to be a technology and service leader in Bermuda, and GT&T is doing the same in Guyana. In this regard, our Choice subsidiary recently launched an innovative "plug and play" wireless broadband service, Choice WiMax, in our licensed spectrum that we hope will prove popular in the U.S. Virgin Islands."

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the aggregate interest, fees and other amounts required to be paid by Borrower to Lenders or any Lender hereunder are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity of the Indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders or any Lender for the use or the forbearance of the Indebtedness or Obligations evidenced hereby exceed the maximum permissible under Applicable Law. If under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the limit of such validity prescribed by Applicable Law then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limit of such validity and if under or from circumstances whatsoever Lenders or any Lender should ever receive as interest any amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, the amount of such interest that is excessive shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Obligations evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest. Additionally, should the method used for calculating interest (i.e., using a 360-day year) be unlawful, such calculation method shall be automatically changed to a 365-6-day year or such other lawful calculation method as is reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent. This provision shall control every other provision of this Agreement and all provisions of every other Loan Document.

Provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is then continuing, Borrower shall have the option to (i) select all or any part of a new borrowing to be a Base Rate Loan, a LIBOR Loan or, only under the Term Loan Facility, a Quoted Rate Loan, in the case of a Base Rate Loan in a principal amount equal to at least $100,000, in the case of a LIBOR Loan in a principal amount equal to $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, or, only under the Term Loan Facility, a Quoted Rate Loan in a principal amount equal to $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (ii) convert at any time all or any portion of a Base Rate Loan in a principal amount equal to $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof into a LIBOR Loan or, only under the Term Loan Facility, in a principal amount equal to $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof into a Quoted Rate Loan, (iii) upon the expiration of its Interest Period, convert all or any part of any LIBOR Loan or, only under the Term Loan Facility, a Quoted Rate Loan into a Base Rate Loan, and (iv) upon the expiration of its Interest Period, continue any LIBOR Loan or, only under the Term Loan Facility, a Quoted Rate Loan into one or more LIBOR Loans in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof or, only under the Term Loan Facility, one or more Quoted Rate Loans in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, for such new Interest Period(s) as selected by Borrower. Each LIBOR Loan shall be made under any one of the Revolver Facility or the Term Loan Facility, but may not be made under more than one Facility concurrently. During any period in which any Default or Event of Default is continuing, as the Interest Periods for LIBOR Loans or Quoted Rate Loans then in effect expire, such Loans shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan and the LIBOR and Quoted Rate options will not be available to Borrower until all Defaults and Events of Default are cured or waived. In the event Borrower fails to elect a LIBOR Loan or Quoted Rate Loan upon any advance hereunder or upon the termination of any Interest Period, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to have such amount constitute a Base Rate Loan. There shall be no more than an aggregate of five LIBOR Loans and Quoted Rate Loans Outstanding at any one time.

except as expressly set forth herein or therein. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none of Administrative Agent nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, Administrative Agent, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates have made any representation or warranty to it and that no act by Administrative Agent or any such Person hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Borrower, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to Administrative Agent that (i) it has, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, properties, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrower and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and extend credit to Borrower hereunder, and (ii) it will, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, properties, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrower. Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto (other than as expressly required herein). If Administrative Agent seeks the consent or approval of any Lenders to the taking or refraining from taking of any action hereunder, then Administrative Agent shall send notice thereof to each Lender. Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender any time that Requisite Lenders have instructed Administrative Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

No Agent shall be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them). In performing its functions and duties hereunder, Administrative Agent shall exercise the same care which it would in dealing with loans for its own account, but Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or for the financial condition of Borrower. Administrative Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents Administrative Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, Administrative Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever
Rights, Exculpation, Etc.

Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Administrative Agent as a result of Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders, except in connection with its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

Whether the advent of the new spectrum leasing set of rules would require the filing of a notification to the FCC (jointly by Commnet Illinois, LLCI and Cingular, LLC), is an open question. The matter is beyond Commnet Illinois, LLC's control, as such a filing is a joint filing, and would have to be signed by Cingular, LLC as well as Commnet Illinois, LLC. The violation would be a joint violation by both Commnet Illinois, LLC and Cingular, LLC.
 
 
As with most rural carriers, Commnet Wireless, LLC and its "Subsidiaries" and "Company Investments", as those terms are defined in the Merger Agreement (the "Commnet Group"), face substantial obstacles to achieving full compliance with FCC rules pertaining to "enhanced 911" ("E911"). As with other rural carriers, the Commnet Group filed a request for waiver with the FCC. While those waiver requests were pending, the FCC issued a Public Notice advising all carriers with pending waiver requests to supplement those requests with additional information, and the Commnet Group in its view did so in a timely manner. It is the belief of the Commnet Group that the FCC staff misplaced that supplement. As a result, when the FCC issued its recent E911 decision, , FCC Rcd. (FCC 05-79, released April 1, 2005) (""), the FCC held that because the Commnet Group alone had failed to file a supplement with the requested additional information, the Commnet Group's request for a waiver was denied without prejudice to refiling with additional information. at  109-110.

The Commnet Group filed a petition for reconsideration that the Commnet Group believes was timely, attaching the previously-filed supplement, and arguing that the factual basis for the FCC's decision (, that no supplement had been previously filed) was incorrect, and that the Commnet Group was therefore entitled to the same relief afforded to the other rural carriers. That unopposed petition for reconsideration remains pending. Commnet Wireless, LLC's regulatory counsel was advised in an oral and non-binding communication from FCC staff personnel that the supplement had been timely filed and should have been considered when the was released.

PRESS RELEASE: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
For further information:
 
 
 
ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (September 15, 2005) - Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN") (AMEX:ANK) announced today that it has completed its acquisition of 95% of Commnet Wireless LLC. ATN paid slightly less than $59 million to complete the acquisition, including the repayment of approximately $5.4 million in Commnet debt. ATN used cash on hand of approximately $12 million and additional debt of $47 million to pay the purchase price. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved the acquisition in August.
 
Management expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings for the fourth quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter, ATN will file, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, historical financial statements for Commnet as well as pro forma combined financial statements for ATN and Commnet, which will provide further detail on Commnet's financial condition and operating results and the effect of consolidation with ATN.
 
The debt financing was provided through a new $70 million bank facility led by CoBank, a major lender to rural telecommunications companies in the United States. ATN's existing lender, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, also participated. The facility is composed of a $50 million, five-year, 5.875% non-amortizing term loan and a $20 million revolving line of credit. ATN drew $7 million from the revolver at closing at LIBOR plus 1.25%. In addition to payment of a portion of the Commnet purchase price, ATN used these advances to repay $10 million in principal amount of outstanding debt at ATN under its previous loan facility. Post-closing, ATN expects to have approximately $59 million in consolidated debt outstanding, as compared to approximately $12 million as of June 30, 2005.
 
Commnet serves national, regional and local mobile carriers by providing them with low-cost roaming services and related network support in areas that would otherwise not be cost-effective for those carriers to serve. Commnet owns and operates mobile wireless networks in rural areas of Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North and South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wyoming. Commnet will become a subsidiary of ATN and will continue to be managed by Brian Schuchman and his management team. Mr. Schuchman will remain a 5% owner of Commnet.
"We are delighted to be able to close this transaction ahead of schedule," said Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman and CEO of ATN. "We expect Commnet to contribute to our growth and we are very happy to welcome the Commnet executives and other employees to our family of companies. We also are pleased that the strong balance sheet we had built up in recent years enabled us to negotiate our new bank facility on excellent terms."
 
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. is a telecommunications company with headquarters in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Its principal subsidiary, Guyana Telephone and Telegraph Company, Limited, is 80% owned by ATN and is the national telephone service provider in the Cooperative Republic of Guyana for all local, long-distance and international service, as well as the largest cellular service provider. ATN also owns 44% of Bermuda Digital Communications Ltd., providing cellular voice and data services in Bermuda as Cellular One; and 100% of Choice Communications, LLC, providing wireless television and broadband and dial-up data services as the largest Internet service provider and the only wireless TV provider in the United States Virgin Islands.
 
Commnet Wireless, LLC, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is a network-based provider of wholesale wireless services. Through strategic roaming alliances with national, regional and local wireless carriers, Commnet provides its partners with affordable roaming voice and data services in rural areas throughout the United States. Commnet currently operates networks with GSM/GPRS, TDMA, CDMA and analog technologies in both the 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands.
 
This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States federal securities laws, including without limitation Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements may relate to, among other matters, ATN's future financial performance and results of operations, management's plans and strategy for the future, market conditions, and management's expectations relating to the integration of Commnet with ATN and future levels of indebtedness. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results. Actual future events and results could differ materially from these statements as a result of many factors, including matters discussed in the Company's Form 10-K annual report for the year ended December 31, 2004, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as material changes in the United States communications industry or regulation, changes in communications technology, changes in Commnet's key customer and vendor relationships and the risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses. ATN undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors that may affect such forward-looking statements.

ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS (November 2, 2005) Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (AMEX:ANK) today reported earnings of $4.4 million, or $0.89 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, compared to earnings of $3.6 million, or $0.72 per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, an increase of 22%. The Company's acquisition of Commnet Wireless late in the third quarter of 2005 and a large foreign exchange loss incurred in the third quarter of 2004 were the primary reasons for the substantial increase in quarterly earnings. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 totaled $10.7 million, or $2.15 per share, compared to $10.2 million, or $2.02 per share, for the first nine months of 2004. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 were positively impacted by an approximately $1.0 million net settlement of past due amounts owed to GT&T by a large international carrier, as well as a non-cash foreign exchange gain of approximately $1 million as a result of the decline in the value of the Guyana dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2004.
 
As was previously announced, the Company completed its acquisition of 95% of Commnet Wireless LLC on September 15, 2005, paying slightly less than $59 million by using approximately $12 million of the Company's cash on hand and $47 million of new borrowings. The Company will also assume approximately $5 million of Commnet's liabilities. Results for the third quarter of this year therefore include Commnet's operating results for the last 15 days of the quarter, as well as increased interest expense and other non-capitalized costs of the acquisition. The net result increased earnings for the quarter by approximately $0.04 per share. The Company will file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission later this month pro forma financial statements showing the impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for recent reporting periods as if the Commnet acquisition had been completed at the beginning of the relevant period, together with Commnet's stand-alone historical financial statements. The Commnet acquisition also contributed to the Company's decision to modify its presentation of its statements of operations to the format accompanying this release.
 
International long distance revenues were $11.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2005, a decline of 10% compared to revenues of $12.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2004. However, revenues for the 2004 quarter included a previously disclosed $1.0 million settlement of amounts owed to the Company's subsidiary, GT&T, by a large international carrier that were significantly past due and written off in a prior period. Excluding the $1.0 million settlement, international long distance revenues for the third quarter of 2005 would have decreased by 2% from 2004. This decrease occurred despite the expansion of GT&T's access lines and cellular subscribers. Wireline subscribers (access lines) increased to 111,000 from 98,000 as of September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively, an increase of 13%, as management
International Long Distance Revenues.
continued to follow through on the major build-out activities to bring new areas into service. GT&T's cellular subscriber base increased by about 75,000 subscribers, or 52%, from 144,000 to 219,000 at the end of September 30, 2004 and 2005, respectively. GT&T's management believes that unauthorized internet calling continues to dampen international long distance revenues, although this mainly impacts outbound calls. As can be seen in the accompanying tables, inbound long distance minutes, which are settled in U.S. dollars, actually increased by 5% over the same period. In addition, as noted below, management believes that some portion of recent cellular subscriber growth is the result of certain pre-paid customers having both TDMA and GSM handsets and therefore spreading their international calling over two subscriber accounts.
 
Cellular and local exchange revenues increased $2.4 million, or 28%, to $10.9 million for the third quarter of 2005 from $8.5 million for the third quarter of 2004. In the third quarter of 2005, this line item benefited from the addition of Commnet's roaming revenue for the last 15 days of the quarter, which amounted to approximately $1.5 million of revenue. Excluding Commnet, the increase in local exchange and cellular revenues was primarily due to an increase in cellular airtime revenue and other cellular revenue at GT&T because of the substantial expansion of the cellular subscriber base noted above. However, management believes that some portion of this subscriber growth is a result of certain existing TDMA pre-paid subscribers buying a GSM handset while still retaining their TDMA handsets and, therefore, for the time being, appearing as two subscribers. This phenomenon should resolve itself over time as those TDMA accounts become inactive. Despite this doubling up effect, management believes that the strong growth of GSM subscribers is quite significant in the face of head-on competition. Over 75,000 of GT&T's cellular subscribers as of September 30, 2005 are GSM subscribers.
Cellular and Local Exchange Revenues.
 
Internet and television revenues totaled $2.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, a 16% increase from revenues of $1.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Choice Communications, our Virgin Islands business, continued to lose Internet dial-up subscribers, while rapidly growing broadband subscribers, particularly subscribers to its new WiMax "plug and play" wireless broadband service marketed as ClearChoice. Choice's digital television subscriber base and related revenues continued to grow strongly, with television subscribers increasing from approximately 3,800 at September 30, 2004 to approximately 4,800 at September 30, 2005.
Internet and Television Revenues.
 
The large increase in GT&T's access lines and cellular subscribers and Choice's television subscribers contributed to a $1.4 million increase in operating expenses from $13.7 million to $15.1 million for the third quarters of 2004 and 2005, respectively, an increase of 10%. The increase in total operating expenses, however, also reflects the addition of Commnet's expenses of $0.9 million for the final 15 days of the quarter.
Operating Expenses.
 
Termination and access fees, which includes international long distance expense for GT&T, long distance expense for Commnet, and bandwidth and circuit costs for GT&T, Commnet and Choice, increased 14% to $1.6 million for the third quarter of 2005 from $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2004. However, without the addition of approximately $500,000 in such expenses for Commnet, this item would have shown significant improvement, as GT&T continued to reduce its long distance expense and Choice had lower circuit costs resulting from the decline of its dial-up subscriber base.
 
The most significant increase in operating expenses from the third quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2005 was a 29%, or $846,000, increase in engineering and operations expense. This item consists primarily of GT&T's network operating expenses, but also includes expenses of Choice and
Commnet. The increase is primarily the result of increased costs associated with operating a larger network at GT&T, including increased cellular license fees, as well as the higher per unit cost of fuel and power in Guyana. Increased costs associated with the expanded television and broadband network at Choice also contributed to this increase. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $226,000 or 18% for the 2005 quarter, primarily reflecting more aggressive marketing and sales initiatives at GT&T in connection with head-on competition for GSM market share in Guyana. Both GT&T and its main competitor launched GSM services in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
Depreciation and amortization expense rose by $225,000, or 6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2005 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2004, primarily reflecting the addition of Commnet for 15 days of the 2005 quarter. For Commnet, this includes the amortization of certain intangible assets recorded under the purchase method of accounting.
 
As a result of the above, the Company's operating income remained relatively unchanged from the third quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2005 at $9.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively.
 
Interest income increased by approximately $141,000 from the third quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2005 as a result of a rise in interest rates earned on the Company's cash balances and higher average cash balances. Interest expense increased from the third quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings under the Company's new credit facility to finance the acquisition of Commnet in September 2005. Other income/expense, which includes management fees received from non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, such as Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC), increased by $724,000 due to the increase in such fees received from BDC and the absence in 2005 of a large foreign exchange loss of $0.6 million incurred in the third quarter of 2004.
Other Income and Expenses.
 
Equity in the earnings of Bermuda Digital Communications, our cellular operator in Bermuda, was $898,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2005, an 8% increase over the three months ended September 30, 2004. The increase in earnings primarily reflects higher airtime revenues on a 21% increase in subscribers from 18,600 at September 30, 2004 to 22,500 at September 30, 2005, offset in part by an increase in operating expense as the organization has expanded. The increased subscriber levels include a number of new data customers using BDC's new EV-DO network to obtain high-speed mobile data services. The third quarter of 2005 also saw increased roaming and long distance revenue over 2004, as visitors from North America increasingly have handsets that are able to roam on BDC's network.

Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "We were delighted to see that our newest operating unit, Commnet Wireless, has already made a positive contribution to earnings and expect the Commnet acquisition to be accretive to our earnings for the fourth quarter as well. In light of the Commnet acquisition, and feedback from the investment community, we decided to change the way we present our income statement data. In the past, GT&T represented a substantial majority of our revenue, expense and profit, and our income statement followed the traditional regulated telecommunications business presentation. Now that we have added a substantial non-regulated business in Commnet and experienced significant growth in our non-exclusive cellular business in Guyana, we thought it important to report the revenue and expenses together for all of our consolidated units. We have also grouped depreciation and amortization for all our consolidated businesses into one line item on the income statement to make it easier for investors to quantify those non-cash expenses. We welcome investor questions and feedback on this change in presentation."
In other developments in the quarter, we were pleased to see continued subscriber growth across all of our businesses, since maintaining and growing market share is important to sustaining cash flows. It is noteworthy that the team at GT&T continues to do an excellent job of attracting and retaining GSM customers despite increased competition. GT&T this year has invested heavily in enlarging the reach, capacity, quality and functionality of the GSM network. Managing a rapid and careful conversion from the TDMA network to the new GSM network is GT&T's major challenge and objective over the next year or so. BDC's management team has also continued to defy normal expectationsadding subscribers and growing revenue and profits in a three-player, well-penetrated market. Choice too has seen significant growth in its broadband data and television subscribers, while continuing to experience attrition to its dial-up base."

The Members of Commnet Wireless, LLC
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Commnet Wireless, LLC and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable preferred units and members' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Commnet Wireless, LLC and subsidiaries at December 31, 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1. General
 
Commnet Wireless, LLC (Commnet Wireless or the Company), f/k/a Commnet Capital, LLC, was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on January 29, 2002. Under licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Commnet Wireless and its subsidiaries and affiliates provide cellular and PCS roaming services to wireless service providers operating in rural U.S. markets.
 
The Company's headquarters is in Atlanta, Georgia. Engineering facilities are based in Castle Rock, Colorado. Satellite engineering offices are also maintained strategically throughout the United States. All offices and facilities are leased.
 
The accompanying financial statements as of June 30, 2005, and for the six months that ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the related note disclosures, are unaudited and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of these financial statements. Although the Company believes the disclosures are adequate to make the information not misleading, certain information normally included in the footnotes prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States has been omitted as permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The results for the six months ended June 30, 2005 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2005.
 
 
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Commnet Wireless and all majority and wholly owned subsidiaries. Investments in which Commnet Wireless owns less than 50% and exercises significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 
Cash Equivalents
 
The Company considers all cash accounts which are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
 
Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts receivable consists primarily of trade accounts receivable from customers and are generally unsecured. Credit losses relating to these receivables have been within management's expectations. Expected losses are recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets using the specific identification method. The Company did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts at June 30, 2005 (unaudited) or December 31, 2004.
 
Property and Equipment
 
Property and equipment consist principally of switch and cell site equipment and are stated at cost. Provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally three to seven years.
 
Licenses
 
The Company's licenses are issued by the FCC and provide the right to offer wireless services in a designated area. In general, the licenses automatically renew every 20 years unless the holder initiates a termination. The Company has determined that these licenses have an indefinite life and, therefore, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, , the licenses are not amortized but are subject to an annual impairment test.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
 
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Roaming revenue is recognized in the period the services are provided. Management fees and switching fees are recognized in the period services are provided. Equipment sales are recorded when the equipment is delivered. Rental revenue is recognized in the period the equipment is being rented.
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes as the tax effects of the Company's activities are reported directly by the members on their respective tax returns.
 
Equity-Based Compensation
 
FASB Statement No. 123, (FAS 123), as amended by FASB Statement No. 148, , establishes accounting and reporting standards for equity-based employee compensation plans. As permitted by FAS 123, the Company has elected to account for its employee equity-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, (APB 25), and has elected the pro forma disclosure alternative of FAS 123. Although FAS 123 allows the Company to continue to follow APB 25 guidelines, pro forma compensation expense and pro forma net income would be approximately $32,000 (unaudited) and $3,852,000 (unaudited), respectively for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and $47,000 and $3,279,000, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2004, if the Company had adopted FAS 123. The inputs used for computing the fair value of the unit grants using the Black Scholes method are volatility of one, expected life of two years, no expected dividend yield, and a risk-free interest rate of 3.70%.

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure
Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the balance sheet and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
 
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
New Accounting Standard
 
The Company was required to adopt FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51 (the Interpretation) during 2004. The Interpretation adopts a new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation. The adoption of the Interpretation had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
 
3. Significant Customers
 
The Company has two significant customers who accounted for the following percentages of total revenues:

5. Investments
 
Investments in Affiliates
 
Investments in affiliates consist of the following:
 
 
The Company's 35% investment in MoCelCo, LLC (MoCelCo) was initially acquired by Commnet Wireless, Inc. (CWI), the Company's predecessor, in 2001 in exchange for a $1.0 million cash payment. During 2002, the investment was transferred to the Company in exchange for a $1.0 million note payable. During 2002, the Company contributed an additional $1,660,000 in cash to MoCelCo. Dividends received from MoCelCo for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $262,500.
 
In November 2002, the Company paid $1.0 million to acquire a 7.75% interest in Commnet of Florida, LLC (Commnet Florida) from Monroe Telephone Services, LLC (Monroe). In addition, CWI had previously paid the FCC a $319,911 license fee on behalf of Monroe, which was transferred to the Company in exchange for an increase in the note payable. In July 2004, the Company paid $2.0 million to acquire an additional 16.5% interest in Commnet Florida. In July 2005, the Company paid $1.5 million to acquire an additional 12.375% interest in Commnet Florida (unaudited). In accordance with the Monroe purchase agreement, the Company is obligated to purchase an additional 12.375% interest in Commnet Florida for $1.5 million in July 2006.
 
The Company is accounting for its investments in MoCelCo, Commnet Florida and Tennessee Cellular using the equity method as it maintains significant influence over the operating and financial policies. The Company is accounting for its other investments in affiliates using the cost method.
 
 
 
 
5. Investments (continued)
 
In October 2004, all the assets of Prairie Wireless, LLC, of which the Company owned 24.04%, and four licenses owned by the Company were sold in two related transactions. The Company received net cash proceeds from these sales of $1,441,936. In addition, approximately $181,000 of purchase price has been placed in escrow to be released to the Company in April 2006 assuming no indemnification claims are made by the buyer. The Company has recorded this escrowed cash in prepaid expenses and other assets as of June 30, 2005 (unaudited) and other assets as of December 31, 2004.
 
In May 2005, the Company sold its five percent interest in Great Western Cellular Holdings, LLC for $1,164,968 in cash (unaudited).

Combined Financial Information
 
Summarized unaudited combined financial information for all equity method affiliates as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2004 follows:
 
 
 
 
6. Note Receivable From Affiliate
 
During 2001 and 2002, CWI and Commnet Wireless loaned $5,365,909 to Commnet Florida for the construction of a wireless network. In 2002, CWI transferred its portion of the note receivable to Commnet Wireless in exchange for a note payable, which was converted into common equity of the Company in August 2003. As of June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the total principal amount of the loan to Commnet Florida is $3,077,000 (unaudited) and $3,292,000, respectively.
 
The loan is in the form of a promissory note and is secured by a first lien on all the assets of Commnet Florida except its cellular license. Interest is payable quarterly under the promissory note at an annual rate of prime plus 1%, or 7.25% (unaudited) as of June 30, 2005.
 
Commnet Florida is required to make quarterly minimum principal payments on the loan in an amount equal to one-half of its operating profits from the preceding quarter. In addition, whenever Commnet Florida makes a cash distribution to its members, it must also make a principal payment on the loan equal to the amount being distributed. All amounts due under the promissory note must be repaid no later than September 18, 2009. Based on Commnet Florida's forecasted operating results for the next 12 months and the related principal payments projected to be made, the Company records a portion of the note receivable in current assets.
 
In connection with the network construction, Commnet Wireless acquired certain equipment from Commnet Supply, LLC (Commnet Supply), an equipment distributor related through common ownership at the time, in exchange for a note payable. A significant portion of this equipment was purchased at Commnet Supply's cost, which was below fair value. This equipment, along with equipment and services purchased from third-party suppliers, was subsequently sold for an agreed-upon amount of $5,365,909 to Commnet Florida in exchange for the note receivable. The gain on the sale of $608,868 was deferred and is being amortized into income as principal payments are made by Commnet Florida. During the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004, and the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company amortized $24,395 (unaudited), $64,678 (unaudited) and $102,736 of the deferred gain, respectively, into income.
 
 
 
7. Debt
 
Debt consists of the following:
 
 
Scheduled maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 are $1,550,000 in 2005, $650,000 in 2006, $650,000 in 2007 and $3,051,318 in 2008. The Company paid $256,000 (unaudited), $172,000 (unaudited) and $360,000 in interest during the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively.
 
Senior Notes Payable
 
During 2003, the Company borrowed funds from Commnet Supply that were payable on demand and earned interest at an annual rate of 6%. In December 2003, $900,000 of these advances was converted into a senior unsecured promissory note payable on December 22, 2005 with interest payable quarterly at an annual rate of 8%. In April 2004, in connection with the sale of Commnet Supply, the senior promissory note was converted into three notes for $300,000 each with the same terms and conditions. Commnet Supply then assigned these three notes to its three original owners who also are members of the Company.
 
Bank Term Loan
 
In November 2004, the Company received a term loan from its bank for $2.6 million. The loan is to be repaid in 48 monthly payments of $54,167 each beginning in December 2004 and ending on the loan's maturity date of November 15, 2008. Interest is payable monthly at an annual rate of prime plus one-half, or 6.75% (unaudited) as of June 30, 2005 and 5.75% at December 31, 2004.
 
The loan is secured by the Company's GSM switch and 43 GSM base stations. The loan agreement contains several negative covenants that restrict the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness and prohibit member distributions other than regular quarterly dividends on the redeemable preferred units and tax distributions as required by the Company's operating agreement.
 
 
 
7. Debt (continued)
 
Subordinated Debentures
 
In December 2003, the Company issued $2,455,485 of subordinated debentures in connection with the exchange of $330,000 of convertible notes and $2,125,485 in cash received from eight funds managed by Summit Partners (Summit), a private equity firm. The subordinated debentures are due on December 22, 2008, and bear interest at an annual rate of 10%. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears.
 
8. Redeemable Preferred Units
 
 
In December 2003, the Company issued 9,821.94 non-voting preferred units in connection with the exchange of $1,320,000 of convertible notes of the Company and $8,501,940 in cash received from eight funds managed by Summit. The preferred units are redeemable and provide the holders with a preferred annual cash return of 7.5% payable quarterly in arrears. There were no preferred dividends in arrears at June 30, 2005 (unaudited) or December 31, 2004.
 
 
 
8. Redeemable Preferred Units (continued)
 
Holders of a majority of the preferred units, currently Summit, may cause the Company to redeem all the preferred units on or after December 22, 2008, at a price equal to $1,000, the original issue price paid for the units, plus any accrued but unpaid preferred return. Redemption of the preferred units is mandatory upon the occurrence of: (i) a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary; (ii) a change in control of the Company; and (iii) an initial public offering of the Company. The redemption amounts for the preferred units were $9,821,940 at June 30, 2005 (unaudited) and December 31, 2004.
 
The initial carrying amount of redeemable preferred units was less than the redemption amount by the amount of redeemable preferred unit issuance costs of $972,623. The carrying amount of redeemable preferred units is being increased by periodic charges to retained earnings over the period of issuance to the December 22, 2008 redemption date.
 
9. Members' Equity
 
The following Class A, B, and C common units were authorized, issued, and outstanding at June 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004:
 
 
Class A, Class B, and Class C common units have the same relative voting, distribution, and liquidation rights, except that certain capital and administrative transactions of the Company cannot be consummated without the approval of the holders of a majority of the Class A common units, currently Summit. Class A, Class B, and Class C common units are subject to certain restrictions on transfer as set forth in the Company's Operating Agreement.
 
 
 
9. Members' Equity (continued)
 
In December 2003, the Company authorized 1,058 Class C common units for future issuance pursuant to option plans that may be adopted by the Company. Class C common units will entitle the holder thereof to receive distributions from the Company only if the aggregate of all distributions paid to date by the Company to all other units outstanding exceeds a fixed amount to be determined by the Company's Board of Managers (Hurdle Amount). Class C units vest monthly over a 48 month period with vesting accelerated upon a change of control in the Company.
 
In 2004, the Company issued 706 Class C units to Commnet Management, LLC, an entity owned by eight key employees of the Company. The first grant of 670 Class C units carries a Hurdle Amount of $16.0 million and vests from May 2004 to April 2008. The second grant of 36 Class C units carries a Hurdle Amount of $17.5 million and vests from September 2004 to August 2008. The Company did not record any compensation expense in 2004 related to the unit grants (see Note 2).
 
10. Lease Agreements
 
The Company has various operating leases for offices, switching centers and cell sites, which expire through 2012. Rent expense was $1,148,264 (unaudited), $562,547 (unaudited) and $1,379,613 for the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and the year ended December 31, 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2004, total future minimum rental commitments for these operating leases are as follows:
 
 
 
 
11. Employee Benefit Plan
 
The Company has established a salary deferral plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The plan allows eligible employees to contribute up to 15% of their compensation. Such contributions accumulate on a tax deferred basis until the employee withdraws the funds. The Company has elected to fund a matching contribution into the plan equal to 50% of the employees' contributions, up to 6% of their salary. Total expense for the Company's match during the six months ended June 30, 2005 and 2004 and year ended December 31, 2004 was $21,216 (unaudited), $18,786 (unaudited) and $37,071, respectively.
 
12. Subsequent Events (Unaudited)
 
On September 15, 2005, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN") and CW Acquisition, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ATN (the "Merger Sub"), completed the acquisition of 95% of the Company pursuant to a Merger Agreement dated July 26, 2005 between ATN, Merger Sub, the Company, each of the members of the Company and certain related parties named in the Merger Agreement. In connection therewith, 100% of the redeemable preferred units were redeemed and all of the Company's outstanding debt was repaid by ATN.
 

Exhibit 99.5
 
 
On September 15, 2005, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN" or the "Company") completed the acquisition of and merger with Commnet Wireless, LLC ("Commnet") pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated July 26, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement was previously described in a Form 8-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 29, 2005 and was filed as an exhibit thereto. In connection with the merger, Commnet is continuing as the surviving entity and owned 95% by ATN and 5% by Brian Schuchman, the Chief Executive Officer of Commnet. ATN paid approximately $59.6 million in consideration for Commnet including certain transaction expenses. ATN also assumed approximately $5.0 million of Commnet's liabilities.
 
Also on September 15, 2005, ATN, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of September 15, 2005 with (a) CoBank, ACB as Administrative Agent, Lead Arranger, and a Lender, and (b) Banco Popular de Puerto Rico as a Lender. The Credit Agreement which was previously described in a Form 8-K on September 21, 2005 and filed as an exhibit thereto, provides for a $50 million non-amortizing term loan (the "Term Loan") which accrues interest at 5.875% as well as a $20 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") which accrues interest at rates as defined within the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement shall terminate, and all amounts outstanding thereunder shall be due and payable in full on, October 31, 2010.
 
To fund the acquisition of Commnet and to repay approximately $10 million in principal amount of outstanding debt at ATN under a previous loan facility, the Company borrowed $50 million under the Term Loan, drew $7 million from the Revolver Facility and used an additional $12.4 million of its own cash. As of September 30, 2005, the Company has also accrued for $0.2 million of transaction fees. The amounts drawn under the Revolver Facility bear interest at a blended rate of LIBOR plus a margin, or approximately 5.5%.
 
In connection with the Commnet merger agreement, the Company placed $7.4 million of the purchase price in escrow as of September 30, 2005. Of this amount $2.0 million was released to the selling unit holders in November 2005 after successfully meeting certain working capital requirements. The remaining $5.4 million will be released in full in September 2006 assuming no indemnification claims are presented by ATN.
 
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the tangible and intangible assets acquired have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of September 15, 2005. The final allocation of the purchase price is pending completion of a third party valuation of the assets acquired. Depending on the outcome of that valuation, the preliminary purchase price allocation could change.
 
The unaudited combined condensed pro forma balance sheet as of June 30, 2005 is based on the individual balance sheets of ATN and Commnet and prepared as if the acquisition of Commnet had occurred on June 30, 2005. The unaudited combined condensed pro forma statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the six months ended June 30, 2005, were prepared as if the acquisition of Commnet had occurred on January 1, 2004.
 
The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that ATN believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be read in conjunction with ATN's historical consolidated financial statements as previously filed on ATN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, filed with the Commission on March 31, 2005 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended June 30, 2005, filed with the Commission on August 15, 2005. In addition, this unaudited combined condensed pro forma information should be read in conjunction with the historical condensed consolidated financial statements of Commnet included within this Amendment to Current Report on Form 8-K/A.
 
These unaudited combined condensed pro forma financial statements are prepared for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of future results or of actual results that would have been achieved had the acquisition of Commnet been consummated as of January 1, 2004 for the unaudited combined condensed pro forma statements of operations and as of June 30, 2005 for the unaudited combined condensed pro forma balance sheet. The pro forma financial statements do not give effect to any cost savings or incremental costs that may result from the integration of ATN and Commnet.
 
 
 
 
 
 
NOTE 1- BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 and for the six months ended June 30, 2005 give effect to the acquisition of Commnet by ATN as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2004. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet as of June 30, 2005 gives effect to the above-mentioned acquisition as if it had occurred on June 30, 2005.
 
The unaudited combined condensed pro forma financial information has been prepared on the same basis as ATN's audited financial statements. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their fair value and consolidated into the net assets of ATN.
 
A summary of the preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisition as if the purchase had occurred on June 30, 2005 is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Based upon the purchase price allocation, the total purchase price exceeded the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed when adjusted to fair market value and resulted in goodwill in the pro forma combined condensed financial information of approximately $23.2 million. The licenses issued to Commnet by the Federal Communications Commission were valued at $10.9 million and were determined to have an indefinite useful life.
 
Investments in unconsolidated entities of $3.6 million represents Commnet's 35.00% ownership of MoCelCo, LLC, a 36.63% ownership of Commnet of Florida, LLC and a 33.33% ownership in Tennessee Cellular Telephone Company, LLC which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
 
The note receivable of $3.2 million represents a promissory note from Commnet of Florida, LLC, and is secured by a first lien on all of the assets of Commnet of Florida, LLC. Per the Commnet merger agreement, the Company is required to purchase an additional 12.375% interest in Commnet of Florida, LLC for $1.5 million in July 2006.
 
Minority interests represent the minority shareholders' interest in Commnet's majority owned subsidiaries as well as a minority shareholder's 5% interest in Commnet Wireless, LLC and Subsidiaries.

On February 10, 2006, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN"), completed the acquisition of SoVerNet, Inc. In connection with the acquisition, ATN acquired all of the outstanding common stock of SoVerNet, Inc. for approximately $12.7 million, including the repayment of approximately $1.4 million in SoVerNet debt and the payment of transaction expenses. On February 13, 2006, ATN issued a press release announcing the merger, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
The merger was subject to regulatory approval by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") as well as the State of Vermont Public Service Board ("VPSB"). The FCC domestic and international 214 applications were put on public notice by the FCC on January 10, 2006 and January 27, 2006, respectively, and the VPSB granted its consent to the merger on February 2, 2006.

Salem, MA (February 13, 2006)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN") (Amex: ANK), a communications services holding company, today announced it has completed the acquisition of SoVerNet, Inc. in a cash transaction valued at approximately $12.7 million, including the repayment of approximately $1.4 million in SoVerNet debt.
 
SoVerNet will become a subsidiary of ATN and will continue to operate under the SoVerNet name from its primary offices in Bellows Falls and Burlington, Vermont. SoVerNet is a facilities-based provider of communications services to business and residential customers in Vermont, including bundled voice and high-speed internet access, as well as traditional dial-up internet services.
 
ATN funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings on its existing credit facility. Management expects the transaction will be modestly accretive to ATN's net income and operating cash flows in the second quarter of 2006 subject to the final allocation of the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets. According to preliminary un-audited information provided to ATN, SoVerNet generated total revenues of approximately $13.0 million and pre-tax profit of approximately $2.4 million before merger related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005.
In conjunction with the acquisition, ATN also announced that Richard Kendall has been named President and Chief Executive Officer of SoVerNet, effectively immediately. Kendall takes over for Thomas Lyons, SoVerNet's former President, and J. Barton "Tony" Elliott, SoVerNet's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, both of whom were major shareholders. Tom Lyons will continue as a consultant to the company and is expected to serve on its management board. Kendall, a Maine native, most recently served as Executive Vice President of Sales at Lightship Telecom, a New Hampshire-based regional CLEC (competitive local exchange carrier) with operations across much of New England, including Vermont, that was acquired by another operator in 2005. Prior to Lightship, he was Senior Vice President of Sales at Network Plus, a Massachusetts-based CLEC with operations in nine states. ATN said no other management changes at SoVerNet are contemplated.
 
"We are very pleased to complete the acquisition of SoVerNet," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of ATN. "The company operates high quality network facilities and provides outstanding service to its customers. We do not expect any major changes in its business focus, but we will look to enhance and expand upon its current service offerings and strong reputation for customer satisfaction." Prior added: "As previously noted, all the employees of SoVerNet have done a great job of building the company over the years and have positioned it well for future growth and profitability. Rich Kendall will fit in nicely with our mutual desire to take SoVerNet to the next level."
 
Founded in 1995, SoVerNet has approximately 75 employees, all based in Vermont, and its switches and transport facilities cover most of the State's population base. In 2005, SoVerNet completed a new fiber optic network backbone to connect its markets and allow it to expand its offerings of high-speed data services.
 
Separately, ATN also announced today that its Commnet Wireless subsidiary recently completed two acquisitions of wireless roaming operations located in Northeast Missouri and Central Arizona. Commnet acquired the 65% of MoCelCo, LLC that it did not previously own and all the assets of a privately held network in Gila County, Arizona that it previously managed. The two acquisitions consist of a cellular license, a PCS license and 22 GSM cell sites. Both of the acquired networks border existing Commnet markets and are expected to generate an additional $4 million of revenues for Commnet in 2006. The Commnet acquisitions were funded with cash on hand and borrowings on ATN's revolving credit facility.
 
Immediately following the funding of the acquisition of SoVerNet and the transactions by Commnet, ATN estimates it had consolidated cash on hand and long-term debt of approximately $28 million and $70 million, respectively.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Salem, MA (March 7, 2006)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN") (Amex: ANK), a communications services holding company, today reported earnings of $2.9 million, or $0.58 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, as compared to earnings of $2.0 million, or $0.39 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $0.9 million or 45%.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2005, earnings were $13.6 million, or $2.73 per share ($2.72 per diluted share), as compared to $12.1 million, or $2.41 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of $1.5 million or 12%.
 
Excluding the impact of a $2.1 million reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 described below, earnings for the fourth quarter would have been $5.0 million or $1.01 per share, and $15.7 million or $3.15 per share for the full year 2005.
 
As was previously announced, the Company completed its acquisition of 95% of Commnet Wireless LLC, a U.S. rural wireless network operator, on September 15, 2005 and acquired 96% of SoVerNet, Inc.,
a Vermont data and telephone services provider in February 2006.  Commnet's results since the date of acquisition are reflected in the 2005 operating results and were a major factor in the increase in revenue and operating income.  The Commnet acquisition was also accretive to net income for the fourth quarter and the year.  The acquisition of SoVerNet is not recorded as part of the periods being reported today.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recorded a $2.1 million reserve to non-operating incomeagainst its investment in Bridge International Communications, Inc., a managed network services company.  During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company recorded a $3.4 million impairment charge to non-operating income stemming from the write-down of certain assets at its Choice Communications subsidiary and the curtailment of its Atlantic TeleCenter call center business, offset in part by a non-cash foreign exchange gain of approximately $1 million as a result of the decline in the value of the Guyana dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar.  However, earnings and operating income for the year ended December 31, 2004 were also positively impacted by approximately $1.7million ($0.6 million in the fourth quarter) of net settlements of past due amounts owed to GT&T by large international carriers.
 
Wireless Revenue.
  Wireless revenue more than tripled during the fourth quarter of 2005 to $11.8 million from $3.7 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2005, wireless revenue increased $11.9 million, or 84%, to $26.0 million from $14.1 million.  A substantial portion of the increase for both the quarter and the year reflects the addition of Commnet.  Commnet generated $7.4 million of wireless revenue during the fourth quarter and contributed a total of $8.9 million to annual wireless revenue from the date of acquisition. Excluding Commnet, the increase in wireless revenue for both the quarter and the year was primarily attributable to an increase in wireless revenue at GT&T generated by the continued growth of its wireless subscriber base.  GT&T's wireless subscribers increased from 151,000 at December 31, 2004 to 228,000 at the end of 2005.  Over 100,000 of GT&T's cellular subscribers as of December 31, 2005 are GSM subscribers.
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
  Local telephone and data revenue totaled $7.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, a 14% increase from revenue of $6.5 millionfor the quarter ended December 31, 2004.  For the year ended December 31, 2005, local telephone and data revenue increased to $27.9 million from $25.6 million during 2004, an increase of $2.3 million, or 9%.  The increase primarily reflects growth at Choice Communications.  Choice continued to experience strong growth in its wireless broadband subscribers, offset in part by the attrition of its dial-up internet subscriber base. The growth in Choice's broadband revenue reflects the increased popularity of ClearChoice, its wireless broadband service launched in July 2005.
International Long Distance Revenue.
  International long distance revenue was $11.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, a decline of 7% compared to revenue of $12.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2004.   For the year ended December 31, 2005, international long distance revenue was $45.4 million as compared to $46.9 million, a decrease of $1.5 million or 3%.  However, revenue for the 2004 fiscal year and fourth quarter included previously disclosed amounts of $1.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively, received as settlement of past due amounts owed to GT&T by several large international carriers.    Excluding those amounts received in settlement for prior periods, international long distance revenue would have been essentially flat for the 2005 periods when compared to 2004 despite the expansion of GT&T's access lines and cellular subscribers. Management believes that this stems from the negative impact of various forms of bypass and a lower average price per minute on terminated traffic.  In addition to the increase in cellular subscribers noted above, GT&T's access lines increased to 113,000 from 103,000 as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, an increase of 10%, as management continued to bring new areas into service.
 
Operating Expenses.
  Operating expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 increased by $6.0 million, or 43%, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2004.  For the year ended December 31, 2005, operating expenses increased to $65.3 million from $54.7 million, an increase of $10.6 million or 19.4%.  A substantial portion of the quarterly and annual increases in operating expenses is attributable to the acquisition of Commnet, which increased consolidated operating expenses by $5.5 million and $6.5 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005, respectively.
 
Termination and access fees, which include long distance expenses and bandwidth and circuit costs, increased to $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2005 from $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2004.  Of this $3.5 million expense, $3.0 million relates to Commnet.  Outside of Commnet, the reduction in these expenses is due primarily to cost reductions at GT&T and Choice.  For the year ended December 31, 2005, termination and access fees increased to $7.9 million from $5.6 million, largely due to the same factors.  The increases in both the quarterly and annual engineering and operations expenses are primarily the result of increased costs associated with operating a larger network at GT&T, as well as higher cellular license fees and fuel and power costs.
 
Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $0.1 million or 8% for the 2005 quarter and $1.4 million or 27% for the year, primarily reflecting more aggressive marketing and sales initiatives at GT&T, including promotions, dealer incentives and GSM handset subsidies in connection with head-on
competition for GSM market share in Guyana.  Both GT&T and its main competitor launched GSM services in the fourth quarter of 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense rose by $1.5 million, or 44%, quarter over quarter and $2.4 million, or 16%, year over year, primarily reflecting the addition of Commnet and, to a lesser extent, increases at GT&T and the parent company as a result of new network assets, particularly wireless equipment and sites, placed into service.
 
As a result of the factors noted above, the Company's operating income increased by $2.2 million, or 24%, to $11.3 million for the quarter and $2.5 million, or 7%, to $37.0 million for the year.
 
Other Income and Expenses.
  During 2005, the Company recorded a $2.1 million reserve against its investment in the form of a convertible note in Bridge International Communications, Inc., a VoIP based network service provider. Bridge has had difficulty closing contracts for its primary business line of managed network services. During 2004, the Company recorded a $1.2 million charge relating to the curtailment of its Guyana-based call center business and a $1.6 million impairment charge relating to certain Choice intangible assets.  Interest expense increased during both the quarter and year ending December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings under the Company's new credit facility to finance the acquisition of Commnet in September 2005.  Also included in other income are management fees received from Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC); these fees totaled $1.2 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004.  The year ended December 31, 2004 also includes a foreign exchange gain of approximately $1 million as a result of the decline in the value of the Guyana dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2004.
 
Bermuda Digital Communications.
  Equity in the earnings of BDC was $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 14% over the three months ended December 31, 2004.  Equity in the earnings of BDC also increased by 14% for the full year.  The increase in earnings primarily reflects higher airtime revenues, a 13% increase in subscribers and a similar increase in roaming revenue, offset in part by an increase in operating expense as the organization has expanded to serve a larger subscriber base.  The increased subscriber levels include a number of new data customers using BDC's EV-DO network to obtain high-speed mobile data services.  The growth in data subscribers and revenue in 2005 was tempered by a regulatory action in the fourth quarter that forced BDC to shut down a wireless data modem service launched earlier in the year.  BDC has appealed this decision.
 
Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "Overall, 2005 was a strong year for our primary operating units and for execution of our strategic plan.  We experienced
 
strong growth in operating income and earnings for both the quarter and the year and we were pleased that Commnet was a big part of that growth.  We made great strides strategically with the Commnet acquisition and, in connection with that transaction, we were glad to be able to make better use of our balance sheet and use relatively low cost debt to help grow our revenue and earnings base.   This strategic success was tempered somewhat by the impairment of our investment in Bridge Communications.  But, on the whole, 2005 was a good year for us.  GT&T was able to deliver modest growth in revenue and profits thanks to continued growth in both wireless and wireline subscribers although the growth rate certainly has slowed from previous years.  Commnet had the positive effect on our operating income and earnings that we expected, and we hope to see that impact continue in 2006, joined by our latest acquisition, SoVerNet.  BDC continued its impressive record of subscriber and profit gains in an increasingly competitive marketplace."
 
Prior added:  "We also benefited from our decisions in late 2004 to eliminate some of our smaller, under-performing businesses.  In that respect, we made some significant strides in the fourth quarter towards reducing losses at our Choice unit and we are going to work hard to try to continue that trend in 2006.  While we will face some new challenges in 2006, including execution of our growth plans for Commnet and SoVerNet and the potential for increased competition in the wireless markets of Guyana and Bermuda, we think we have the opportunity to continue the trend of the fourth quarter and generate solid growth in revenue and operating income again this year."

Unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2005.
99.1
                          
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
On September 15, 2005, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN" or the "Company") completed the acquisition of and merger with Commnet Wireless, LLC ("Commnet") pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated July 26, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement"). The Merger Agreement was previously described in a Form 8-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on July 29, 2005 and was filed as an exhibit thereto. In connection with the merger, Commnet is continuing as the surviving entity and owned 95% by ATN and 5% by Brian Schuchman, the Chief Executive Officer of Commnet. ATN paid approximately $59.3 million in consideration for Commnet including certain transaction expenses. ATN also assumed approximately $5.0 million of Commnet's liabilities.
 
Also on September 15, 2005, ATN, as borrower, entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of September 15, 2005 with (a) CoBank, ACB as Administrative Agent, Lead Arranger, and a Lender, and (b) Banco Popular de Puerto Rico as a Lender. The Credit Agreement which was previously described in a Form 8-K on September 21, 2005 and filed as an exhibit thereto, provides for a $50 million non-amortizing term loan (the "Term Loan") which accrues interest at 5.875% as well as a $20 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") which accrues interest at rates as defined within the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement shall terminate, and all amounts outstanding thereunder shall be due and payable in full on, October 31, 2010.
 
To fund the acquisition of Commnet and to repay approximately $10 million in principal amount of outstanding debt at ATN under a previous loan facility, the Company borrowed $50 million under the Term Loan, drew $7 million from the Revolver Facility and used an additional $12.4 million of its own cash. The amounts drawn under the Revolver Facility bear interest at a blended rate of LIBOR plus a margin, or approximately 5.5%.
 
In connection with the Commnet merger agreement, the Company placed $7.4 million of the purchase price in escrow as of September 30, 2005. Of this amount $2.0 million was released to the selling unit holders in November 2005 after successfully meeting certain working capital requirements. The remaining $5.4 million will be released in full in September 2006 assuming no indemnification claims are presented by ATN.
 
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the tangible and intangible assets acquired have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of September 15, 2005. 
 
The unaudited combined condensed pro forma statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, were prepared as if the acquisition of Commnet had occurred on January 1, 2005.
 
The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that ATN believes are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto should be read in conjunction with ATN's historical consolidated financial statements as previously filed on ATN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, filed with the Commission on March 31, 2006. In addition, this unaudited combined condensed pro forma information should be read in conjunction with the historical condensed consolidated financial statements of Commnet included within the Amendment to Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the Commission on November 14, 2005.
 
This unaudited combined condensed pro forma financial statement is prepared for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of future results or of actual results that would have been achieved had the acquisition of Commnet been consummated as of January 1, 2005, The pro forma financial statement does not give effect to any cost savings or incremental costs that may result from the integration of ATN and Commnet.
 
 
NOTE 1- BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 give effect to the acquisition of Commnet by ATN as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2005.
The unaudited combined condensed pro forma financial information has been prepared on the same basis as ATN's audited financial statements. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their fair value and consolidated into the net assets of ATN.
 
A summary of the purchase price allocation for the acquisition as indicated in the audited financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2005 is as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Based upon the purchase price allocation, the total purchase price exceeded the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed when adjusted to fair market value and resulted in goodwill in the pro forma combined condensed financial information of approximately $29.0 million. The licenses issued to Commnet by the Federal Communications Commission were valued at $11.2 million and were determined to have an indefinite useful life.
 
Investments in unconsolidated entities of $2.6 million primarily represents Commnet's 35.0% ownership of MoCelCo, LLC ("MoCelCo") which has historically been accounted for using the equity method of accounting. In January 2006, Commnet acquired the remaining 65.0% interest in MoCelCo for $6.2 million.
 
Per the Commnet merger agreement, in July 2006, the Company is required to purchase an additional 12.375% interest in Commnet of Florida, LLC for $1.5 million. Commnet of Florida is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
 
Minority interests represent minority members' interests in Commnet's majority owned subsidiaries as well as a minority member's 5% interest in Commnet. Assuming a put and call agreement entered into in connection with the Commnet merger agreement is exercised, the Company will be obligated to aquire the remaining 5% ownership interest in Commnet from the minority member between April 15, 2007 and October 15, 2007. The purchase price is contractually set at a fixed multiple to a predefined earnings number based on Commnet's financial results during the 12 month period prior to the exercise of the put and call. Based on Commnet's 2005 financial results, the purchase price, as of December 31, 2005, would be approximatley $4 million. No value was ascribed to the put/call agreement as the exercise price is expected to reflect fair value at the exercise date.
 
As part of the acquisition of Commnet the Company also acquired certain carrier contracts which have remaining contractual lives of one to three years. There is no renewal history of the contracts since none of these contracts have yet to have been subject to renewal. Based upon a discounted cash flow valuation through the current expiration dates of these contracts, the Company has determined that the fair value of these contracts is insignificant and has therefore not allocated any of the purchase price to them.
 
NOTE 2- PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS
 
Adjustments have been made to the unaudited pro forma combined financial information to reflect the following:
To record the effect on interest expense relating to the borrowings of $57.0 million under the Company's new credit facility used to finance the acquisition of Commnet net of the reduction of interest expense relating to the retirement of $10.0 million of existing ATN debt and to reduce interest income for the $12.4 million of cash on hand used to complete the acquisition of Commnet.
(A)
 
 
RemoveCommnet's historical depreciation expense and record depreciation expense for the acquired fixed assets based on the estimate of fair values determined at the time of acquisition. Depreciation expense is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 12 to 72 months.
(B)
  
 
To record income taxes using ATN's effective US corporate tax rate of 40% on Commnet's pre-tax income and the net effect of the above pro forma adjustments in the Statements of Operations.
(C)
  
 
To record minority shareholder's interest in Commnet's earnings.
(D)

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Acquired Businesses Drive 46% Increase in Operating Income
34% Increase in Net Income
and
 
Salem, MA (May 1, 2006)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN") (Amex: ANK) today reported earnings for the quarter ending March 31, 2006. All share and per share amounts reflect the effects of the 5-for-2 split of our common stock, which took place on March 31, 2006. For the quarter ended March 31, 2006 operating income was $11.6 million, an increase of $3.7 million or 46% as compared to operating income of $7.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. For the quarter ended March 31, 2006 earnings were $4.1 million, or $0.33 per share, as compared to earnings of $3.0 million, or $0.24 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, an increase of $1.1 million or 34%.
 
As was previously announced, the Company completed its acquisition of SoVerNet, Inc., a Vermont data and telephone services provider in February 2006. SoVerNet's results since the date of acquisition, along with the results of two previously reported acquisitions by Commnet which were effective January 1, 2006, are reflected in the 2006 operating results. The statement of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 also includes the results of Commnet Wireless, LLC, which was acquired by ATN in September 2005 and consequently is not reflected in the results for the first quarter of 2005.
 
Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., said: "We are happy to have a strong start to 2006. This quarter shows the benefits of some of our key decisions of 2005the decisions
acquire Commnet and SoVerNet, the decision to shut down our Atlantic Tele-Center business and the decisions to implement a restructuring and new service launch at Choice. Our executives and staff worked very hard in 2005 to position this Company for continued growth and we are pleased with the results to date. But there are still some challenges ahead of us. Among those is increasing growth in wireless revenue in Guyana. To this end, we undertook a careful review of our wireless network design and capacity demands in Guyana, and, as a result, committed to further expansion of our GSM network capacity and coverage. We also expect to make additional investments in our U.S.-based rural wireless network and in our Vermont local telephone and data business, as we think both have good opportunities for significant revenue growth."
to
 
the following operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 (unless otherwise indicated, all comparative information is compared against the quarter ended March 31, 2005):
ATN generated
 
Wireless revenue increased by $9.5 million, or 250%, to $13.3 million from $3.8 million. Of this increase, $9.0 million was attributable to the Commnet acquisition. Commnet continues to deploy new GSM and CDMA sites rapidly in existing service markets and is actively pursuing new market opportunities as well. The remaining $500,000 increase in wireless revenue for 2006 was attributable to the growth of GT&T's wireless customer-base, which increased from 166,000 subscribers to 246,000 subscribers. As of March 31, 2006, over 136,000 of GT&T's wireless subscribers were GSM customers. GT&T experienced healthy wireless revenue growth of 14%, but the revenue growth trailed subscriber growth as wireless ARPU (Average Revenue per User) has declined. In management's opinion, the decline in ARPU reflects a number of factors, including: (1) penetration into a lower use demographic, (2) some users maintaining both a TDMA and GSM account which spreads revenue from one user between two subscriber accounts, and (3) lower use in the most recent quarter because of severe network congestion problems in the Guyana's capital city, Georgetown.
Wireless Revenue.
 
Local telephone and data revenue totaled $9.2 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 35%. Of this increase, $2.1 million was attributable to SoVerNet, Inc. which was acquired by ATN in February 2006. Excluding that contribution, local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana and Virgin Islands operations increased by $0.3 million, or 5%. GT&T's increase was attributable to growth in access lines and in its wireless customer-basewhile Choice continued to experience strong growth in its wireless broadband customers. In addition to the increase in wireless subscribers noted above, GT&T's access lines increased from 106,000 to 114,000, an increase of 8%, as management continued to bring new areas into service.
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
International long distance revenue was $11.2 million, a decline of $0.2 million, or 2%. Management believes that this stems in part from the negative impact of a number of cuts to its fiber optic backbone in the first quarter. Management also believes that various forms of bypass in Guyana, principally Internet calling, also contributed to this decline. Other revenue increased as a result of a 23% increase in television subscribers in our Virgin Islands operations.
International Long Distance Revenue and Other Revenue.
 
Operating expenses increased by $8.2 million, or 55%, from $14.8 million to $23.0 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Of the $8.2 million increase, $8.0 million is attributable to the addition of Commnet and SoVerNet, which do not have their operating expenses reflected in our results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. Excluding Commnet and SoVerNet, operating expenses increased slightly due to increased marketing efforts at GT&T and increased overhead costs at the parent company. The increased overhead expenses at the parent include approximately $128,000 in equity compensation expense. These increases were, however, largely offset by the impact of cost reduction measures at Choice.
Operating Expenses.
 
Other income and expenses was a net expense of $388,000 for the quarter, as compared to income of $434,000 a year earlier. The negative change in this item is largely a result of a substantial increase in interest expense and a decline in interest income. The Commnet and SoVerNet acquisitions required the use of cash on hand and borrowing under the Company's credit facility, as did the first quarter acquisitions by Commnet. As of March 31, 2006, the Company's debt to equity ratio was 0.59 to 1 and its net debt to equity ratio was 0.36 to 1. Also included in other income and expenses are management fees received from Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC), which remained relatively consistent.
Other Income (Expense), net.
 
Equity in the earnings of BDC decreased from $0.6 million to $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively. Gross profit from the Bermuda wireless business was relatively flat, but operating income and net income were negatively impacted by higher marketing and legal costs. BDC incurred significant legal expenses relating to the previously disclosed dispute regarding the scope of its license as it relates to data services. A hearing in that matter took place in April 2006 and a decision is expected shortly.

indemnifying parties
(d)           Each Underwriter agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Selling Stockholders, its respective directors, its respective officers who sign the Registration Statement and any person who controls the Company or the Selling Stockholders within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing several indemnity from the Company and Cornelius B. Prior, Jr. to each Underwriter, but only with respect to information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter through you expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information, the Prospectus, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto. If any action or claim shall be brought or asserted against the Company or the Selling Stockholders, any of its respective directors, any of its their respective officers or any such controlling person based on the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Information or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, and in respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter pursuant to this paragraph, such Underwriter shall have the rights and duties given to the Company and Cornelius B. Prior, Jr. by the immediately preceding paragraph (except that if the Company and Cornelius B. Prior, Jr. shall have assumed the defense thereof such Underwriter shall not be required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at such Underwriter's expense), and the Company and the Selling Stockholders, its respective directors,
24
any such officers and any such controlling persons, shall have the rights and duties given to the Underwriters by the immediately preceding paragraph.
(e)           In any event, the Company or the Selling Stockholders will not, without the prior written consent of the Representatives, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which the indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not the Representatives or any person who controls the Representatives within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act is a party to such claim, action, suit or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of all Underwriters and such controlling persons from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.
(f)            If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable or insufficient for any reason whatsoever to an indemnified party in respect of any Damages referred to herein, then an indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Damages (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, respectively, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, from the offering and sale of the Shares or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative and several fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, respectively, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Damages as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative and several benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, respectively, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total gross proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus; that, in the event that the Underwriters shall have purchased any Additional Shares hereunder, any determination of the relative benefits received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders or the Underwriters from the offering of the Shares shall include the gross proceeds (before deducting expenses) received by the Company and the Selling Stockholders, and the underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, from the sale of such Additional Shares, in each case computed on the basis of the respective amounts set forth in the notes to the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault of the Company and the Selling Stockholders, respectively, on the one hand, and the Underwriters on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the Selling Stockholders, on the one hand, or by the Underwriters on the other hand and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
provided
(g)           The Company, the Selling Stockholders and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 was determined by a pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations
25
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the Damages referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of the underwriting commissions received by such underwriter in connection with the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the public. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 8 are several in proportion to the respective numbers of Firm Shares set forth opposite their names in hereto (or such numbers of Firm Shares increased as set forth in Section 10 hereof) and not joint.

A successor to any Underwriter or any person controlling any Underwriter, or to the Company or the Selling Stockholders, its respective directors or officers or any person controlling the Company or the Selling Stockholders, shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements contained in this Section 8.
(i)            It is agreed that any controversy arising out of the operation of the interim reimbursement arrangements set forth in the third paragraph of this Section 8, including the amounts of any requested reimbursement payments and the method of determining such amounts, shall be settled by arbitration conducted pursuant to the Code of Arbitration Procedure of the NASD. Any such arbitration must be commenced by service of a written demand for arbitration or written notice of intention to arbitrate, therein electing the arbitration tribunal. In the event the party demanding arbitration does not make such designation of an arbitration tribunal in such demand or notice, then the party responding to said demand or notice is authorized to do so. Such arbitration would be limited to the operation of the interim reimbursement provisions contained in the third and fifth paragraphs of this Section 8, and would not resolve the ultimate propriety or enforceability of the obligation to reimburse expenses that is created by the provisions of the third paragraph of this Section 8.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
Salem, MA (August 3, 2006)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported earnings for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006. Revenue for the quarter was $37.5 million, an increase of $14.1 million, or 60%, as compared to revenue of $23.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2005.  Earnings were $4.9 million, or $0.40 per basic share ($0.39 per diluted share), as compared to earnings of $3.2 million, or $0.26 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, an increase of $1.7 million, or 53%.
For the six months ended June 30, 2006, revenue was $72.0 million, an increase of $25.9 million, or 56%, as compared to revenue of $46.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2005.  Earnings were $9.0 million, or $0.73 per basic share ($0.72 per diluted share), as compared to earnings of $6.3 million, or $0.50 per basic and diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2005, an increase of $2.7 million, or 43%.
"We are delighted to report another very strong quarter of results for 2006," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.  "While the addition of our recently acquired businesses had a very large impact on the increases over the prior year, we also saw strong organic growth on a consecutive quarter basis, with revenues up 9% and operating income up 4% in just one quarter.   A big part of this performance is our rural wireless business.  We have continued to add coverage and capacity
on both our GSM and CDMA networks throughout the first half of the year and this expansion picked up pace in the second quarter, particularly in the Southwest.  We continue to focus on the bottom line and we were very pleased to see that our new businesses made a sizable contribution to our earnings for the quarter.  Our earnings are up over 20% over the first quarter and 53% over the prior year.
"In other news for the quarter, our Bermuda team was glad to receive a favorable court ruling in its dispute over the scope of its mobile license related to data activities, with the court invalidating a ministry restriction on the sale of our Cellular One affiliate's EV-DO "Bull" wireless modem service.  In Vermont, Sovernet is preparing to launch some new services to the business community in the third quarter and, in Guyana, GT&T engineers have made great strides in adding capacity and coverage to the GSM network. We hope to see the fruits of both efforts over the second half of the year."
Second Quarter 2006 Operating Highlights
As was previously announced, the Company completed its acquisition of Sovernet, Inc., our Vermont telephone and data services provider, in February 2006, and Commnet Wireless, LLC our rural wireless business, in September 2005.  Results for these businesses are reflected only in the 2006 operating results since the date of acquisition and consequently not reflected in the results for the three or six months ended June 30, 2005.  All share and per share amounts reflect the effects of the 5-for-2 split of our common stock, which took place on March 31, 2006.
the following operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 (unless otherwise indicated, all comparative information is compared against the quarter ended June 30, 2005):
ATN generated
   Wireless revenue increased by $9.9 million, or 230%, to $14.2 million from $4.3 million.  Of this increase, $9.5 million was attributable to the addition of Commnet.  Commnet continues to rapidly deploy new GSM and CDMA sites and ended the quarter with 268 base stations in service.  The remaining increase in wireless revenue for 2006 was attributable to the growth of GT&T's wireless customer base, which increased from 191,000 subscribers to 254,000 subscribers, of which 155,000 use our GSM service.
Wireless Revenue.
   Local telephone and data revenue totaled $10.9 million, an increase of $3.9 million, or 56%.  Of this increase, $3.6 million was attributable to the addition of Sovernet.  Excluding that contribution, local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana and Virgin Islands operations increased by $0.3 million, or 4%.  Access lines at GT&T increased from 109,000 to 116,000, an increase of 6%, as we continue to bring new areas into service.
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
   International long distance revenue was $11.5 million during 2006, an increase of $0.3 million, or 3%, from $11.2 million in 2005.   Inbound traffic represented 86% of the total international telephone calls in and out of Guyana.  Other revenue increased as a result of a 16% increase in television subscribers in our Virgin Islands operations.
International Long Distance Revenue and Other Revenue.
   Operating expenses increased by $10.2 million, or 67%, from $15.3 million to $25.5 million for 2005 and 2006, respectively.  Of the $10.2 million increase, $9.8 million is attributable to the addition of Commnet and Sovernet.  Excluding Commnet and Sovernet, operating expenses increased slightly, primarily reflecting increased professional fees and expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance.
Operating Expenses.
   Operating income increased by $3.9 million, or 48%, from $8.1 million to $12.0 million.  This follows a similar year over year increase in the first quarter of 46% and primarily reflects the addition of our rural wireless business.
Operating Income.
   Equity in the earnings from BDC, our Bermuda affiliate, remained relatively unchanged at $0.8 million for both 2006 and 2005.  Wireless subscribers at June 30, 2006 were 21,693 and 21,644 at June 30, 2005.
Bermuda Digital Communications.
As previously announced, in July 2006 Atlantic Tele-Network sold 2.4 million shares of common stock at $19.00 per share in an underwritten public offering, and 1.2 million shares were sold by our Chairman, Cornelius B. Prior, Jr., and related entities.  The net proceeds to the Company were approximately $42.4 million after expenses, and will be used to repay a portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness, to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and/or strategic investments and for general corporate purposes.  The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of the selling stockholders.  After this offering, our Chairman and his related entities hold approximately 40% of the Company's outstanding common stock.
Public Offering of Common Stock.

Revenue for the quarter was $41.3 million, an increase of $16.3 million or 65% as compared to revenue of $25.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.    Earnings were $7.6 million as compared to $4.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, an increase of $3.2 million or 73%.  On a per share basis, earnings increased by 47% to $0.53 per share from $0.36 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2005.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, revenue was $113.4 million, an increase of $42.5 million or 60% as compared to revenue of $70.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2005.    For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, earnings were $16.6 million as compared to $10.7 million for the same period in 2005, an increase of $5.9 million or 55%.  On a per share basis, earnings increased by 47% to $1.26 per share from $0.86 per share in the first nine months of 2005.
Per share data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 were affected by the Company's sale, in the third quarter, of 2.6 million shares of the Company's common stock at $19.00 per share in an underwritten public offering (including 240,000 shares purchased by the underwriters as a part of their over-allotment option), from which the Company received $46.3 million in net proceeds.
 
Share and per share amounts for all periods also reflect the effects of the 5-for-2 split of our common stock, which took place on March 31, 2006.
"This was an excellent quarter across all of our revenue lines," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.  "Each revenue category grew on a consecutive quarter basis, as well as over the corresponding period during the prior year.  Wireless revenue, which now accounts for about 40% of our total revenue, posted the largest increase.  Our U.S rural wireless business enjoyed considerable growth from the ongoing installation of additional GSM and CDMA base stations, overall growth in roaming usage and seasonally high vacation and tourist traffic.  GT&T's GSM subscriber base continues to grow and our network congestion issues in the urban core have been substantially resolved.  Local telephone and data revenue also grew nicely, with all of our markets contributing.  In Guyana, we have picked up the pace of expansion of our high-speed data coverage, and we expect to continue that expansion in coming quarters.  In Vermont, we rolled out new integrated voice and data services for business customers in the third quarter.  In the Virgin Islands, we are still seeing strong demand for our broadband wireless offerings and video revenues are increasing nicely as well.  We also managed to grow international long distance revenue slightly, with more wireline and wireless subscribers contributing to a rise in traffic."
Mr. Prior added, "While we are very happy with our revenue growth, we are particularly pleased to report another sizable increase in earnings and earnings per share.  We also took steps in the third quarter to position the Company for further growthsuccessfully completing an equity offering and attracting coverage from some of our sector's leading research analysts.  Our challenge now is to use that capital and increased attention to our stockholders' advantage."
Third Quarter 2006 Operating Highlights
As was previously announced, the Company completed its acquisition of Sovernet, Inc., our Vermont telephone and data services provider, in February 2006 and Commnet Wireless, LLC, our U.S. rural wireless business, in September 2005.  Results for Sovernet are reflected only in the 2006 operating results since the date of acquisition and consequently not reflected in the results for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2005. The 2005 operating results for Commnet reflect 15 days of operations from the date of acquisition.
The Company generated the following operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 (unless otherwise indicated, all comparative information is compared against the quarter ended September 30, 2005):
 
  Wireless revenue increased by $10.6 million, or 174%, to $16.7 million from $6.1 million, and was primarily attributable to the addition of Commnet's wholesale roaming revenues, and to a lesser extent, growth of our subscriber base in Guyana.  Our Commnet subsidiary continued to deploy new GSM and CDMA base stations rapidly and added 14 new base stations during the quarter. We also decommissioned 21 TDMA/Analog base stations and ended the quarter with a total of 261 base stations, compared to 216 base stations on September 30, 2005.  Our wireless customer base in Guyana increased from 219,000 subscribers to 261,000 subscribers, of which 168,000 use our GSM service as compared to 76,000 GSM subscribers a year ago and 155,000 at the end of June 2006.
Wireless Revenue.
  Local telephone and data revenue increased $5.1 million, or 75%, to $11.9 million from $6.8 million.  Of this increase, $3.8 million was attributable to the addition of Sovernet.  Excluding that contribution, local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana and Virgin Islands operations increased by $1.3 million, or 19%.  Access lines at GT&T increased from approximately 111,000 to 117,000, or 5%, as we continued to bring new areas into service.  Although still small, GT&T's broadband subscriber base has also been increasing rapidly as we expand the DSL-ready lines in the capital.
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $11.8 million during 2006, an increase of $0.4 million, or 4%, from $11.4 million in 2005.   Inbound minutes represented 87% of international traffic for the quarter.  Other revenue increased as a result of a 19% increase in television subscribers in our Virgin Islands operations.
International Long Distance Revenue and Other Revenue.
  Operating expenses increased by $11.4 million, or 75%, from $15.1 million to $26.5 million for 2005 and 2006, respectively.  Of the $11.4 million increase, $9.3 million is attributable to the addition of Commnet and Sovernet.  Excluding Commnet and Sovernet, operating expenses increased $2.1 million.  Of the $2.1 million, $1.5 million is attributable to increased sales and marketing efforts and increased network costs of GT&T associated with the additional access lines and subscribers as well as the expansion of our high-speed data network.  The balance of the increase in operating expenses is predominantly a result of increased professional fees and expenses associated with the Company's requirement to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2006, and additional overhead costs to support our growth.
Operating Expenses.
  Operating income increased by $5.0 million, or 51%, from $9.9 million to $14.9 million.  This follows a similar year over year increase in the first and second quarters of 46% and 49%, respectively, and primarily reflects the addition of our rural wireless business.
Operating Income.
 
  Equity in the earnings from BDC, our Bermuda affiliate, declined from $0.9 million for 2005 to $0.7 million for 2006. This decline was due to increased competition for our smaller pre-paid subscriber base as well as increased marketing and handset expenses to deal with competitive developments.  Wireless subscribers were 22,455 and 22,603 at September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005, respectively.

Revenue increases 52% to $155.4 million
                 
Operating Income increases 41% to $52.3 million

Earnings Per Share increase 56% to $1.70
                 
Strong contributions to year-over-year results from acquired businesses
Salem, MA (March 1, 2007)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported earnings for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, revenue was $155.4 million, an increase of $53.1 million or 52% as compared to revenue of $102.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005.    For the year ended December 31, 2006, earnings were $23.2 million as compared to $13.6 million for the same period in 2005, an increase of $9.6 million or 71%.  On a per share basis, earnings increased by 56% to $1.70 per share from $1.09 per share for the year ended December 31, 2005.
Revenue for the quarter was $42.0 million, an increase of $10.6 million or 34% as compared to revenue of $31.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2005.  Earnings were $6.6 million as compared to $2.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $3.7 million or 128%.  On a per share basis, earnings increased by 87% to $0.43 per share from $0.23 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2005.  Excluding the impact of a $2.1 million reserve taken in the fourth quarter of 2005,
 
earnings for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006, increased $1.6 million and $7.5 million, respectively, or 32% and 48%, respectively.
Per share data for the three months and year ended December 31, 2006 were affected by the Company's sale in the third quarter of 2.6 million shares of the Company's common stock at $19.00 per share in an underwritten public offering, from which the Company received $46.3 million in net proceeds.
Share and per share amounts for all periods also reflect the effects of the 5-for-2 split of the Company's common stock, which took place on March 31, 2006.
"Our main objective for the year was to develop new sources of revenue and growth without negatively impacting earnings.  Thus far, we have exceeded our goals.  This announcement of our full year results for 2006 concludes a very satisfying year" said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.  "Our recently added rural wireless business (Commnet) and New England telephone, data and service provider (Sovernet) both had a strong year.  In particular, the team at Commnet completed an ambitious expansion of our rural wireless network in the Southwest, while continuing to grow multiple sources of revenue from core voice roaming services for major US carriers, to data roaming and roaming for international carriers.  And, we are pleased as well that most of our pre-existing businesses were able to deliver very respectable results for the year.  In Guyana, GT&T managed to grow revenues, operating income and profits despite an increase in cellular competition.   In 2006, we extended coverage and increased the capacity of our GSM network in Guyana and extended the wireline network to new areas as well.  Choice Communications managed to continue to grow revenue and reduce operating losses, reaching our goal of self-funding all cash operating expenses by year-end."
Mr. Prior added, "Looking ahead, we expect to invest significant additional capital in our U.S. businesses which we believe have attractive opportunities to expand the reach of their networks and add new services. Our main challenge in 2007 appears to be greater competition in Guyana, where the existing nationwide wireless competitor was acquired in late 2006 by a large, aggressive, regional operator.  The increased competition is likely to put pressure on our wireless operating margins and market share in Guyana.  Overall, we expect to grow consolidated earnings in 2007, but do not think the organic growth will be as strong as in 2006."
Fourth Quarter 2006 Operating Highlights
As was previously announced, the Company completed the acquisitions of Sovernet, Inc., a Vermont telephone and data services provider, in February 2006 and Commnet Wireless, LLC, a U.S. rural wireless business, in September 2005.  The Company's results reflect Sovernet only since the date of
 
acquisition and consequently Sovernet is not reflected in the Company's results for the three months or twelve months ended December 31, 2005.  The Company's results for the year ended December 31, 2005 reflect Commnet only from the date of its acquisition in September 2005.
The Company generated the following operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 (unless otherwise indicated, all comparative information is compared against the quarter ended December 31, 2005):
  Wireless revenue increased by $5.9 million, or 50%, to $17.7 million from $11.8 million.  This increase was attributable to the continued expansion of our rural wireless network, along with growth in minutes of use and increases in data and international roaming revenue. Our Commnet subsidiary ended the quarter with a total of 287 base stations, compared to 233 on December 31, 2005.  In addition, the increase in wireless revenue also reflects growth of our subscriber base in Guyana.  Our wireless customer base in Guyana increased from 228,000 subscribers to 269,000 subscribers, of which 207,000 use GSM service as compared to 102,000 GSM subscribers a year ago and 175,000 at the end of September 2006.
Wireless Revenue
  Local telephone and data revenue increased $3.8 million, or 51%, to $11.2 million from $7.4 million.  Of this increase, $3.6 million was attributable to the addition of Sovernet.  Excluding that contribution, local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana and Virgin Islands operations increased by $0.2 million, or 3%.  Access lines at GT&T increased from approximately 113,000 to 121,000, or 7%, as we continued to extend the wireline infrastructure to additional communities.  In the Virgin Islands, our broadband wireless subscriber base grew by more than 146% over the year, contributing to the increase in revenues.
Local Telephone and Data Revenue
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $12.2 million during 2006, an increase of $0.8 million, or 7%, from $11.4 million in 2005.  Inbound minutes represented 86% of international traffic for the quarter.  Other revenue increased primarily as a result of a 16% increase in television subscribers in our Virgin Islands operations.
International Long Distance Revenue and Other Revenue
  Operating expenses increased by $8.1 million, or 40%, from $20.1 million to $28.2 million for 2005 and 2006, respectively.  Of the $8.1 million increase, $3.0 million is attributable to the addition of Sovernet.  Excluding Sovernet, operating expenses increased $5.1 million.  Of the $5.1 million, $1.7 million is attributable to increased sales and marketing efforts at GT&T to encourage our TDMA subscribers to convert to GSM handsets and to re-position ourselves against our changing competition.  A further $1.8 million is related to increased engineering and operations costs associated
Operating Expenses
 
with expanding our networks and an increase in termination and access fees from year over year traffic growth at both GT&T and Commnet.  The balance of the increase in operating expenses is predominantly a result of increased depreciation and amortization expense and additional overhead costs to support our growth.
  Operating income increased by $2.5 million, or 22%, from $11.3 million to $13.8 million.  Of the $2.5 million increase, $0.6 million is attributable to the addition of Sovernet. The balance primarily reflects the growth in our rural wireless and Virgin Islands businesses.
Operating Income
Bermuda Digital Communications
  Equity in the earnings from BDC, our Bermuda affiliate, declined from $0.6 million for 2005 to $0.5 million for 2006. This decline was due to a decrease in revenue and increased marketing and handset expenses to maintain our share of a maturing market.  Wireless subscribers were down slightly from December 31, 2005, although we maintained our position as the largest of the three competitive cellular providers in Bermuda.

NEWS RELEASE
 
                 
Net earnings increase 68% to $6.9 million
                 
Revenue increases 26% to $43.5 million
Salem, MA (May 3, 2007)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.  For the three months ended March 31, 2007, revenue was $43.5 million, an increase of $9.0 million or 26% as compared to revenue of $34.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2006.  For the three months ended March 31, 2007, net earnings were $6.9 million as compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2006, an increase of $2.8 million or 68%.
On a per share basis, net earnings increased by 36% to $0.45 per diluted share (on 15.3 million shares) from $0.33 per diluted share (on 12.5 million shares) for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. Per share data for the three months ended March 31, 2007 were affected primarily by the Company's sale of 2.6 million shares of common stock in the third quarter of 2006.  Share and per share amounts for all periods also reflect the effects of the 5-for-2 split of common stock, which took place on March 31, 2006.
"All in all, it was a good start to the year." said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. "Revenue from our expanding wireless operations continues to be the main driver of our growth, but our other revenue lines also showed healthy increases for the quarter.  Local telephone and data revenues benefited from a full quarter of Sovernet's operating results, from slow but steady
 
growth in access lines in Guyana and from strong demand for our wireless broadband services in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  International long distance revenues, which are generated primarily by calls terminating on our wireless and wireline networks in Guyana, grew nicely after many flat quarters, helped in part by Guyana's hosting of the Cricket World Cup matches in late March and the Rio Group Summit in late February.
For wireless revenue, the major factors driving growth were similar to previous periods:  network expansion and traffic growth in the rural United States and network expansion and subscriber growth in Guyana.  Commnet's network expansion over the past year has been concentrated in the rural Southwest, and, in addition to the growth in revenue, we have seen increased operating efficiencies in the region positively impact our operating margins.  In Guyana, we were especially pleased that our team was able to continue increasing subscribers in the face of a more aggressive competitor.  This subscriber growth did, however, come at a cost.  We spent nearly three times as much on sales and marketing in Guyana than a year earlier, much of it on handset promotions.  While we are unlikely to continue that level of spending indefinitely, we believe that it is in GT&T's long-term interests to continue to be aggressive in its marketing activities."
First Quarter 2007 Operating Highlights
As was previously announced, the Company completed the acquisition of Sovernet, Inc., a Vermont telephone and data services provider, in February 2006.  The Company's results for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 reflect Sovernet only since the date of acquisition.
The Company generated the following operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 (unless otherwise indicated, all information is compared against the quarter ended March 31, 2006):
  Wireless revenue increased by $4.9 million, or 37%, to $18.2 million from $13.3 million.  More than half of this increase was attributable to the continued expansion of our rural wireless network, along with growth in minutes of use and increases in data and international roaming revenue. We ended the quarter with a total of 229 GSM and CDMA base stations in our U.S. network, compared to 154 on March 31, 2006.  Our retail wireless business in Guyana generated the balance of the increase in wireless revenue.  Wireless revenue in Guyana increased by approximately $2.0 million, reflecting the growth of our wireless customer base from 246,000 subscribers to 310,000 subscribers. Of this number, approximately 262,000 use GSM service as compared to 136,000 GSM subscribers a year ago and 215,000 at the end of December 2006.
Wireless Revenue

  Local telephone and data revenue increased $2.3 million, or  25%, to $11.5 million from $9.2 million.  Of this increase, $1.5 million was attributable to the addition of Sovernet, which was acquired on February 10, 2006.  Excluding that contribution, local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana and Virgin Islands operations increased by $0.8 million, or 11%.  Access lines at GT&T increased from approximately 114,000 to 123,000, or 8%.  In the Virgin Islands, our broadband wireless subscriber base doubled, contributing almost half of the remaining increase in revenues.
Local Telephone and Data Revenue
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $12.9 million during the first quarter, an increase of $1.7 million, or 15%, from $11.2 million in 2006.  This increase resulted from a substantial growth in wireless subscribers within Guyana (for both GT&T and its competitor, which uses GT&T's international network) and certain non-recurring events during the quarter such as Guyana's hosting of Cricket World Cup matches and the Rio Group Summit helped drive traffic volumes to unexpected levels. Inbound minutes represented 87% of international traffic for the quarter.  Other revenue increased primarily as a result of an 11% increase in television subscribers in our Virgin Islands operations and as a result of price increases for most of our television packages.
International Long Distance Revenue and Other Revenue
  Operating expenses increased by $7.2 million, or 31%, from $23.0 million to $30.2 million for the first quarter 2006 and 2007, respectively.  Of this increase, $3.0 million is attributable to increased sales and marketing efforts at GT&T, including wireless handset promotions, advertising and sales commissions. A further $1.5 million of this increase is related to increased termination and access fees as well as engineering and operations costs at Commnet and GT&T as a result of expanding our wireless networks in the United States and Guyana, and increased year over year traffic growth.  The balance of the increase in operating expenses is predominantly a result of increased depreciation and amortization expense, additional overhead costs to support our growth and the impact of a full quarter of operating expenses at Sovernet.
Operating Expenses
  Operating income increased by $1.7 million, or 15%, from $11.6 million to $13.3 million.  The increase primarily reflects the growth in our rural wireless and Virgin Islands businesses.
Operating Income
Bermuda Digital Communications
  Equity in the earnings from BDC, our Bermuda affiliate, stayed level at $0.5 million for the first quarter 2006 and 2007.  Wireless subscribers were down slightly from December 31, 2006, although we maintained our position as the largest of the three competitive cellular providers in Bermuda and managed to increase post-paid subscribers since the end of 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
                 
Net income increases 84% to $9.0 million (63% excluding  one-time items)
                 
Operating income increases 25% to $15.0 million
                 
Revenue increases 18% to $44.2 million
Salem, MA (July 30, 2007)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007.  For the quarter, revenue was $44.2 million, an increase of $6.7 million or 18% as compared to revenue of $37.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2006.  Net income was $9.0 million for the quarter as compared to $4.9 million for the same period in 2006, an increase of $4.1 million or 84%.
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, revenue was $87.8 million, an increase of $15.8 million or 22% as compared to revenue of $72.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2006.  Net income was $15.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007, as compared to $9.0 million for the same period in 2006, an increase of $6.9 million or 77%.
Other income for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2007 includes a gain of $1.0 million received for the disposition of certain assets, and $1.25 million received by Commnet in a license settlement.  These two one-time items had a combined positive impact of $1.0 million on net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2007.
On a per share basis, net income increased by 51% to $0.59 per diluted share (on 15.3 million shares) from $0.39 per diluted share (on 12.6 million shares) for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 and increased by 44% to $1.04 per diluted share (on 15.3
1
million shares) from $0.72 per diluted share (on 12.5 million shares) for the six months ended June 30, 2006. Per share data for 2007 was affected primarily by the Company's sale of 2.6 million shares of common stock in the third quarter of 2006.
"This was another excellent quarter," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. "We said at the beginning of the year that while we expected to have a good year and to continue to grow, we faced some new challenges.   We are very pleased to continue to report favorable results and credit our operating units for strong execution both operationally and strategically.  Management and staff in Guyana have had to contend with aggressive attempts by its wireless competitor to buy market share  efforts that have been in part successful.  GT&T has dealt with this in a number of ways: by matching some of the excitement generated by customer promotions, by continuing to focus on network quality and coverage and, perhaps most important, by offering customers an alternative to the flash and gimmicks of our competitor, with everyday low pricing across all networks.
"Our rural wireless business in the U.S. faced its own challenges with an ambitious build schedule in some difficult and remote operating areas.  While our network build was behind at the end of the first quarter, we made good progress in the second quarter.  The Commnet team continues to perform at a high level and is quick to take advantage of any opportunity to extend and improve our wholesale services and relationships.  In the U.S. Virgin Islands, management and staff have also done a good job of generating and capitalizing on strong demand for our wireless broadband and high-capacity private line services.  In New England, we are continuing to set the table for the future with accelerating growth of our integrated voice and data services for businesses, while at the same time feeling the not-unexpected pinch of attrition of our dial-up base. In Bermuda, our affiliate continues to be the class of the market with superior network quality, the most advanced technology and an excellent customer experience, although we have suffered from competition in the smaller and less quality-driven pre-paid segment.  We are excited by the recent launch of EV-DO Rev A, which should help BDC increase data subscribers.  More challenges lie ahead for all our businesses, but we expect to continue to produce solid results for the second half of the year."
Second Quarter 2007 Operating Highlights
The following operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 are compared against the same period in 2006 unless otherwise indicated.
  Wireless revenue increased by $4.9 million, or 35%, to $19.1 million from $14.2 million.  Of this increase, $3.4 million was attributable to the on going expansion of our rural wireless network as we continue to deploy new GSM and CDMA base stations, along with growth in minutes of use and increases in data and international roaming revenue. We ended the quarter with a total of 263 GSM and CDMA base stations in our U.S. network, compared to 169 on June 30, 2006.  Wireless revenue in Guyana also increased by $1.5 million.  Our wireless customer base grew from 254,000

subscribers as of June 30, 2006 to 305,000 subscribers as of June 30, 2007.  Although this is down slightly from 310,000 at the end of the first quarter, our GSM subscriber base continued to grow.
  Local telephone and data revenue increased $0.8 million, or 7%, to $11.7 million from $10.9 million.  Most of the increase was generated by our Guyana and Virgin Islands operations, in nearly equal amounts.  In Guyana, access lines at GT&T increased from approximately 116,000 to 124,000, or 7%, while in the Virgin Islands our broadband wireless subscribers almost doubled.  In New England, Sovernet had a minimal increase in total revenue for the period.  Sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services, while at the same time being  negatively impacted by the decline in its dial-up Internet services.
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $12.3 million during the second quarter, an increase of $0.8 million, or 7%, from $11.5 million in 2006.  This increase was primarily driven by continued expansion of our wireline network and increased traffic, particularly wireless roaming traffic, due in part to the International Cricket World Cup matches hosted by Guyana in April.  We also believe that substantial growth in wireless subscribers within Guyana (for both GT&T and its competitor) positively impacted our growth.  However, revenue was negatively impacted by a prolonged outage in May of the international submarine fiber optic cable which Guyana and its neighbors rely on as the primary international connection.  Inbound minutes represented 84% of international traffic for the quarter.  Other revenue increased primarily as a result of a 12% increase in television subscribers in our Virgin Islands operations and, to a lesser extent, as a result of price increases for most of our television packages.
International Long Distance Revenue and Other Revenue.
  Operating expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 15%, from $25.5 million to $29.2 million for the second quarter 2006 and 2007, respectively.  This increase primarily reflects additional sales and marketing expenses incurred by our Guyana wireless business, including wireless handset promotions, advertising and sales commissions.  Engineering and operations expenses and termination and access fees also increased at both our Guyana and United States rural wireless operations as a result of network expansion and increased traffic volumes in these businesses. The previously mentioned international cable cut also led to an increase in these expenses as GT&T re-routed traffic over costly high-capacity satellite links.
Operating Expenses.
Bermuda Digital Communications.
  Equity in the earnings from BDC, our Bermuda affiliate, decreased by $0.2 million to $0.6 million.  Overall, wireless subscribers continued to decrease, although this largely reflects a reduction in our pre-paid wireless base.  Post-paid subscriber churn remains very low by industry standards and BDC was able to increase its post-paid subscriber base on a consecutive quarter basis.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 - 
                 
Net income increases 24% to $9.4 million
 - 
                 
Operating income increases 18% to $17.6 million
 - 
                 
Revenue increases 14% to $47.0 million
 
 
Salem, MA (November 1, 2007)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.  For the quarter, revenue was $47.0 million, an increase of $5.7 million or 14% as compared to revenue of $41.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2006.  Net income was $9.4 million for the quarter as compared to $7.6 million for the same period in 2006, an increase of $1.8 million or 24%.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, revenue was $134.7 million, an increase of $21.3 million or 19% as compared to revenue of $113.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2006.  Net income was $25.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007, as compared to $16.6 million for the same period in 2006, an increase of $8.7 million or 52%.
 
Other income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $2.3 million recorded in the second quarter on the disposition of certain assets and a license settlement. These one-time items, both
received by Commnet, had a combined positive impact after-tax of $1.0 million on net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
 
On a per share basis, net income increased by 15% to $0.61 per diluted share (on 15.3 million shares) from $0.53 per diluted share (on 14.4 million shares) for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 and increased by 32% to $1.66 per diluted share (on 15.3 million shares) from $1.26 per diluted share (on 13.2 million shares) for the nine months ended September 30, 2006. The Company sold 2.6 million shares of common stock through a public offering in the third quarter of 2006.
 
"The third quarter continues the year's trends of solid growth in net income, operating income and revenue," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.  "As with last year, the third quarter also benefited from seasonally higher traffic in our U.S. rural wireless business, Commnet Wireless.  Commnet's growth was also the primary driver of consolidated revenue and profit growth for the quarter.  We have continued to invest in the expansion of our GSM and CDMA networks in remote areas of the Southwest while also benefiting from growth in voice and data traffic volumes at existing sites.  The pending sale of our network in two Midwestern states and our agreement to build a similarly sized network in three other states will likely slow Commnet's growth in the near-term while we undertake our new network builds.
 
"As to our other businesses, GT&T has been able to grow revenue slightly in the face of increased competition for wireless customers and traffic, although the cost of that competitive environment continues to put pressure on profits and margins.  In New England, Sovernet's results remain flat. As we have said in previous periods, achieving overall revenue and profit growth at Sovernet is going to be a challenge as the mix of business continues to shift.  In Bermuda, we are delighted to announce that EV-DO data roaming has finally been launched in recent weeks and we hope that achievement, together with local data subscriber growth, will help return BDC to a modest growth mode in 2008.  Lastly, management and staff, including several important new hires, have continued to improve results in the U.S. Virgin Islands, which has contributed to consolidated profit growth."
 
Third Quarter 2007 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 are compared against the same period in 2006 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue.
  Wireless revenue increased by $4.4 million, or 26%, to $21.5 million from $17.1 million.  Of this increase, $4.2 million was attributable to our domestic rural wireless network and the ongoing deployment of new GSM and CDMA base stations, along with growth in minutes of use and increases in data and international
roaming revenue. We ended the quarter with a total of 287 GSM and CDMA base stations in our U.S. network, compared to 183 on September 30, 2006.  Wireless revenue in Guyana increased by $0.2 million.  Our Guyana wireless customer base grew from 261,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2006 to 330,000 subscribers as of September 30, 2007 and from 305,000 as of June 30, 2007.
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
  Local telephone and data revenue grew to $11.8 million compared to $11.5 million in 2006, an increase of 3%.  While our Guyana operations increased its access lines from 117,000 lines to 127,000 lines, or 9%, GT&T's local telephone and data revenues increased only slightly as a result of decreasing prepaid landline activity.  Sovernet also reported a slight decrease in total revenue as compared to 2006, although the 2006 period benefited from a one-time revenue pickup related to a carrier settlement.  While Sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services, it is being negatively impacted by the decline in its residential data business, particularly its dial-up Internet services.  Our Virgin Islands operations saw an increase in revenue as our high-speed data subscribers in that market increased by 64%, and we also had a strong increase in sales of high-capacity Internet services to businesses and government offices.
 
International Long Distance Revenue and Other Revenue.
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $12.6 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 7%, from $11.8 million in 2006.  This increase was primarily driven by continued expansion of our wireline network and an overall increase in wireless subscribers in Guyana.  Inbound minutes represented 82% of international traffic for the quarter.  Other revenue increased by 11%, primarily as a result of an increase in television subscribers in our Virgin Islands operations.
 
Operating Expenses.
  Operating expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 11%, from $26.5 million to $29.3 million for the third quarter 2006 and 2007, respectively.  This increase primarily reflects additional sales and marketing expenses incurred by our Guyana wireless business, including wireless handset promotions, advertising and sales commissions.  Engineering and operations expenses, termination and access fees and depreciation and amortization expenses also increased at both our Guyana and United States rural wireless operations as a result of network expansion and increased traffic volumes in these businesses.
 
Operating Income.
  Operating income increased by $2.7 million, or 18%, from $14.9 million to $17.6 million in comparison to the third quarter of 2006.  This increase came predominately from wireless revenue growth offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses in Guyana and other operating expenses associated with our network expansions as noted above.
Bermuda Digital Communications.
  Equity in the earnings from BDC, our Bermuda affiliate, decreased slightly due to a decline in voice revenue and an unusual decrease in roaming by our own subscribers in the month of September 2007.  Overall wireless subscribers continued to decrease slightly.
 
Other Events.
 
In September, Commnet, our domestic rural wireless business, entered into an agreement with a national carrier to sell 59 cell sites, along with spectrum licenses, in two Midwestern states for total consideration of approximately $17.0 million.  At the same time, Commnet entered into an agreement with this carrier to purchase and lease spectrum and build a network in rural areas in three states.  This new network is expected to consist of at least 70 sites, and, in return for a long-term roaming agreement with this carrier, Commnet committed to complete the network build by March 31, 2008.  We expect the sale to close in late 2007 or early 2008, however both transactions are subject to regulatory approval and certain other conditions to closing.  The Company expects to record a pre-tax gain when the sale is consummated between $4.0 and $5.0 million in connection with the sale.

Net income increases 54% to $36.2 million
                 
Operating income increases 27% to $67.2 million
                 
Revenue increases 20% to $186.7 million
 
Salem, MA
(February 28, 2008)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007.  For the year, revenue was $186.7 million, an increase of $30.6 million, or 20%, as compared to revenue of $156.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Net income was $36.2 million for the year as compared to $23.5 million for the same period in 2006, an increase of $12.7 million, or 54%.  On a per share basis, net income increased by 37% to $2.36 per diluted share (on 15.3 million shares) from $1.72 per diluted share (on 13.7 million shares) for the year ended December 31, 2006.  Per share data for the year ended December 31, 2006 was affected by the Company's sale of 2.6 million shares of common stock in the third quarter of 2006.
 
Revenue for the quarter was $49.6 million, an increase of $7.4 million, or 18%, as compared to revenue of $42.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2006.  Net income was $10.8 million for the quarter
 
 
 
 
as compared to $6.9 million for the same period in 2006, an increase of $3.9 million, or 57%. On a per share basis, net income increased by 58% to $0.71 per diluted share from $0.45 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2006.
 
Operating income for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $5.0 million on the disposition of assets and a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $4.4 million.  The gain on disposition of assets was associated with Commnet, our domestic rural wireless business, completing the previously announced sale of 59 cell sites, along with spectrum licenses, in two Midwestern states for total consideration of approximately $17.0 million.  Choice Communications, our provider of fixed wireless broadband data and wireless digital television services in the U.S. Virgin Islands, recorded an impairment charge of $4.4 million related to the wireless digital television component of the business.  This impairment of the television business was driven by minimal subscriber growth over the last few years and the continuing operational and financial challenges facing this part of the business.
 
 "We have delivered another strong quarter of revenue and earnings growth, ending what was also another very successful year for our company" said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. "The year exceeded our expectations mainly because of the better than expected performance of our rural wireless business in the United States and to a lesser extent, the wireless and other services of our integrated operator in Guyana.  In the United States, our Commnet subsidiary was able to continue the rapid expansion of its GSM and CDMA networks in remote areas of the western and southwestern states, while at the same time improving operating efficiencies.  The sale of our network and spectrum in two Midwestern markets was also a good long-term strategic move for our company, although we will miss the revenue and cash flows from those operations in the short-term.
 
 
"Coming into 2007, we thought the main challenge would be intensifying competition in the Guyana wireless market. Our nationwide competitor was acquired by an operator with a history of aggressively entering markets.   Using a mix of promotions, substantial handset subsidies and marketing expenditures, as well as an elaborate public relations campaign, our competitor did indeed acquire a large share of the market.  However, our team in Guyana did a very good job of focusing on delivering value to the customer and will continue to innovate, expand and improve services throughout 2008.  We have also re-commenced active discussions in 2008 with the government of Guyana on the prospect of modifying the exclusivity provisions of our license and re-structuring the telecommunications regulatory scheme to deal with those changes.
 
 
 
 
"In other areas," Mr. Prior added, "2007 saw a major improvement in the operating results of Choice Communications' fixed wireless business in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  However, Choice continues to face its challenges, including a somewhat extraordinary decision by Virgin Island authorities to deny our subsidiary tax benefits granted to our competitors.  In New England, Sovernet continued the expansion of its integrated voice and data services to businesses, expanding its service territory beyond Vermont with a launch of services in western New Hampshire, and has done an exceptional job of controlling costs and improving operating efficiencies.
 
"Looking ahead, we expect organic growth to slow in 2008 and we face continued uncertainties in Guyana.   But we will continue to look for strategic opportunities, as well as ways of maximizing cash flows and returns for our investors."
 
Fourth Quarter 2007 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 are compared against the same period in 2006 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue.
  Wireless revenue increased by $4.7 million, or 26%, to $22.8 million from $18.1 million.  The entire increase was attributable to our U.S. rural wireless business, and its ongoing deployment of new GSM and CDMA base stations, along with growth in minutes of use and increases in data and international roaming revenue. Taking into account the sale of the 59 cell sites noted above, we ended the quarter with a total of 266 GSM and CDMA base stations in our U.S. network, compared to 216 on December 31, 2006.  In Guyana, our wireless revenue declined by $1.0 million due to aggressive competition.  Despite our Guyana wireless customer base growing to 328,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2007 from 269,000 as of December 31, 2006, we experienced a significant decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) which was not completely offset by an increase in average minutes of use (MOU).   While the wireless market in Guyana grew over the year, we faced extremely aggressive tactics by our nation-wide competitor as part of its efforts to buy market share, including substantial handset subsidies and other marketing expenditures.
 
 
 
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
  Local telephone and data revenue grew to $12.5 million compared to $10.9 million in 2006, an increase of 15%.  Our Guyana operations increased their local telephone and data revenue by $1.0 million, or 16%, as access lines increased from 121,000 lines to 132,000 lines, or 9%.  Sovernet reported modest growth and increased its local telephone and data revenue to $3.7 million from $3.6 million.  While Sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services, it is negatively impacted by the decline in its residential data business, particularly its dial-up internet services.  Our Virgin Islands operations saw an increase in revenue as our high-speed data subscribers in that market increased by 48% in 2007, and we also had a strong increase in sales of high-capacity internet services to businesses and government offices.
 
International Long Distance Revenue.
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $13.3 million in 2007, an increase of $1.1 million, or 9%, from $12.2 million in 2006.  This increase was primarily driven by the overall expansion of Guyana's wireline and wireless teledensity, which is the measure of the number of telephones per 100 individuals living within a region.  Inbound minutes represented 85% of international traffic for the quarter.
 
Operating Expenses.
  Excluding the previously mentioned impairment of assets and gain on the sale of assets, operating expenses increased by $2.2 million, or 8%, from $27.7 million to $29.9 million for the fourth quarter 2006 and 2007, respectively.  Much of this increase is made up of additional termination and access fees associated with interconnect charges that GT&T pays to other carriers and overall network expansion and increased traffic volume at Commnet.   Engineering and operations expenses, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses also increased but were somewhat offset by a reduction in sales and marketing expenses in Guyana.  Operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2006 and 2007 also included non-cash stock based compensation expense of $0.2 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
 
Operating Income.
  Operating income increased by $5.8 million, or 40%, from $14.5 million to $20.3 million for the quarter.  This increase came predominately from U.S. wireless revenue growth and the gain on the disposition of assets, offset by the impairment of assets and an increase in termination and access fees in Guyana and other operating expenses associated with our network expansion as noted above.
 
 
 
 
Bermuda Digital Communications.
  Equity in the earnings from BDC, our Bermuda affiliate, decreased slightly due to a decline in subscribers and voice revenue.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
                 
Operating income increases 17% to $15.7 million
                 
Net income increases 14% to $7.9 million
 
 
Salem, MA
(May 5, 2008)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008.  For the three months ended March 31, 2008, revenue was $45.6 million, an increase of $1.7 million, or 4%, as compared to revenue of $43.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2007.  Net income was $7.9 million for the quarter, as compared to $6.9 million for the same period in 2007, an increase of $1.0 million, or 14%.  On a per share basis, net income increased by 13% to $0.51 per diluted share from $0.45 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2007.
 
"We are pleased to continue our string of double-digit earnings increases" said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. "While revenue growth has slowed as expected, our team's relentless focus on profitability and cash flows showed in our 17% and 14% increases in operating income and net income, respectively.  Our main growth engine of 2007, U.S. rural wireless, had a good first quarter, more than making up for the sale of cell sites and spectrum in two very mature markets in December 2007.  Overall growth is coming largely from the addition of new sites in a number of areas in the West and Midwest.  In Guyana, we experienced a reduction to our wireless revenue due to increased competition, the impact of the move to per second billing for wireless calls and the lack of special event-driven revenue we
 
 
 
 
generated in the first quarter of 2007; but, we were able to hold up the bottom line because of reduced handset promotions and other marketing expenses and an increase in local telephone and data revenue.
 
"In New England, the mix of business continues to shift with business access line equivalents growing by more than a 20% annual rate and dial-up and residential lines declining at an annual rate of 16%.  While the effect is relatively flat revenue over the past year, we did see a small improvement in profitability in the first quarter and we think this shift in the mix of revenue increases the long-term value of that business.  Our broadband data business in the U.S. Virgin Islands also continued to show solid subscriber growth heading into 2008. Lastly, as announced last week, we are excited about our expected increase in ownership of our Bermuda affiliate, BDC, which allows us to maximize the benefits of that asset and help the management team there find additional opportunities for growth."
 
First Quarter 2008 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 are compared against the same period in 2007 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue.
  Wireless revenue increased by $1.1 million, or 6%, to $19.8 million from $18.7 million.  Notwithstanding the sale of 59 sites in the fourth quarter of 2007, revenue from our U.S. rural wireless business increased by $2.7 million, or 23%, to $14.5 million from $11.8 million.   This was a result of our ongoing deployment of new GSM and CDMA base stations, which generated growth in minutes of use and increased data and international roaming revenue. We also generated revenue from fees earned for switching traffic on the 59 sites sold, although those fees are expected to end in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with a total of 328 GSM and CDMA base stations in our U.S. network, compared to 229 on March 31, 2007.  In Guyana, our wireless revenue declined by $1.7 million, or 25%, to $5.2 million from $6.9 million.  As we discussed in past quarters, a large regional wireless operator launched its wireless service during the first quarter of 2007 with aggressive marketing campaigns and handset subsidies.  Our decline in revenue in the first quarter of 2008 reflects the continued impact of that competition and the introduction of per second billing in March of 2007 for all wireless calls.  Our Guyana wireless customer base, as a result of the competition, declined to 301,000 subscribers as of March 31, 2008 from 310,000 as of March 31, 2007.
 
 
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
  Local telephone and data revenue grew to $12.2 million compared to $11.1 million in 2007, an increase of $1.1 million, or 10%.  Our Guyana operations increased their local telephone and data revenue by $1.0 million, or 16%, as access lines increased from 123,000 lines to 134,000 lines, or 9%, and interconnect fees increased.  Sovernet reported modest growth and increased its local telephone and data revenue to $3.7 million from $3.6 million.  While Sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services, it is negatively impacted by the decline in its residential data business, particularly its dial-up internet services.  Our Virgin Islands operations saw an increase in revenue as our high-speed data subscribers in that market increased by 38% over the same period in 2007 and we also had a strong increase in sales of high-capacity data services to businesses and government offices.
 
International Long Distance Revenue.
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $12.6 million in 2008, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 5%, from $13.2 million in 2007.  This decrease was primarily a result of certain non-recurring events during the first quarter of 2007, including Guyana's hosting of Cricket World Cup matches and the Rio Group Summit.  Inbound minutes represented 85% of international traffic for the quarter.
 
Operating Expenses.
  Operating expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 2%, from $30.5 million to $30.0 million for the first quarter of 2007 and 2008, respectively. The decrease is a result of a significant reduction in the sales and marketing expenses in Guyana incurred in 2007 in response to the introduction of increased competition.  This reduction is partially offset by additional termination and access fees associated with interconnect charges that GT&T pays to other carriers to terminate calls, and increases in depreciation and amortization expense associated with Commnet's and GT&T's network builds in the last few years. Operating expenses for the first quarter 2007 and 2008 also included non-cash stock based compensation expense of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
 
Operating Income.
  Operating income increased by $2.3 million, or 17%, from $13.4 million to $15.7 million for the quarter.  This increase came predominately from U.S. wireless revenue growth.
 
Bermuda Digital Communications.
  Equity in the earnings from BDC, our Bermuda affiliate, remained fairly consistent for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2008.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2008 BDC had 19,375 subscribers and revenue of $5.3 million.  The previously announced expected increase of our ownership in BDC from 43% to 58% of BDC's capital stock is not reflected in these first quarter results.

(e) On May 15, 2008, the stockholders of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") approved the Company's 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2008 Plan") at the Company's 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company had previously adopted the 2008 Plan, subject to approval by the stockholders. The 2008 Plan replaces the Company's other equity plans under which no further awards will be made.  The Company's Proxy Statement (the "Proxy Statement") for its 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which the Company filed on April 23, 2008 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Schedule 14A, included a summary description of the 2008 Plan, as well as the full text of the 2008 Plan as Appendix A. The following is a brief description of the terms and conditions of the 2008 Plan.
 
The 2008 Plan is a broad-based incentive plan, and all employees, directors and consultants of the Company or any of its affiliates capable of contributing to the successful performance of the Company are eligible to participate. Under the 2008 Plan, the Company may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock equivalents and awards of shares of common stock that are not subject to restrictions or forfeiture. The Company has reserved 1,500,000 shares of its common stock for issuance under the 2008 Plan.
 
The Board has designated the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee") to administer the 2008 Plan. Except as may be limited by the 2008 Plan, the Committee will select participants to receive awards and determine the terms and conditions of each award. The Committee has approved forms of award agreements under the 2008 Plan. No award will be transferable except upon such terms and conditions and to such extent as the Committee determines, provided that no award will be transferable for value and incentive stock options may be transferable only to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The 2008 Plan also provides that the Company may not in any fiscal year grant to any participant options, stock appreciation rights or other awards to which performance goals may apply covering more than 150,000 shares.
 
Upon an equity restructuring or other corporate transaction that affects the common stock such that an adjustment is required in order to preserve the benefits intended to be provided by the 2008 Plan, the Committee will equitably adjust any or all of the number and kind of shares in respect of which awards may be made under the 2008 Plan, the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding awards, the exercise price with respect to any of the foregoing, and the limit on individual grants. In the event of a change in control of the Company, the Committee may act to preserve the participants' rights as the Committee may consider equitable to participants and in the best interests of the Company. Without further approval of the stockholders of the Company, the Committee will not authorize the amendment of any outstanding option or stock appreciation right to reduce the exercise price and no option or stock appreciation right shall be canceled and replaced with an award exercisable for common stock at a lower exercise price. The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the 2008 Plan, subject to any stockholder approval it deems necessary or appropriate.
 
The full text of the 2008 Plan is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.   The forms of award agreements are filed herewith as Exhibits 10.2 through 10.5 and are incorporated herein by reference.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Dated:  May 21, 2008
 
 
*  Filed herewith.

Exhibit 10.2
 
 
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby grants to the Participant named above ("you") the number of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares") of the Company set forth below on the terms of this Notice of Grant of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Agreement (this "Agreement"), subject to your acceptance of this Agreement and the provisions of the Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the "Plan").  The Shares are subject to the restrictions set forth herein and those set forth in the Plan.
 
Date of grant:
 
Number of shares:
 
The Shares will vest and become issuable according to the following schedule (each date, a "scheduled vesting date"):
Vesting: 
 
 
By your signature below, you agree with the Company to the terms of this Agreement.
1.  . The provisions of the Plan are incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement by this reference. Capitalized terms defined in the Plan and used and not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan. The Committee administers the Plan, and its determinations regarding the interpretation and operation of the Plan and this Agreement are final and binding. The Board may in its sole discretion at any time terminate or from time to time modify and amend the Plan as provided therein. You may obtain a copy of the Plan without charge upon request to the Company's Corporate Secretary.
Plan Incorporated by Reference
 
2.  . The Shares will vest, while you are a director of the Company, on the scheduled vesting dates stated in the vesting schedule on the first page of this Agreement, subject to the other terms hereof.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, all unvested Shares shall become 100% vested upon your removal from the Board upon a change in control (as defined by the Committee from time to time).
Vesting
 
3.  .  You are responsible for any income or other tax liability attributable to the Shares. It is a condition to the issuance of Shares under this Agreement that you shall pay to the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, any taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to the Shares no later than the date of the event creating the tax liability. The Company and its Affiliates may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind for your benefit. In the Committee's discretion, the minimum tax obligations required by law to be withheld with respect to the Shares may be paid in whole or in part in shares of Stock, including Shares granted under this Agreement, valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of withholding or delivery.  A holder may make an election in accordance with Section 83(b) of the Code.  Any  Section 83(b) election must be filed with the IRS within 30 days of the grant of the Shares and is the sole responsibility of the holder.
Withholding Taxes
 
4.  . You will forfeit all unvested Shares upon the termination of your service as director for any reason (other than death or disability or upon the occurrence of a change in control). When you forfeit Shares, all of your interest in the Shares will be cancelled.
Termination; Forfeiture
 
5.  . The Company shall not be obligated to issue or deliver any Shares if it determines that the delivery or issuance would violate the terms of the Company's policy regarding insider trading (including as a result of your need to engage in a sale of those shares in order to pay applicable withholding taxes).  The Company shall also not be obligated to issue or deliver any shares of Common Stock unless the Company is satisfied that all requirements of law or any applicable stock exchange in connection therewith (including without limitation the effective registration or exemption of the issuance of such shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and applicable state securities laws) have been or will be complied with, and the Committee may impose any restrictions on your rights as it shall deem necessary or advisable to comply with any such requirements; provided that the Company will issue such shares on the earliest date at which it reasonably anticipates that such issuance will not cause such violation.  You further agree hereby that, as a condition to the issuance of shares of Common Stock covered by the Shares, you will enter into and perform any underwriter's lock-up agreement requested by the Company from time to time in connection with public offerings of the Company's securities.
Compliance with Law; Lock-Up Agreement
 
6.  . Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, you shall have all rights and privileges as a stockholder (including, but not limited to, voting rights) with respect to the Shares, whether or not the Shares have vested, prior to any forfeiture.  Any cash dividends or distributions declared and paid with respect to Shares that are, as of the record date for such dividend, allocated to you pursuant to this Agreement, but not issued prior to the applicable dividend record date will be subject to the same vesting and other restrictions as are applicable to the Shares to which the Award relates.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
(July 31, 2008)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.  For the three months ended June 30, 2008, revenue was $50.4 million, an increase of $5.2 million, or 12%, as compared to revenue of $45.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2007.  Net income was $10.2 million for the quarter, as compared to $9.0 million for the same period in 2007, an increase of $1.2 million, or 13%.  On a per share basis, net income increased by 14% to $0.67 per diluted share from $0.59 per diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2007.  Net income for 2007 was positively impacted by $1.0 million of one-time gains.  Excluding those one-time gains, net income for 2007 would have been $8.0 million and the comparative increase in net income for 2008 would be 28%.
Salem, MA
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, revenue was $96.0 million, an increase of $6.9 million or 8% as compared to revenue of $89.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2007.  Net income was $18.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008, as compared to $15.9 million for the same period in
2007, an increase of $2.2 million or 14%.  On a per share basis, net income increased by 13% to $1.18 per diluted share from $1.04 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2007.
 
Revenue and operating income for the second quarter of 2008 was positively impacted by the previously announced increase in the Company's ownership in Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC) from approximately 43% to 58% of BDC's outstanding stock.  The Company began consolidating the operating results of BDC on May 15, 2008, the effective date of its increase in ownership.
 
"This was a good quarter, with stronger results than we expected," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. "Wireless continues to drive our growth.  Our rapid build-out of new markets in the rural United States more than made up for the two markets sold last year, as we continue to see promising results from the extensive investment we made in new network coverage and capacity.  Our wireless revenue also benefitted from a partial quarter of consolidated results from Bermuda.  The impact of the consolidation of BDC will be even more apparent in the third quarter, and will allow investors a better sense of the health and diversity of our revenue streams.  Bermuda has been a great investment for us in the past and we believe our increase in ownership and its contribution to our consolidated wireless revenue will generate additional value for shareholders.  In Guyana, which we expect will generate approximately 15% of our total wireless revenue next quarter, the competitive environment is still more difficult than we have faced in the past, leading to a decline in wireless revenue in that market.  Another challenge to this quarter was a marked increase in bypass trafficinternational traffic that bypasses our network in Guyana costing us revenue and, because of the methods used, presents a very poor quality experience for callers.  We have taken a variety of steps to counter this development and hope to see improvement in coming quarters.
 
"On the fixed line side of our business, we were pleased to see another quarter of growth.  We increased the access lines in service in Guyana, had strong increases in high-speed data subscribers in the Virgin Islands and Guyana and continued to add business customers in Vermont and New Hampshire."
 
Second Quarter 2008 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 are compared against the same period in 2007 unless otherwise indicated.
  Wireless revenue increased by $4.9 million, or 25%, to $24.8 million from $19.9 million.  Of this increase, our U.S. rural wireless, notwithstanding the sale of 59 sites in the fourth quarter of 2007, saw revenue increase by $4.0 million, or 31%, to $16.9 million from $12.9 million.  An additional $2.9 million was attributable to the consolidation of BDC, which represents operations from May 15, 2008 through June 30, 2008, offset by a $2.0 million decrease in our wireless business in Guyana.   Our U.S. rural wireless growth was a result of the ongoing deployment of new GSM and CDMA base stations, along with switching fees earned on the 59 sold sites, although those fees are expected to continue to decrease rapidly in the third quarter and terminate by the end of the year.  We ended the quarter with a total of 367 GSM and CDMA base stations in our U.S. network, compared to 263 on June 30, 2007.  In Guyana, our wireless revenue decline reflects the continued impact of competition that entered the market in late 2006 and a decline in subscribers from 305,000 as of June 2007 to 277,000 as of June 2008.
Wireless Revenue.
 
  Local telephone and data revenue grew to $12.3 million compared to $11.4 million in 2007, an increase of $0.9 million, or 8%.  Our Guyana operations increased their local telephone and data revenue by $0.7 million, or 11%, from $6.6 million to $7.3 million, as access lines increased from 124,000 lines to 135,000 lines, or 9%, and interconnect fees increased.  Sovernet reported $3.7 million in local telephone and data revenue, consistent with the prior year.  While Sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services, to date this has been almost entirely offset by the decline in its residential data business, particularly its dial-up internet services.  Our Virgin Islands operations saw an increase in revenue attributable to additional sales of high-capacity data services to businesses and government offices and a 30% increase in high-speed data subscribers over the same period in 2007.
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
 
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $12.4 million in 2008, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 3%, from $12.8 million in 2007.  This decrease was partly a result of certain non-recurring events during the second quarter of 2007, including Guyana's hosting of Cricket World Cup matches and the Rio Group Summit, which we believe caused an increase in international traffic during that period.  We also believe that bypass activities increased considerably in the quarter, leading to lost revenue opportunities.  Inbound minutes represented 86% of international traffic for the quarter.
International Long Distance Revenue.
 
  Operating expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 11%, from $29.1 million to $32.4 million for the second quarter of 2007 and 2008, respectively. Of this increase, $2.0 million
Operating Expenses.
represents operating expenses of BDC from May 15, 2008 through June 30, 2008.  In addition, the Company recorded increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with our network expansion in the rural U.S and Guyana.  Such increases, however, were offset by the decrease in marketing expenses in Guyana, which had increased in 2007 in response to new increased competition.  Operating expenses were reduced in 2007 by a $1.0 million gain on the disposition of certain long lived assets.  Operating expenses for the second quarter 2007 and 2008 also included non-cash stock based compensation expense of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively.
 
  Operating income increased by $2.1 million, or 13%, from $16.0 million to $18.1 million for the quarter.  This increase came predominately from U.S. rural wireless revenue growth and the consolidation of the results of the operations of BDC, effective May 15, 2008.  Operating income for 2007 was positively impacted by $1.0 million of one-time gains.  Excluding those one-time gains, operating income for 2007 would have been $15.0 million and the comparative increase in operating income for 2008 would be 21%.
Operating Income.

Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
         
 
On September 10, 2008, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a $150 million credit facility consisting of a $75 million term loan and a $75 million revolving loan (the "Credit Facility").  The Credit Facility is provided pursuant to a credit agreement between the Company, as Borrower, certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries, as Guarantors, CoBank, ACB ("CoBank"), as Administrative Agent, Arranger and Issuing Lender and the Lenders named therein.
 
The Credit Facility replaces the Company's prior credit facility provided pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of August 31, 2007 between the Company and CoBank, as Administrative Agent, Arranger and Issuing Lender and the other Lenders referred to therein (the "Prior Credit Agreement").  The Company received net proceeds of approximately $73.8 million from the new term loan, of which approximately $52.1 million was used to repay the outstanding borrowings, accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment penalties arising under the Prior Credit Agreement, which was terminated.  The Company expects to use the remaining proceeds under the Credit Facility for working capital expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.   The Company currently has no borrowings outstanding under the new revolving loan, which includes a $5 million sublimit for the issuance of standby or trade letters of credit.
 
The term loan has a term of seven years, with a maturity date of September 9, 2015.  The revolving loan has a term of six years, with a maturity date of September 9, 2014.  Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin ranging between 1.25% to 2.00% or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.0% to 0.5%.  The applicable margin is determined based on the ratio of the Company's debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to its four quarter trailing EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement.  The base rate is equal to the higher of either (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, as defined in the credit agreement, or (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%.  The Credit Facility also provides that the Company and any of the lenders may agree to enter into an additional term loan of up to $50 million, subject to certain terms and conditions.
 
All amounts outstanding under the revolving loan will be due and payable upon the earlier of the maturity date or the acceleration of the loan upon an event of default, as described below.  Under the term loan, 1.0% of the amount outstanding will be due and payable each year through 2013, 7.5% of the amount outstanding will be due and payable each year for each of 2014 and 2015 and the remaining balance will be due and payable upon maturity, unless the loan is accelerated upon at event of default.
 
Certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries, including Choice Communications, LLC and the Company's other principal domestic operating subsidiaries, are guarantors of the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility.  In addition, the Company's obligations are secured by (i) a first priority, perfected lien on substantially all the property and assets of the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries, including its principal domestic operating subsidiaries and (ii) a pledge of 100% of the capital stock of certain of the Company's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, in each case, including the Company's principal operating subsidiaries.
 
The Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants by the Company limiting additional debt, liens, guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks and other fundamental changes.  In addition, the Credit Facility contains financial covenants by the Company that (i) impose a maximum ratio of debt less cash and cash equivalents to EBITDA, (ii) require a minimum ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense and (iii) require a minimum ratio of equity to assets.
 
The Credit Facility provides for events of default customary for credit facilities of this type, including but not limited to non payment, misrepresentation, breach of covenants and bankruptcy.  Upon an event of  default, the interest rate on all outstanding obligations will be increased and the administrative agent may accelerate payment of all outstanding loans and may terminate the lenders' commitments.  Upon the occurrence of an event of default relating to insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, the lender commitments will be automatically terminated and the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will become payable immediately.
 
The foregoing description is only a summary of the provisions of the Credit Facility and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the credit agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
On September 10, 2008, the Company issued a press release announcing that it had entered into the Credit Facility.  A copy of the press release is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

Each LIBOR Loan shall be made under any one of the Revolver Facility, the Term Loan Facility, or any Incremental Term Loan Facility, but may not be made under more than one Facility concurrently.  During any period in which any Event of Default is continuing, as the Interest Periods for LIBOR Loans then in effect expire, such Loans shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan and the LIBOR option will not be available to Borrower until all Events of Default are cured or waived. In the event Borrower fails to elect a LIBOR Loan upon any advance hereunder or upon the termination of any Interest Period, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to have such amount constitute a Base Rate Loan.

Guaranty of Secured Obligations by Guarantors.
 
  In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by Guarantors from the extensions of credit hereunder, each Guarantor hereby agrees with Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties as follows:  each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, to Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties of any and all Secured Obligations.  If any or all of the Secured Obligations becomes due and payable hereunder, each Guarantor unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, on order, or demand, together with any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties in collecting any of the Secured Obligations.
(A)
              
The Guaranty.
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Loan Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under Applicable Law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).
 
Each Guarantor's maximum obligations hereunder (the "") in any case or proceeding referred to below (but only in such a case or proceeding) shall not be in excess of:
Maximum Guarantor Liability
 
(i)        in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code on or within two years from the date on which any of the Secured Obligations are incurred, the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under (A)
Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or (B) any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in such case or proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code; or
(ii)       in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code subsequent to two years from the date on which any of the Secured Obligations of such Guarantor are incurred, the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in any such case or proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code;
 
(iii)      in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under any law, statute or regulation other than the Bankruptcy Code relating to dissolution, liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium, readjustment of debt, compromise, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization or similar debtor relief from time to time in effect affecting the rights of creditors generally (collectively, ""), the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under such Other Debtor Relief Law, including, without limitation, any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in any such case or proceeding.  (The substantive state or federal laws under which the possible avoidance or unenforceability of the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) shall be determined in any such case or proceeding shall hereinafter be referred to as the "".)
Other Debtor Relief Law
Avoidance Provisions
 
To the extent set forth above, but only to the extent that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20, or the transfers made by such Guarantor under the Security Documents to which it is a party, would otherwise be subject to avoidance under any Avoidance Provisions if such Guarantor is not deemed to have received valuable consideration, fair value, fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for such transfers or obligations, or if such transfers or obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 would render such Guarantor insolvent, or leave such Guarantor with an unreasonably small capital or unreasonably small assets to conduct its business, or cause such Guarantor to have incurred debts (or to have intended to have incurred debts) beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, in each case as of the time any of the obligations of such Guarantor are deemed to have been incurred and transfers made under such Avoidance Provisions, then such obligations shall be reduced to that amount which, after giving effect thereto, would not cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations), as so reduced, to be subject to avoidance under such Avoidance Provisions.  This paragraph is intended solely to preserve the rights hereunder of Administrative Agent, the Lenders
and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations to the maximum extent that would not cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 to be subject to avoidance under any Avoidance Provisions, and neither such Guarantor nor any other Person shall have any right, defense, offset, or claim under this paragraph as against Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations that would not otherwise be available to such Person under the Avoidance Provisions.
 
Each Guarantor agrees that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Guarantor Liability, without impairing the guaranty or any provision contained herein or affecting the rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder.
 
  Additionally, each of Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all Secured Obligations whether or not due or payable upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Subsection 6.1(F) or (G) and unconditionally promises to pay such Secured Obligations on demand.  Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to the extent that Borrower or any Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer of an interest in any property to Administrative Agent or any Lender, which payment or transfer or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be repaid to Borrower or any Guarantor, the estate of Borrower or any Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.
(B)
          
Bankruptcy.
 
  The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the Secured Obligations whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or impaired by (i) any direction as to application of payment by Borrower or by any other party, or (ii) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Secured Obligations, or (iii) any payment on or reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (iv) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by Borrower or other guarantor, or (v) any payment made to a Secured Party on the Secured Obligations which such Secured Party repays Borrower or another guarantor pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each of Guarantors waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.
(C)
          
Nature of Liability.
 
  The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor or Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other guarantor or Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor or Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.
(D)
         
Independent Obligation.
 
  Each of Guarantors authorizes each Secured Party without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and
(E)
          
Authorization.
without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to (i)  change the terms of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof, with the consent of Borrower, (ii) take and hold security from any other guarantor or any other party for the payment of this guaranty or the Secured Obligations and exchange, enforce waive and release any such security, and apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Administrative Agent and Lenders in their discretion may determine and (iii) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, Borrower or other obligors.

The credit facility consists of a $75 million term loan and a $75 million revolving loan and replaces the Company's existing credit facility.  CoBank, ACB acted as lead arranger in the transaction.
Salem, MA
 
"The new credit facility reflects our strong balance sheet and operating performance over the last few years, and will provide us with even greater financial flexibility in managing our businesses and growth initiatives," said Justin D. Benincasa, Chief Financial Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.
 
The Company used approximately $50 million of the new term loan to repay outstanding borrowings under the Company's prior credit facility, which was terminated.  The Company expects to use the remaining proceeds from the credit facility for working capital expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes.  The Company currently has no borrowings under the new revolving loan.
 
The term loan has a term of seven years, maturing on September 9, 2015.  The revolving loan has a term of six years, maturing on September 9, 2014.  Amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at (a) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus applicable margin ranging from 1.25% to 2.00% or (b) Base rate (prime rate) plus applicable margin ranging from 0% to 0.5%.  As with the prior credit facility, the Company's obligations under the new credit facility are guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries, including its principal domestic operating subsidiaries; and the Company's obligations are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the property and assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries and by a pledge of the capital stock owned by the Company in certain of its foreign and domestic subsidiaries.  The credit facility also provides that the
Company and any of the lenders may agree to enter into an additional term loan of up to $50 million.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
                 
Revenue increases 16% to $55.9 million
                 
Operating income increases 17% to $20.4 million
                 
Earnings per share increases 8% to $0.66
 
Salem, MA
(November 5, 2008)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.  For the three months ended September 30, 2008, revenue was $55.9 million, an increase of $7.8 million, or 16%, as compared to revenue of $48.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2007.  Operating income increased 17% for the quarter to $20.4 million, as compared to $17.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.  Net income was $10.1 million for the quarter, as compared to $9.4 million for the same period in 2007, an increase of $0.7 million, or 7%.
 
On a per share basis, net income increased by 8% to $0.66 per diluted share from $0.61 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2007.  Earnings per share were negatively impacted this quarter by $0.04 as a result of the addition of two early-stage businesses; which include IslandCom Telecommunications, a Turks & Caicos-based wireless company, a controlling interest of which was
 
 
acquired by Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC) in September, and ION, a New York State fiber optic network, in which Sovernet acquired a majority stake of in August.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, revenue was $152.0 million, an increase of $14.8 million or 11% as compared to revenue of $137.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.  Operating income increased 15% for the nine months September 30, 2008 to $54.1 million, as compared to $46.9 million for the same period in 2007.  Net income was $28.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008, as compared to $25.3 million for the same period in 2007, an increase of $2.9 million or 11%.  On a per share basis, net income also increased by 11% to $1.85 per diluted share from $1.66 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.
 
"Our wireless operations accounted for well over half of all revenue in the quarter" said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. "Strong growth in our US wireless operations continued, and this business unit accounted for two-thirds of total wireless revenue.  This growth largely reflects the success of our accelerated build-out program in rural areas of the West and Midwest in the first half of 2008 to meet the needs of our larger carrier customers.  The consolidation of our Bermuda operations, following our ownership increase earlier this year, was also a large component of the year-on-year increase in wireless revenue. In Bermuda, subscriber levels were flat overall, although losses in the smaller pre-paid segment were offset in large part by gains in ARPU from higher-value users with data contracts.  We expect the recent investment in Turks and Caicos by Bermuda to provide a small boost to wireless revenue over the next twelve months; however, the start-up nature of those operations is likely to generate modest losses for at least that period.
 
"On the fixed line side of our business, our Guyana subsidiary helped drive another nice quarter of growth, but we expect to reduce our build-out of local access lines in coming quarters.  We are excited by Sovernet's expansion beyond Vermont and New Hampshire with its investment, alongside a number of rural telephone operators, in a state-wide fiber optic network in New York State.  While we were happy to make these two new investments in the third quarter, they are relatively small and, given the strength of our balance sheet, we continue to look for larger opportunities."
 
Third Quarter 2008 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 are compared against the same period in 2007 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue.
  Wireless revenue increased by $8.3 million, or 38%, to $30.4 million from $22.1 million.  Of this increase, $5.1 million was attributable to the consolidation of BDC, our Bermuda wireless operation, which the Company began consolidating as of May 15, 2008.  In addition, our U.S. rural wireless business saw revenue increase by $3.9 million, or 24%, to $19.9 million from $16.0 million, notwithstanding the sale of 59 sites in the fourth quarter of 2007.  These increases were offset by a $0.7 million decrease in our wireless business in Guyana.   Our U.S. rural wireless business continued to deploy new base stations and ended the quarter with a total of 396 base stations, compared to 286 on September 30, 2007.  In Guyana, our wireless revenue decline reflects the continued impact of competition that entered the market in late 2006 and a decline in subscribers from 330,000 as of September 30, 2007 to 273,000 as of September 30, 2008.
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
  Local telephone and data revenue grew to $12.8 million compared to $11.6 million in 2007, an increase of $1.2 million, or 10%.  Our Guyana operations increased their local telephone and data revenue by $0.7 million, or 10%, from $6.8 million to $7.5 million, as access lines increased from 127,000 lines to 136,000 lines, or 7%, and interconnect fees increased.  In New England, Sovernet recorded $4.1 million in local telephone and data revenue, an increase of $0.4 million over 2007 due largely to the acquisition of ION, an early stage fiber based transport provider, in August 2008.
 
International Long Distance Revenue.
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $11.8 million in 2008, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 11%, from $13.3 million in 2007.  This decrease, we believe, primarily was a result of a considerable increase in illegal bypass activities in the quarter, resulting in lost revenue opportunities.
 
Operating Expenses.
  Operating expenses increased by $4.9 million, or 16%, from $30.7 million to $35.6 million for the third quarter of 2007 and 2008, respectively. Of this increase, $3.9 million represents operating expenses of BDC which the Company began consolidating as of May 15, 2008.  In addition, the Company recorded increased depreciation and amortization expense associated with our network expansion in the rural U.S. and in Guyana.  Such increases, however, were partially offset by a significant decrease in marketing expenses in Guyana, down from historical highs in 2007.  Operating expenses for the third quarter 2007 and 2008 also included non-cash stock based compensation expense of $0.2 million in each quarter.
 
 
Operating Income.
  Operating income increased by $3.0 million, or 17%, from $17.4 million to $20.4 million for the quarter.  This increase came predominately from the consolidation of the results of the operations of BDC, effective May 15, 2008 and U.S. rural wireless revenue growth.

Deferred Compensation Plan
 
("Participants").  Under the Plan, the Company will make annual credits equal to 8% of a Participant's then current base salary to an account on behalf of that Participant.  The Company may make additional credits in its sole discretion.  Credits to such accounts under the Plan will be deemed to be invested in one or more investment funds selected by the Participant.  Credits will be fully vested at all times and Participants will have a nonforfeitable interest in the balance of their respective account.  Benefits under the Plan are payable in cash upon a separation from service or in accordance with a fixed scheduled elected by the Participant.  The Company may amend, modify or terminate the Plan at any time in its sole discretion.  In accordance with the Plan, the Committee has delegated the day to day operational responsibilities under the Plan to the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
On December 5, 2008, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Select Employees (the "Plan").  The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee").  Participants under the Plan will be chosen by the Committee and will be limited to management employees or highly compensated employees, within the meaning of Title I of the
 
The Plan is intended to provide retirement income to certain key executives of the Company and was adopted to offset a reduction in the Company's annual contribution to these executives' accounts under the Company's 401(k) retirement plan.  Prior to 2008, the Company made annual contributions to the 401(k) accounts of each of these executives in an amount equal to 12% of their respective base salary, up to a maximum of  $24,000.  However, following the Company's consolidation in 2008 of the Company's 401(k) plan with the 401(k) plans of Commnet Wireless, LLC and Sovernet, Inc., two of the Company's subsidiaries, the Company's annual contribution to the 401(k) plan accounts of each of these executives was reduced to a maximum of 4% of their respective base salary.  The Plan is intended to be compliant with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and to constitute a non-qualified, unfunded executive benefit plan.
 
On December 5, 2008, the Committee selected Michael Prior, President and Chief Executive Officer, Justin Benincasa, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, William Kreisher, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, Douglas Minster, Vice President and General Counsel, John Audet, Vice President  Financial Analysis and Planning and Andy Fienberg, Chief Accounting Officer to be Participants under the Plan.  Annual credits were made to accounts on behalf of each of these executives in amounts equal to 8% of their respective 2008 base salary.

If the Participant elects the installment form of distributions, each annual installment will be determined by multiplying the then-current balance of the Participant's Annual Account by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the number of years remaining in the payout period and will be treated as a separate payment in accordance with Treasury Regulation 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii).

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
                 
Revenue increases 11% to $207.3 million
                 
Operating income increases 3% to $69.5 million
                 
Net income declines 8% to $34.8 million
 
(March 4, 2009)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.  For the year, revenue was $207.3 million, an increase of $20.6 million, or 11%, as compared to revenue of $186.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Net income was $34.8 million for the year as compared to $37.9 million for the same period in 2007, a decrease of $3.1 million, or 8%.  On a per share basis, net income declined by 8% to $2.28 per diluted share from $2.48 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Salem, MA
 
Revenue for the quarter was $55.4 million, an increase of $5.8 million, or 12%, as compared to revenue of $49.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2007.  Net income was $6.6 million for the quarter as compared to $12.6 million for the same period in 2007, a decrease of $6.0 million, or 48%. On a per share basis, net income declined by 48% to $0.43 per diluted share from $0.82 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 31, 2007.
 
Revenue and operating income for the quarter was positively impacted by the consolidation of our Bermuda operations following the May 2008 increase in our ownership position, as further discussed below.  However, operating income was impacted by losses of approximately $1.0 million from our two previously announced early-stage business acquisitions  IslandCom Telecommunications, a Turks & Caicos-based wireless voice and data company and ION, a New York State fiber optic network, and $1.0 million of costs related to an unsuccessful effort to acquire an entity out of bankruptcy.  Operating income for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2007 includes a pre-tax gain of $5.0 million ($6.0 million for the year) related to asset sales at Commnet, including the sale of 59 base stations, and offset by a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $4.4 million at Choice Communications.
 
"The results for the quarter and the year were mixed" said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. "We are happy with a number of strategic moves we made to position ourselves for continued growth of our businesses. We invested nearly $40 million in acquiring or increasing our stakes in operational businesses, and an estimated additional $40.0 million expanding and upgrading our existing networks.  With a robust balance sheet and belief in our strategy and team, we looked hard for new investment opportunities.  Before the severe market drop in the last third of the year, we found valuations for later-stage and larger businesses to be too high and instead invested in two, small early-stage businesses  the fiber backhaul business in upstate New York and the wireless business in Turks and Caicos  that fit very well with our existing operations.  Although these investments had a negative near-term impact, we expect both to be positive contributors to cash flows in 2010.  We also increased our ownership in our Bermuda wireless operation and extended our US wireless footprint with the acquisition of a wireless network in Nevada.  We believe both of those transactions strengthen us strategically and provide the potential for increased revenues and cash flows in 2009.   Our quest for opportunities also led to a significant increase in legal and related expenses in the fourth quarter with respect to a large transaction we pursued without success.  With our net cash position, large recurring cash flows and the larger debt facility we closed just prior to the collapse of the credit markets, we believe we are well positioned to make further strategic investments, although we will continue to take a long-term view and maintain strict investment parameters in terms of value, strategic fit and risk.
 
"The performance of our existing businesses also contributed to the mixed results for the quarter.  Our rural wireless business continued to grow nicely, albeit at the slower pace we expected after the sale of assets at the end of 2007.  With 473 base stations at the end of the year (a more than 50% annual increase) and a major new market in Nevada, we see opportunities to continue to grow that business in 2009, although rate reductions and overbuilding will have some negative impact.  Our next biggest wireless
business, in Bermuda, was flat on a stand-alone basis, but we believe the imminent launch of a UMTS (3G) network will provide some growth for this business in 2009 and 2010, and, as noted above, we expect BDC's expansion to Turks and Caicos also to add growth.
 
"In Guyana," Mr. Prior added, "the wireless results were disappointing.  While the continued loss of subscribers was mainly composed of low-value subscribers, wireless revenues declined significantly in that market.  We believe we have the better network and offer better value, but we still need to convince more consumers of that.  More importantly in Guyana, 2008 saw a marked increase in international bypass activities.  We have taken additional actions to stem that activity, which not only robs GT&T of revenue and profit but also significantly reduces the government's VAT and income tax collections.  Although governmental authorities have made some effort to assist us, we have yet to see a major reduction in bypass activity.  Lastly, in New England the core business held up well and continued to grow in a tough environment.  We believe that the addition of ION and some new services to customers will provide a boost to results from this market in future periods."
 
Fourth Quarter 2008 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 are compared against the same period in 2007 unless otherwise indicated.
 
  Wireless revenue increased by $7.2 million, or 32%, to $30.0 million from $22.8 million.  The consolidation of our Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC) operations, which began as of May 15, 2008, contributed $6.1 million of the increase. Notwithstanding the sale of 59 base stations at the end of 2007, our U.S. rural wireless business increased revenues by $1.9 million as a result of its ongoing deployment of new base stations along with growth in recurring voice and data traffic. We ended the quarter with a total of 473 base stations in our U.S. network,  the 2008 total includes 46 sites from the acquisition of wireless network assets of CC Communications in Nevada in late December  up from 303 base stations as of December 31, 2007.  This acquisition had a negligible impact on results for the quarter.  In Guyana, our wireless revenue declined by $0.7 million, as increased competition led to a decrease in our wireless customer base to approximately 248,000 subscribers as of December 31, 2008 from 328,000 as of December 31, 2007 and 273,000 as of September 30, 2008.
Wireless Revenue.
 
  Local telephone and data revenue grew to $13.3 million compared to $12.5 million in 2007, an increase of 6%.  Sovernet's local telephone and data revenue increased $0.9
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
million, or 24%, to $4.6 million from $3.7 million in 2007. This increase is mainly due to Sovernet's acquisition of ION. Our Guyana subsidiary saw a slight increase in its local telephone and data revenue as access lines increased from 132,000 lines to 139,000 lines, or 5%, however, these increases were offset by a decrease in data revenue at our Virgin Islands subsidiary.
 
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $11.1 million in 2008, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 17%, from $13.3 million in 2007.  We believe this decrease primarily is a result of a considerable increase in illegal bypass activities in the quarter resulting in lost revenue opportunities, and an overall reduction in call volume into Guyana as an outcome of the current worldwide economic slowdown.
International Long Distance Revenue.
 
  Excluding the net impact from the previously mentioned impairment of assets and gain on the sale of assets in 2007, operating expenses increased by $10.0 million, or 33%, from $29.9 million to $39.9 million for the fourth quarter 2007 and 2008, respectively.  Of this increase, $5.7 million represents operating expenses of BDC which the Company began consolidating as of May 2008, $1.5 million in operating expenses at ION, which was acquired in August 2008, and $1.0 million for unsuccessful acquisition efforts that were previously mentioned. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense at Commnet increased $1.0 million as a result of our network expansion in the rural U.S. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2007 and 2008 included non-cash stock based compensation expense of $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
Operating Expenses.
 
  Operating income declined by $4.8 million, or 24%, from $20.3 million to $15.5 million for the quarter.  This was due in part to the decrease in Guyana's international long distance revenue, as well as the addition of the early stages businesses of ION and IslandCom.
Operating Income.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
                 
Revenue increases 23% to $56.0 million
                 
Operating income increases 7% to $16.8 million
                 
Net income attributable to Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. stockholders increases 12% to $8.8 million
 
Salem, MA
(April 29, 2009)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.  For the three months ended March 31, 2009, revenue was $
56.0
million, an increase of $
10.4
million, or
23
%, as compared to revenue of $45.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2008.  Net income attributable to Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. Stockholders(1) was $
8.8
million for the quarter, as compared to $7.9 million for the same period in 2008, an increase of $
0.9
million, or
11
%.  On a per share basis, net income attributable to Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. stockholders increased by
14
% to $
0.58
per diluted share from $0.51 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2008.
 
Revenue and operating income for the quarter were positively impacted by the consolidation of our Bermuda operations following the May 2008 increase in our ownership position.
 
(1) As a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 160, Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements- an Amendment of ARB No. 51, the financial statement line item that had been entitled "Net income" under the previous reporting method is now entitled "Net income attributable to Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. Stockholders."
 
"We were pleased to continue our revenue growth in the first quarter," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc., "and also to deliver steady operating and net income gains.   The strong, double-digit revenue growth largely reflects the same factors behind our growth in 2008: the expansion of the territory covered and minutes and megabytes served by our US wireless business and our increased ownership of the leading wireless provider in Bermuda.  The benefits of this strong performance and revenue growth were partly offset by the continued decline in our international revenues in Guyana, due to bypass and macro-economic conditions.  That same factor, as well as the addition in the third quarter of 2008 of two earlier stage businesses, also limited the overall growth in operating income and net income for this quarter.
 
"On the positive side in Guyana, we did see a slight pickup in our wireless subscribers in that market, over the end of 2008, after a number of consecutive quarters of significant declines.  Bermuda wireless subscribers also grew modestly in the quarter.  Our local telephone and data revenues also rose because of gains in the US operations, but that increase had little benefit on operating profits because the operations in New York State are still early stage and thus produced operating losses.  As the year progresses," Mr. Prior added, "we do not expect our US wireless operations to grow at quite this rate, but we hope to find a solution to reduce the rate of decline in international revenue."
 
First Quarter 2009 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 are compared against the same period in 2008 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue.
  Wireless revenue increased by $
11.9
million, or
60
%, to $
31.7
million from $19.8 million. Our U.S. rural wireless business increased revenues by $7.1 million, or 49%, to $21.6 million from $14.5 million.   This was a result of our ongoing deployment of new base stations along with growth in recurring voice and data traffic. We ended the quarter with a total of 484 base stations in our U.S. network,  including 46 sites from the acquisition of wireless network assets of CC Communications in Nevada in late December 2008  up from 328 base stations as of March 31, 2008.  The increase in our equity position in, and consolidation of, our Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC) operations, which occurred as of May 15, 2008, contributed $5.2 million of the increase.  In Guyana, our wireless revenue declined by $0.3 million, as increased competition led to a decrease in our wireless customer base to approximately 254,000 subscribers as of March 31, 2009 from 301,000 as of March 31, 2008. The subscriber base, however, increased from 248,000 as of December 31, 2008.
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue.
  Local telephone and data revenue grew to $13.1 million compared to $12.2 million in 2008, an increase of $0.9 million, or 7%.  Sovernet's local telephone and data revenue
increased $0.9 million, or 24%, to $4.6 million from $3.7 million in 2008. This increase is mainly due to Sovernet's acquisition of ION in August 2008. Local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana operations remained at $7.4 million quarter over quarter, while access lines increased from 134,000 lines to 140,000 lines, or 4%.  Data revenue at our Virgin Islands subsidiary remained fairly consistent.
 
International Long Distance Revenue.
  International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, was $10.4 million in 2009, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 17%, from $12.6 million in 2008.  We believe this decrease is a result of a considerable increase in illegal bypass activities in the quarter resulting in lost revenue opportunities, as well as an overall reduction in call volume into Guyana as an outcome of the current worldwide economic slowdown.
 
Operating Expenses.
  Operating expenses increased by $9.2 million, or 31%, from $30.0 million to $39.2 million for the first quarter of 2008 and 2009, respectively. Of this increase, $5.0 million represents operating expenses of BDC which the Company began consolidating as of May 2008.   Our U.S. wireless business also had an increase of $3.6 million in operating expenses as our costs of sales and depreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of our network expansion and associated revenue growth.  Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2008 and 2009 also included non-cash stock based compensation expense of $0.3 million.
 
Operating Income.
  Operating income increased by $1.1 million, or 7%, from $15.7 million to $16.8 million for the quarter.  This increase came predominately from U.S. wireless revenue growth, offset by a decrease in international long distance revenue at our Guyana operations.

Item 1.01
                    
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On June 9, 2009, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless ("Verizon") to acquire wireless assets in certain primarily rural markets in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Ohio and Idaho.    Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, Verizon will cause certain licenses, network assets, tower and other leases and other assets and certain related liabilities to be contributed to a newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary limited liability company, whose membership interests will be acquired by the Company for a purchase price of approximately $200 million (the "Transaction").  Verizon is required to divest these assets under consent decrees it entered into with the Department of Justice related to its purchase of Alltel
Corporation ("Alltel")
earlier this year.
 
ATN expects to fund substantially all of the purchase price with cash-on-hand and borrowings under its existing credit facility.  As of April 30, 2009, ATN had approximately $90 million in cash and cash equivalents, $75 million of available borrowings under its undrawn revolving credit facility, and an additional $50 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender consent, under its term credit facility.
 
The parties have agreed to a variety of customary covenants and agreements, including with respect to confidentiality, cooperation (including with respect to regulatory matters), the conduct of the business to be acquired in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and other restrictions on the operation of such business prior to the consummation of the Transaction, public announcements and similar matters. Consummation of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, (i) the receipt of the United States Department of Justice's approval of the Transaction, (ii) the receipt of all required consents of the Federal Communications Commission to the transfer, assignment or change in control of certain licenses pursuant to the Transaction, (iii) the receipt of required consents from state public utility commissions, if any, and (iv) the absence of any injunction or final judgment prohibiting the consummation of the Transaction.  Consummation of the Transaction is not subject to any financing condition.
 
Among the assets included in the Transaction are Alltel's interests in certain partnerships that hold wireless assets in the Georgia and Ohio markets.  Interests in these partnerships are also held by third parties, who may have certain rights with respect the disposition of Verizon's partnership interests, including rights of first refusal and/or "tag-along" rights.  Although the Company does not believe that the Transaction gives rise to any of these third-party rights, Verizon and the Company have agreed in Section 5.17 of the Purchase Agreement to satisfy any of these rights if applicable.  If such rights of first refusal were applicable to the Transaction and were exercised in full by the third-parties, and if such exercise were approved by the applicable regulatory authorities, the Company would not acquire limited partnership interests in partnerships that operate a portion of the assets in Ohio (but it would still acquire controlling general partnership interests in these partnerships), nor would it acquire any interest in this market in Georgia, representing approximately 35,000 subscribers and an estimated reduction in the purchase price payable by the Company to Verizon of approximately $7.4 million.  If the Company offers to purchase third-party partnership interests pursuant to the "tag-along" rights that may be applicable, and if the third-parties accepted such offers in full, then the Company would incur an additional cost of approximately $5.4 million.  Although the Company does not believe that any of the foregoing third-party rights are triggered by the Transaction, it may enter into discussions with such third-parties regarding possible transactions involving these partnership interests.  At this time, there can be no assurance that any such transactions will or will not occur.  The Company's obligation to close the Transaction is not subject to any condition with respect to these partnership interests (but the aforementioned purchase price adjustments would be made, if applicable).
 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Company and Verizon have agreed to enter into a Roaming Agreement pursuant to which the subscribers of the Company in the acquired markets will be allowed to roam in wireless markets owned by Verizon and its affiliates, and Verizon's
 
subscribers will be allowed to roam within the acquired markets.  The Company and Verizon have also agreed to enter into a Transition Services Agreement, pursuant to which Verizon will provide certain services to the Company during a post-closing transition period.
 
A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Purchase Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Purchase Agreement.
 
Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
 
Statements in this Form 8-K regarding the proposed transaction, including whether the transaction will be completed and, if so, the expected timetable for any such completion; possible transactions with respect to the Georgia and Ohio third-party partnership interests; and the expected benefits of the transaction, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including: (i) the ability of ATN to secure financing  for the balance of the purchase price, which is dependent on market conditions;  there can be no assurances that such financing will be available to ATN at all or on terms that are favorable to ATN; (ii) the ability of ATN to operate a retail wireless business and integrate these operations into the operations of its Commnet subsidiary; (iii) the ability to receive the requisite regulatory consents and approvals to consummate the transaction; (iv) the outcome of any negotiations with the third-party holders of partnership interests in Georgia and Ohio and (v) the general performance of the acquired operations.  The information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof, and ATN disclaims any intention or obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this report.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Salem, MA
(June 9, 2009) - Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATNI) today
announced a definitive agreement to acquire certain wireless assets from Verizon Wireless for $200 million.  Under terms of the agreement, ATN will acquire wireless properties, including wireless spectrum licenses and network assets, serving over 800,000 subscribers primarily in rural areas across Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Ohio, and Idaho.  Verizon Wireless is required to divest these properties as part of the regulatory approvals granted for its purchase of Alltel earlier this year.
 
Under terms of the agreement, ATN will purchase the assets for $200 million in cash.  ATN expects to fund substantially all of the purchase price with cash-on-hand and borrowings under its existing credit facility.  As of April 30, 2009, ATN had approximately $90 million in cash and cash equivalents, $75 million of available borrowings under its undrawn revolving credit facility, and an additional $50 million of borrowing capacity, subject to lender consent, under its term credit facility.
 
The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including the
receipt of required consents and approvals from the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC.) 
ATN's obligation to close the transaction is not subject to any financing condition.  ATN expects the transaction to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2009.
 
 
"This is a very attractive transaction for ATN and it accomplishes what we have been patiently seeking over the past few years," said Michael Prior, ATN's President and Chief Executive Officer.   "It provides ATN with enhanced scale and revenue diversification and enables us to expand meaningfully our US wireless business.  Coupled with our existing US wireless operations, we will now have significant wireless operations in rural areas of more than 10 states.  Including our international operations, we expect to have more than 1,000,000 retail wireless subscribers by transaction close.  We believe that our long history of operating success in comparable markets, combined with our financial resources, makes these businesses an ideal fit for us.  We aim to further develop these markets for customers who want the attention and flexibility of a local operator.  We look forward to transitioning the employees and subscribers of the acquired businesses to ATN and to continue building our wireless business."

Second Quarter Highlights:
 
                 
Wireless revenue increased 47% year-over-year
                 
Operating income was $18.1 million, or 30% of revenue
                 
Net income decreases by 6% year-over-year as a result of early stage acquisitions and transactional related expenses
                 
Acquisition of Alltel properties progressing towards anticipated close later this year
 
Salem, MA
(July 30, 2009)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009.
 
Second Quarter Financial Results
 
For the three months ended June 30, 2009, revenue was $60.3million, 20% above the $50.4 million reported for the second quarter of 2008 and an 8% sequential increase over the first quarter. Wireless revenue increased 47% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, driven by significant growth in the Company's U.S. domestic wireless business, which more than offset the year-over-year and sequential decrease in international long distance revenue from the Company's Guyana operations.  Revenue for 2008 included revenue from Bermuda Digital Communications (BDC) beginning on May 15, 2008, the date the Company began consolidating BDC's operating results.  BDC revenue, prior to consolidation, for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008 was approximately $3.3 million and $8.6 million, respectively.
 
Despite the significant increase in revenue, operating income remained unchanged at $18.1 million as a result of costs associated with the revenue growth, as well as:
 
           
$1.5 million of operating losses at two earlier stage businesses acquired in the third quarter of 2008
           
$0.8 million of costs associated with the previously announced termination of our digital television services in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI)
           
$0.4 million related to the Company's pending acquisition of the Alltel properties
           
The reduction in high-margin international long distance revenue
 
 
Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders(1) was $9.6 million for the quarter compared to $10.2 million for the same period in 2008 and $8.8 million for the first quarter of 2009. On a per share basis, net income attributable to ATN's stockholders decreased 6% to $0.63 per diluted share from $0.67 per diluted share for last year's second quarter but was up 9% from the $0.58 per diluted share earned in the first quarter of 2009.
 
Commenting on second quarter results, Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer said, "This was another quarter of solid financial and operating performance for ATN, reflecting the resilience of our network and our ability to provide attractive alternatives to customers in underserved domestic and international markets. While we are not immune to the current economic environment, we succeeded in posting strong revenue growth resulting from our expanded U.S. network footprint and higher volumes of voice and data traffic. Operating income was $18.1 million, or 30% of revenue, despite the costs of expanding our network and terminating our television services in the USVI.  Although the early stage businesses we acquired in the second half of 2008 have also negatively impacted operating income, we are pleased overall with the strong growth in revenue and believe we are increasing the size of our platform for future cash flow and profit growth."
 
Recent Corporate Development
 
On June 9, 2009 the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire certain wireless assets from Verizon Wireless, which were part of Alltel Corporation prior to its acquisition by Verizon Wireless. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will acquire wireless properties, including wireless spectrum licenses and network assets serving approximately 800,000 subscribers primarily in rural areas across Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Ohio and Idaho for approximately $200 million in cash. Initial expectations are for this transaction to add approximately $450 million in revenue and be accretive upon completion. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including the receipt of required consents and approvals from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.
 
"This acquisition is an ideal fit for the Company because it greatly increases our U.S. wireless  network footprint and builds on the services we currently offer. It also provides us with greater revenue diversification and significant scale," Mr. Prior said. "Upon the completion of this transaction, we expect to have more than one million retail wireless subscribers in the U.S. and internationally. We will be offering our new customers the plans and differentiated service offerings they currently enjoy, plus a variety of new choices that have been popular with consumers in our other domestic markets.  We are confident that this transaction will be very positive for all of our constituents.  Please note, however, that transactional expenses are expected to increase significantly in the next two quarters and will reduce earnings until the acquisition closes.  Once closed, we expect the acquisition to be significantly accretive to earnings."
 
Second Quarter 2009 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 are compared against the same period in 2008 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue
 
Wireless revenue increased 47%, to $36.5 million from $24.8 million. Our U.S. rural wireless business increased revenue by 53%, to $25.8 million from $16.9 million benefiting from our ongoing investment in new base stations and the growth in recurring voice and data traffic. We ended the second quarter with a total of 537 base stations in our U.S. network, up from 367 base stations at the end of last year's second quarter and 484 base stations at the end of the 2009 first quarter. Of the increase in wireless revenue, $2.6 million was attributable to the consolidation of the operating results of BDC for the entire second
 
(1) As a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 160, Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements- an Amendment of ARB No. 51, the financial statement line item that had been entitled "Net income" under the previous reporting method is now entitled "Net income attributable to Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. Stockholders."
 
quarter of 2009 as compared to only a portion of the second quarter of 2008. Wireless revenue in Guyana increased by $0.2 million.  At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately 266,000 subscribers in Guyana, below the 277,000 we had at the end of last year's second quarter, but up from 248,000 as of December 31, 2008.
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue
 
Local telephone and data revenue increased 10% to $13.5 million compared to $12.3 million in 2008.  Sovernet's local telephone and data revenue increased 27%, to $4.7 million from $3.7 million in 2008, mainly due to its acquisition of ION in August 2008. Local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana operations increased 3% to $7.6 million compared to $7.4 million in 2008, while access lines increased 5% to 142,000 from 135,000.  Data revenue at our Virgin Islands subsidiary remained fairly stable.
 
International Long Distance Revenue
 
International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, declined 20% to $9.9 million from $12.4 million in 2008.  We believe this decrease is a result of a considerable increase in illegal bypass activities in the quarter resulting in lost revenue opportunities, as well as an overall reduction in call volume into Guyana attributable to the current difficult economic environment.
 
First Half 2009 Results
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2009, revenue was $116.3million, up 21% from the $96.0 million reported for last year's first half. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders(1) was $18.4 million for the year, as compared to $18.1 million for the same period in 2008, an increase of $0.3 million or 2%.  On a per share basis, net income attributable to ATN's stockholders(1) increased by 3% to $1.21 per diluted share from $1.18 per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2008.

Driving these revenue increases were 41% year-over-year and 18% sequential increases in the Company's wireless revenue fueled by significant growth in the Company's existing U.S. wireless business. The growth in wireless revenue more than offset the year-over-year and sequential decreases in international long distance revenue from the Company's Guyana operations.
 
Despite incurring approximately $2.0 million in acquisition-related expenses associated with the Company's pending acquisition of Alltel properties, third quarter 2009 operating income increased 13% over the third quarter of 2008 to $23.1 million from $20.4 million.
 
Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders(1) was $11.9 million for the quarter compared to $10.1 million for the same period in 2008 and $9.6 million for the second quarter of 2009. On a per share basis, net income attributable to ATN's stockholders increased 18% to $0.78 per diluted share from $0.66 per diluted share for last year's third quarter and was up 24% from the $0.63 per diluted share earned in the second quarter of 2009.
 
(1) As a result of our adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 160, Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements- an Amendment of ARB No. 51, the financial statement line item that had been entitled "Net income" under the previous reporting method is now entitled "Net income attributable to Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. Stockholders."
Commenting on the third quarter results, Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer said, "This was another very strong quarter for ATN with double digit revenue, operating income and earnings growth as compared to last year.  Wireless revenue accounted for roughly two-thirds of our third quarter revenue, driven by a 60% increase in U.S. rural wireless revenue.  If you exclude expenses related to the pending Alltel acquisition, operating and net income would show even more robust gains as all of our operations remained tightly focused on controlling costs  allowing profit growth to keep pace with revenue growth. However, we expect the Alltel related expenses to continue to increase as we rapidly add headcount and other resources, and incur transactional expenses such as legal and accounting fees, through the anticipated close in the next two to three months."
 
Update on Agreement to Acquire Alltel Properties
 
                 
On June 9, 2009 the Company announced a definitive agreement to acquire certain wireless assets from Verizon Wireless, which were part of Alltel Corporation prior to its acquisition by Verizon Wireless. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will acquire wireless properties, including wireless spectrum licenses and network assets serving approximately 800,000 subscribers primarily in rural areas across Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Ohio and Idaho for approximately $200 million in cash. Initial expectations are for this transaction to add approximately $450 million in annual revenue and be accretive to the Company's earnings upon completion. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, including the receipt of required consents and approvals from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.
 
                 
On September 30, 2009, the Company announced that Frank O'Mara, a former Executive Vice President of Alltel Communications has joined Atlantic Tele-Network as Chief Executive Officer of its newly-formed subsidiary, Atlantic Wireless Communications Corporation. O'Mara's duties as CEO will include leading the transition and operation of the former Alltel Wireless properties, licenses and network assets that ATN contracted to acquire.
 
"As we have previously stated, this transaction will provide us with important revenue and geographic diversification," Mr. Prior said. "Once completed, we expect to have well over one million retail subscribers in the U.S. and internationally and wireless revenue should account for more than 80% of our total revenues.  We recognize that we will face some significant challenges in undertaking this expansion, but as evidenced by our hire of Frank O'Mara to lead our U.S. retail wireless operations, we are confident that the people we are bringing on board will have the experience and insight to manage those risks."
 
Third Quarter 2009 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 are compared against the same period in 2008 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue
 
Wireless revenue increased 41%, to $42.9 million from $30.4 million. Our U.S. rural wireless business increased revenue by 60%, to $31.8 million from $19.9 million, benefiting from our ongoing investment in new base stations and the growth in recurring voice and data traffic. We ended the third quarter with a total of 564 base stations in our U.S. network, up from 396 base stations at the end of last year's third quarter and 537 base stations at the end of the 2009 second quarter. Wireless revenue in Guyana increased by $0.1 million as compared to the prior year.  At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately 277,000 subscribers in Guyana, up from the 273,000 we had at the end of last year's third quarter, and up from 266,000 as of the end of the 2009 second quarter.
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue
 
Local telephone and data revenue increased 9% to $13.9 million compared to $12.8 million in 2008.  Local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana operations increased 8% to $8.1 million compared to $7.5 million in 2008, while access lines increased 6% to 144,000 from 136,000. Sovernet's local telephone and data revenue increased 17%, to $4.8 million from $4.1 million in 2008, largely as a result of its acquisition of ION in August 2008.  Data revenue at our Virgin Islands subsidiary remained fairly stable as compared to the prior year.
International Long Distance Revenue
 
International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our GT&T subsidiary, declined 23% to $9.1 million from $11.8 million in 2008.  We believe this decrease is a result of continued and considerable illegal bypass activities in the quarter resulting in lost revenue opportunities, as well as an overall reduction in call volume into Guyana attributable to the current difficult global economic environment.
 
Year-To-Date 2009 Results
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, revenue was $182.2million, up 20% from the $152.0 million reported for the same period in 2008. Operating income increased $3.9 million, or 7%, to $58.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 from $54.1 million for the same period in 2008, in part due to the inclusion of $4.7 million of operating losses at two early stage businesses acquired during the third quarter of 2008, for which results were not included in the first half of 2008.  Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders(1) was $30.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, as compared to $28.2 million for the same period in 2008, an increase of $2.2 million or 8%.  On a per share basis, net income attributable to ATN's stockholders(1) increased by 7% to $1.98 per diluted share from $1.85 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2008.

Item 1.01
              
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On January 20, 2010, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement between the Company, as Borrower, certain of the Company's subsidiaries, as Guarantors, CoBank, ACB ("CoBank"), as Administrative Agent, Arranger, Issuer Lender and Lender, and the other Lenders named therein.  The credit agreement provides for a $298.9 million credit facility, consisting of a $73.9 million term loan (the "Term Loan A"), a $150.0 million term loan (the "Term Loan B") and a $75.0 million revolver loan (the "Revolver Loan," and together with the Term Loan A and Term Loan B, the "Credit Facility").  The Credit Facility also provides for one or more additional term loans up to an aggregate $50.0 million, subject to lender and administrative agent approval.
 
Upon the closing of the Credit Facility, $73.9 million was outstanding under the Term Loan A, an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the Company's previous term loan under the Company's prior credit facility.  No amount is currently outstanding under Term Loan B.  The proceeds of Term Loan B may be used by the Company solely in connection with the financing of its previously announced acquisition of wireless assets of Alltel Corporation (the "Alltel Acquisition") that are being divested by Verizon Wireless in connection with Verizon's acquisition of Alltel in 2009.   Borrowings under the Term Loan B are available to the Company until the earlier of (i) completion of the Alltel Acquisition and (ii) March 31, 2010.  The Company currently has no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver Loan, of which the Company may use up to $10.0 million for standby or trade letters of credit.
 
The Term Loan A and the Term Loan B each mature on September 30, 2014, unless accelerated pursuant to an event of default, as described below.  The Revolver Loan matures on September 10, 2014, unless accelerated pursuant to an event of default, as described below.  Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan A, Term Loan B and the Revolver Loan bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin ranging between 3.50% to 4.75% or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.75%.  The Company is not required to apply a minimum LIBOR percentage for any loans bearing interest at the LIBOR rate.  The base rate is equal to the higher of either (i) 1.50% plus the higher of (x) the one-week LIBOR and (y) the one-month LIBOR and (ii) the prime rate (as defined in the credit agreement).  The applicable margin is determined based on the ratio of the Company's indebtedness (as defined in the credit agreement) to its EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement).
 
All amounts outstanding under the Revolver Loan will be due and payable upon the earlier of the maturity date or the acceleration of the loan upon an event of default.  Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B will be due and payable commencing on March 31, 2010 in quarterly payments equal to 1.25% of the initial principal amount outstanding under each loan, increasing to 2.50% of the initial principal amount outstanding commencing on March 31, 2012.  Remaining balances will be due and payable upon maturity, unless the loans are accelerated upon an event of default.
 
Certain of the Company's subsidiaries, including Commnet Wireless, LLC, Sovernet, Inc. and Choice Communications, LLC, are guarantors of the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility.  Further, the Company's obligations are secured by (i) a first priority, perfected lien on substantially all the property and assets of the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries, including its principal wholly-owned domestic operating subsidiaries and (ii) a pledge of 100% of the Company's equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries and up to 65% of the equity interests outstanding of certain foreign subsidiaries, in each case, including the Company's principal operating subsidiaries.  Upon closing of the Alltel Acquisition and as a condition to the Term Loan B, certain subsidiaries formed by the Company in connection with the Alltel Acquisition must also become guarantors and the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility must be secured by a first priority, perfected lien on substantially all of the property
 
and assets of certain of the Company's subsidiaries formed in connection with the Alltel Acquisition and a pledge of 100% of the Company's equity interests in those subsidiaries.
 
The Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants by the Company limiting additional indebtedness, liens, guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes.
  In addition, the Credit Facility contains financial covenants by the Company that (i) impose a maximum ratio of indebtedness (as defined in the credit agreement) to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), (ii) require a minimum ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense, (iii) require a minimum ratio of equity to consolidated assets and (iv) require a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges (as defined in the credit agreement).
 
The Credit Facility provides for events of default customary for credit facilities of this type, including but not limited to non-payment, defaults on other debt, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, representations and warranties, insolvency and bankruptcy.  After the occurrence of an event of default and for so long as it continues, the administrative agent or the requisite lenders (as defined in the credit agreement) may increase the interest rate then in effect on all outstanding obligations by 2.0%.  Upon an event of default relating to insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will become immediately due and payable and the lender commitments will be automatically terminated.  Upon the occurrence and continuation of any other event of default, the administrative agent and/or the requisite lenders (as defined in the credit agreement) may accelerate payment of all obligations and terminate the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility.
 
The foregoing description is only a summary of the provisions of the Credit Facility and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the credit agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

If the Letter of Credit is payable in a foreign currency, the amount owed by Borrower in connection with such Letter of Credit shall equal the United States dollar equivalent of such foreign currency (determined by Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) on the date such payment is made by such Issuing Lender.  All amounts paid by an Issuing Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit that are not immediately repaid by Borrower or that are not repaid with a Revolver Loan shall bear interest at the sum of the Base Rate plus 3.750% per annum.  Each Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolver Loan made pursuant to this Subsection 1.1(F)(ii).  In the event Administrative Agent elects not to debit Borrower's account and Borrower fails to reimburse an Issuing Lender in full on the date of any payment in respect of a Letter of Credit issued for the account of any Loan Party, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender with a Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Loan Commitment of the amount of such unreimbursed payment and the accrued interest thereon and each such Lender, on the next Business Day, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share thereof in same day funds.  Each Lender with a Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Loan Commitment hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender upon demand by such Issuing Lender such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each payment made by such Issuing Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit and not immediately reimbursed by Borrower.  Each Lender with a Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Loan Commitment acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to acquire participations pursuant to this Subsection 1.1(F)(ii) in respect of Letters of Credit and to make the payments to each Issuing Lender required by the preceding sentence are absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or any
failure by Borrower to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Subsection 7.3.  If any Lender with a Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Loan Commitment fails to make available to an Issuing Lender the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any payments made by such Issuing Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit as provided in this Subsection 1.1(F)(ii), such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest at the Base Rate.

Initially, and continuing through the day immediately preceding the first Adjustment Date occurring after the Amendment Date, the applicable Base Rate Margin, LIBOR Margin and Commitment Fee Margin shall be the applicable per annum percentage set forth in the pricing table below opposite the applicable Total Leverage Ratio of Borrower, determined on a consolidated basis for Borrower and its Subsidiaries and calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any Loans requested by Borrower pursuant to this Agreement on the Amendment Date.  Thereafter, the applicable Base Rate Margin, LIBOR Margin and Commitment Fee Margin shall be for each Calculation Period the applicable per annum percentage set forth in the pricing table below opposite the applicable Total Leverage Ratio of Borrower, determined on a consolidated basis for Borrower and its Subsidiaries; , , in the event that Administrative Agent shall not receive the financial statements and Compliance Certificate required pursuant to Subsections 4.5(A), 4.5(B) and 4.5(C) when due, from such due date and until the fifth Business Day following Administrative Agent's receipt of such overdue financial statements and Compliance Certificate (and in the event a decrease in the applicable margin is then warranted, receipt of Borrower's written request to decrease such margin), the Base Rate Margin shall be 3.750% per annum, the LIBOR Margin shall be 4.750% per annum, and the Commitment Fee Margin shall be 0.750%; , , that effective upon the closing of any acquisition that will increase the Total Leverage Ratio on a pro forma basis, the Base Rate Margin, LIBOR Margin and Commitment Fee Margin will immediately adjust to reflect such higher ratio.

any LIBOR Interest Period that begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month or on a day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the last calendar month in such LIBOR Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of the last calendar month in such LIBOR Interest Period; and
 
(iv)
         
no LIBOR Interest Period shall be selected under any Term Loan Facility if, in order to make scheduled repayments of such Term Loan required pursuant to Subsection 1.6(A)(ii), (iii) or (iv), repayment of all or any portion of the LIBOR Loan prior to the expiration of such Interest Period would be necessary; and
(v)
          
no LIBOR Interest Period shall be selected under the Revolver Facility that extends beyond the date set forth in clause (B) of the definition of Revolver Expiration Date, and no LIBOR Interest Period shall be selected under any Term Loan Facility that extends beyond the date set forth in clause (B) of the definition of applicable Term Loan Maturity Date.

The date of payment (as determined in Subsection 1.5) of any Loan and the last day of a LIBOR Interest Period shall be excluded from the calculation of interest; , if a Loan is repaid on the same day that it is made, one (1) day's interest shall be charged.
provided
 
Interest accruing on Base Rate Loans is payable in arrears on each of the following dates or events: (i) the last day of each calendar quarter; (ii) the prepayment of such Loan (or portion thereof), to the extent accrued on the principal prepaid; and (iii) the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date or the Revolver Expiration Date, as the case may be, whether by acceleration or otherwise, with respect to the principal to be repaid.  Interest accruing on each LIBOR Loan is payable in arrears on each of the following dates or events: (1) the last day of each applicable LIBOR Interest Period; (2) if the LIBOR Interest Period is longer than three (3) months, on each three-month anniversary of the commencement date of such LIBOR Interest Period; (3) the prepayment of such Loan (or portion thereof), to the extent accrued on the principal prepaid; and (4) the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date or the Revolver Expiration Date, as the case may be, whether by acceleration or otherwise, with respect to the principal to be repaid.

Excess Interest
.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the aggregate interest, fees and other amounts required to be paid by Borrower to Lenders or any Lender hereunder are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity of the Indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders or any Lender for the use or the forbearance of the Indebtedness or Obligations evidenced hereby exceed the maximum permissible under Applicable Law.  If under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the limit of such validity prescribed by Applicable Law then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limit of
such validity and if under or from circumstances whatsoever Lenders or any Lender should ever receive as interest any amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, the amount of such interest that is excessive shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Obligations evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest.  Additionally, should the method used for calculating interest on LIBOR Loans (i.e., using a 360-day year) be unlawful, such calculation method shall be automatically changed to a 365-6-day year or such other lawful calculation method as is reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent.  This provision shall control every other provision of this Agreement and all provisions of every other Loan Document.

Each LIBOR Loan shall be made under any one of the Revolver Facility, the Term Loan A Facility, the Term Loan B Facility, or any Incremental Term Loan Facility, but may not be made under more than one Facility concurrently.  During any period in which any Event of Default is continuing, as the Interest Periods for LIBOR Loans then in effect expire, such Loans shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan and the LIBOR option will not be available to Borrower until all Events of Default are cured or waived. In the event Borrower fails to elect a LIBOR Loan upon any advance hereunder or upon the termination of any Interest Period, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to have such amount constitute a Base Rate Loan.  There shall be no more than an aggregate of five (5) LIBOR Loans outstanding at any one time under any Facility.

Each Lender represents to Administrative Agent that (i) it has, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, properties, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and the Acquired Companies and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and extend credit to Borrower hereunder, and (ii) it will, independently and without reliance upon Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, properties, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and the Acquired Companies.  Administrative Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information with respect thereto (other than as expressly required herein).

Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them). In performing its functions and duties hereunder, Administrative  Agent shall exercise the same care which it would in dealing with loans for its own account, but Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or for the execution, effectiveness,

Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Administrative Agent as a result of Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement, the Notes, or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders, except in connection with its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
 
(D)          .  Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any written or oral notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents or any telephone message or other communication (including any writing, electronic mail, telex, telecopy or telegram) believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to all matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of counsel selected by it in connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, administration, amendment, modification, waiver or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice with respect to rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

Guaranty of Secured Obligations by Guarantors
 
(A)          .  In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by Guarantors from the extensions of credit hereunder, each Guarantor hereby agrees with Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties as follows:  each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, to Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties of any and all Secured Obligations.  If any or all of the Secured Obligations become due and payable hereunder, each Guarantor unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, on order, or demand, together with any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties in collecting any of the Secured Obligations.  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that this is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection only.
The Guaranty
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Loan Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under Applicable Law (whether federal or state and including, the Bankruptcy Code).
 
Each Guarantor's maximum obligations hereunder (the "") in any case or proceeding referred to below (but only in such a case or proceeding) shall not be in excess of:
Maximum Guarantor Liability
 
(i)            in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code on or within two (2) years from the date on which any of the Secured Obligations are incurred, the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under (A) Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or (B) any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in such case or proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code; or
 
(ii)           in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code subsequent to two (2) years from the date on which any of the Secured Obligations of such Guarantor are incurred, the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in any such case or proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code;
 
(iii)          in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under any law, statute or regulation other than the Bankruptcy Code relating to dissolution, liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium, readjustment of debt, compromise, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization or similar debtor relief from time to time in effect affecting the rights of creditors generally (collectively, ""), the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under such Other Debtor Relief Law, including, any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in any such case or proceeding.  (The substantive state or federal laws under which the possible avoidance or unenforceability of the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) shall be determined in any such case or proceeding shall hereinafter be referred to as the "".)
Other Debtor Relief Law
Avoidance Provisions
To the extent set forth above, but only to the extent that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20, or the transfers made by such Guarantor under the Security Documents to which it is a party, would otherwise be subject to avoidance under any Avoidance Provisions if such Guarantor is not deemed to have received valuable consideration, fair value, fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for such transfers or obligations, or if such transfers or obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 would render such Guarantor insolvent, or leave such Guarantor with an unreasonably small capital or unreasonably small assets to conduct its business, or cause such Guarantor to have incurred debts (or to have intended to have incurred debts) beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, in each case as of the time any of the obligations of such Guarantor are deemed to have been incurred and transfers made under such Avoidance Provisions, then such obligations shall be reduced to that amount which, after giving effect thereto, would not cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations), as so reduced, to be subject to avoidance under such Avoidance Provisions.  This paragraph is intended solely to preserve the rights hereunder of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations to the maximum extent that would not cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 to be subject to avoidance under any Avoidance Provisions, and neither such Guarantor nor any other Person shall have any right, defense, offset, or claim under this paragraph as against Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations that would not otherwise be available to such Person under the Avoidance Provisions.
 
Each Guarantor agrees that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Guarantor Liability, without impairing the guaranty or any provision contained herein or affecting the rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder.
 
(B)           .  Additionally, each of Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all Secured Obligations whether or not due or payable upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Subsections 6.1(F) or (G) and unconditionally promises to pay such Secured Obligations on demand.  Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to the extent that Borrower or any Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer of an interest in any property to Administrative Agent or any Lender, which payment or transfer or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be repaid to Borrower or any Guarantor, the estate of Borrower or any Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.
Bankruptcy
 
(C)           .  The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the Secured Obligations whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or impaired by (i) any direction as to application of payment by Borrower or by any other party, or (ii) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Secured Obligations, or (iii) any
Nature of Liability
payment on or reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (iv) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by Borrower or other guarantor, or (v) any payment made to a Secured Party on the Secured Obligations which such Secured Party repays Borrower or another guarantor pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each of Guarantors waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.
 
(D)          .  The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor or Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other guarantor or Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor or Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.
Independent Obligation
 
(E)           .  Each of Guarantors authorizes each Secured Party without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to (i)  change the terms of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof, with the consent of Borrower, (ii) take and hold security from any other guarantor or any other party for the payment of this guaranty or the Secured Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security, and apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Administrative Agent and Lenders in their discretion may determine and (iii) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, Borrower or other obligors.
Authorization
 
(F)           .  It is not necessary for Administrative Agent or the Lenders to inquire into the capacity or powers of Borrower or any Guarantor or the officers, directors, members, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
Reliance
 
(G)           .
Waiver

Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense, other than payment in full of the Secured Obligations, based on or arising out of the disability of Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the indebtedness or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of Borrower other than payment in full of the indebtedness.  Any Secured Party may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by and conducted in accordance with Applicable Law), or exercise any other right or remedy any Secured Party may have against Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the indebtedness
has been paid.  Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election by any Secured Party, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantors against Borrower or any other party or any security.
 
(ii)           Each of the Guarantors waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, notices of nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness.  Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Secured Parties shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
(iii)          Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise, and irrevocably subordinates to the prior payment in full and in cash of the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and tax gross-up payment for which no claim has been asserted), any rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of the guaranties provided in this Subsection 9.20 (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of any Secured Party against Borrower or any other guarantor of the Secured Obligations (collectively, the "") and all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution or indemnity from any Other Party which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this guaranty.  Each of the Guarantors hereby further agrees until the Secured Obligations have been paid in full (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and tax gross-up payment for which no claim has been asserted) and all Loan Commitments terminated not to exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which any Secured Party now have or may hereafter have against any Other Party, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Secured Obligations and any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security or collateral given to or for the benefit of any Secured Party to secure payment of the Secured Obligations or any Other Party.
Other Parties
 
(H)          .  Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties agree that the guaranties provided in this Subsection 9.20 may be enforced only by the action of Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders and that no Secured Party shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce any such guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties under the terms of this Agreement.
Limitation on Enforcement
 
(I)            .  Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after payment of the indebtedness and obligations which are the subject of the guaranties provided in this Subsection 9.20 and termination of the Loan Commitments, confirm to Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person that the such Secured Obligations have been

paid and the commitments relating thereto terminated, subject to the provisions of Subsection 9.20(B).
 
(J)            .  Any Indebtedness of Borrower or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor (a "") is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Secured Obligations, and any such Indebtedness collected or received by a Subordinated Intercompany Lender following the occurrence of any Event of Default shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties to be credited and applied against the Secured Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the Subordinated Intercompany Lender under any other provision hereof.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Salem, MA
(January 25, 2010)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported that it has amended and restated its existing senior secured credit facility, providing for the addition of a new $150 million term loan to be used to fund the Company's previously announced pending acquisition of former Alltel Corporation assets from Verizon Wireless.   The amended and restated credit facility also includes a $73.9 million term loan, which is the amount of the term loan outstanding under the Company's previous credit facility and a $75 million revolving loan, which was also available under its previous credit facility.  CoBank, ACB acted as administrative agent and lead arranger in the transaction.
 
The Company expects to borrow the entire amount of the new $150 million term loan in connection with the proposed acquisition of the former Alltel assets, which the Company currently expects to complete, subject to the receipt of certain regulatory consents, during the first quarter of 2010.
 
The term loans mature on September 30, 2014 and the revolving loan matures on September 10, 2014.  Amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin ranging from 3.50% to 4.75% or (b) a base rate (equal to the higher of (x) 1.50% plus LIBOR or (y) the prime rate) plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.75%.
 
Alltel Acquisition Update
 
Based upon the most current available information, which indicates a stable subscriber base of over 800,000 post-paid and pre-paid subscribers, the Company expects annual service
 
 
revenues, which excludes revenues from handset and equipment sales, from the acquired Alltel assets to be approximately $450 - $500 million for the first twelve months following the close of the transaction. Current internal projections call for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margins from the Alltel assets to be below industry standards during that period, reflecting front-loaded transition and operating expenses.   EBITDA margins are expected to progressively increase in the period and to reach more normalized levels, ranging from 20% to 30% by 2011. The Company's estimates are based on current information and assumptions and are therefore subject to change.  The Company intends to provide an update to these estimates as part of its fourth quarter earnings announcement in early March.
 
"We are moving ahead to ensure that we provide our customers with a seamless transition once the Alltel acquisition is completed, which we expect will be within the first quarter of this year," said Michael Prior, CEO of Atlantic Tele-Network. "We have succeeded in attracting a formidable corporate leadership team for these operations comprised of many former Alltel executives and led by Frank O'Mara, former Executive Vice President of Alltel. Also, our decision to locate the subsidiary headquarters in Little Rock, Arkansas will give us ready access to an experienced and knowledgeable workforce
," noted Mr. Prior.

Salem, MA
(March 4, 2010)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009.
 
Fourth Quarter Financial Results
 
For the three months ended December 31, 2009, revenue was $59.5million, 7% above the $55.4 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2008.  The revenue increase was driven by a significant increase in the Company's wireless revenue.  The Company's U.S. domestic wireless business grew 35% year-over-year, more than offsetting the year-over-year decrease in international long distance revenue from the Company's Guyana operations.
 
Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $11.7 million as compared to $15.5 million in 2008.  Operating income was negatively affected by $4.7 million of expenses incurred during the fourth quarter relating to the Company's pending $200 million acquisition of certain Alltel wireless assets.  Operating income excluding these costs was $16.3 million. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $5.2 million compared to $6.6 million for the same period in 2008. Earnings per diluted share were $0.33 per share, compared to the $0.43 reported for last year's fourth quarter. Excluding acquisition related charges in both years, net income was $8.0 million or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $7.2 million or $0.47 per share in 2008.
 
Commenting on the fourth quarter results, Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer said, "This was another solid quarter for ATN as we continued to expand our U.S. wireless network coverage and maintained or increased our market share positions in wireless throughout our key geographies.  Wireless revenue accounted for approximately 60% of our total revenues, up from 54% in last year's fourth quarter primarily driven by a 35% increase in U.S. rural wireless revenue.    The growth in U.S wireless revenues for the quarter more than offset the continuing decline in international long distance
 
 
revenue in Guyana.  Local telephone and data revenue also benefited from network upgrades and expansion in the Virgin Islands, the northeastern United States and Guyana.
 
"Our network expansions in 2009 included more than 100 additional base stations in our US wireless network in the Southwest, new fiber projects and switch capabilities in New England and network extensions in upstate New York.  We have some significant network additions ahead of us in 2010 as well, including the projected turn up of a state-of-the art fiber optic subsea cable into Guyana in the second or third quarter; and our plan to begin utilizing the $39.7 million federal stimulus grant that our ION subsidiary was recently awarded in conjunction with the Development Authority of the North Country.  That grant will be used to build ten new segments of fiber-optic, middle-mile broadband infrastructure serving more than 70 rural communities in upstate New York and parts of Pennsylvania and Vermont."
 
Looking ahead to 2010, outside the growth expected as a result of the Alltel transaction, near-term growth prospects for our existing businesses may be negatively affected by the impact of the pending AT&T purchase of Alltel assets that overlap our U.S. rural wireless business, and the possible continued decline of our legacy international long distance business.  Our network expansion plans for our existing businesses are very promising for revenue and profit growth over the long term, but are not likely to produce enough revenue growth to offset the impact of these events.  Of course, the anticipated completion of our Alltel transaction in early 2010 will result in substantial revenue growth for ATN overall, and profits should follow."
 
Update on Acquisition of Alltel Assets
 
                 
On January 25, 2010, the Company announced that the most current information indicated that the Alltel assets had a subscriber base of over 800,000 post-paid and pre-paid subscribers.  Further, the Company stated that annualized service revenues from the acquired assets were expected to range from $450 million to $500 million in the first twelve months following the anticipated close of the transaction. EBITDA margins are projected to be below industry standards during that period due to front-loaded transition and operating expenses but are expected to progressively increase in the period and to reach more normalized levels of between 20% and 30% some time in 2011.
 
"As we noted in our third quarter 2009 earnings release" Mr. Prior said, "expenses related to the pending Alltel asset acquisition increased significantly on a sequential basis as we incurred transactional costs and added headcount and other resources in preparation for the transition to our ownership. While the regulatory approval process has taken longer than we originally anticipated, we are optimistic that we will receive approval and complete this acquisition in the next month or two.   In the meantime, we continue to invest significant financial and other resources in order to ensure a smooth and seamless transition for our prospective customers and employees."
 
Fourth Quarter 2009 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 are compared against the same period in 2008 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue
 
Wireless revenue increased 20%, to $35.9 million from $30.0 million. Our U.S. rural wireless business increased revenue by 35%, to $25.4 million from $18.8 million, benefiting from our ongoing investment in new base stations and the growth in recurring voice and data traffic. As expected, seasonality factors caused fourth quarter 2009 U.S. rural wireless revenues to be below those of our third quarter 2009. We ended the fourth quarter with a total of 580 base stations in our U.S. network, up from 473 base stations at the end of last year's fourth quarter and 564 base stations at the end of the 2009 third quarter. Wireless revenue in Guyana increased 16% to $5.9 million.  At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately 289,000 subscribers in Guyana, up from the 248,000 at the end of last year's fourth quarter, and up from 277,000 as of the end of the third quarter of 2009.
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue
 
Local telephone and data revenue increased 11% to $14.8 million compared to $13.3 million in 2008.  Local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana operations increased 8% to $8.2 million compared to $7.6 million in 2008, while access lines increased 6% to 147,000 from 139,000. Sovernet's local telephone and data revenue increased 4%, to
 
 
$4.8 million from $4.6 million in fourth quarter of 2008, due mainly to revenue growth at its fiber transport subsidiary, ION.  Data revenue at our U.S. Virgin Islands operations also increased as compared to the prior year.
 
International Long Distance Revenue
 
International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our Guyana operations, declined 21% to $8.8 million from $11.1 million in 2008.  We believe this decrease is a result of continued and considerable illegal bypass activities in the quarter resulting in lost revenue opportunities, and, to a lesser extent, an overall reduction in call volume into Guyana attributable to the current difficult global economic environment.
 
Full Year 2009 Results
 
                 
Total revenue increased 17% to $241.7 million from $ 207.3 million in 2008
                 
Wireless revenue increased 40% to $147.0 million from $105.0 million
                 
Operating Income was $69.7 million compared to $69.5 million. Excluding acquisition-related charges in both years, operating income was $76.9 million, up 9% from $70.6 million in 2008.
                 
Net income was $35.5 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, compared to $34.8 million or $2.28 per diluted share.  Excluding acquisition-related charges in both years, net income was $39.8 million, up 12% from $35.4 million in 2008.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other matters, the future financial performance and results of operations of the Company; the proposed transaction with Verizon Wireless, including whether the transaction will be completed and, if so, the expected timetable for such completion and the expected benefits of the transaction; demand for our services and industry trends; the pace of our network expansion and improvement, including our realization of the benefits of these investments; and management's plans and strategy for the future. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results. Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1) the availability of borrowings under the Company's amended and restated credit agreement for the acquisition through March 31, 2010; (2) the ability of ATN to operate a retail wireless business and integrate these operations into its existing operations; (3) the ability to receive the requisite regulatory consents and approvals to consummate the transaction; (4) the general performance of the acquired Alltel operations; (5) significant political and regulatory risk facing our exclusive license to provide local exchange and international voice and data services in Guyana; (6) any significant decline in the price or volume, including bypass activities, of international long distance calls to Guyana; (7) the regulation of rates that GT&T may charge for local wireline telephone service; (8) significant tax disputes between GT&T and the Guyanese tax authorities; (9) the derivation of a significant portion of our U.S. wireless revenue from a small number of customers and the extent to which our wholesale customers build or acquire overlapping networks; (10) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements, including the rates Commnet charges its wholesale customers; (11) the current global economic recession, along with difficult and volatile conditions in the capital and credit markets; (12) increased competition; (13) economic, political and other risks facing our foreign operations; (14) regulatory changes affecting our businesses; (15) the loss of certain FCC licenses; (16) rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (17) our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure; (18) any loss of any key members of management; (19) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of our network capacity and customer service system to support our customer growth; (20) dependence of our wireless and wireline revenue on the reliability and performance of our network infrastructure; (21) the occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes; and (22) our ability to realize the value that we believe exists in businesses that we acquire. These and other additional factors that may cause actual future events and results to differ materially from the events and results indicated in the forward-looking statements above are set forth more fully under Item 1A "Risk Factors" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, which are on file with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors that may affect such forward-looking statements.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures.  Specifically, the company has presented non-GAAP measures of operating income, net income attributable to ATN's stockholders, earnings per diluted share attributable to ATN's stockholders, in each case by excluding charges related to our pending acquisition of certain Alltel assets.   The company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the pending Alltel transaction.   ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.   Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this news release.

Item 2.01          Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
 
On April 26, 2010, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") completed its previously-announced acquisition of wireless assets from Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless ("Verizon") pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated June 9, 2009, by and between the Company and Verizon.  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Verizon contributed certain licenses, network assets, tower and other leases and other assets and certain related liabilities to a wholly-owned subsidiary limited liability company, whose membership interests were acquired by Allied Wireless Communications Corporation ("AWCC"), the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary.  In connection with the acquisition, the Company and Verizon entered into roaming and transition services arrangements, and the Company obtained the rights to use the Alltel brand and related service marks for a twenty-eight year total term in connection with the continuing operation of the acquired assets.  The purchase price was $200 million, plus approximately $23 million in connection with a customary net working capital adjustment.
 
The Company funded the purchase price with cash-on-hand and borrowings under its existing credit facility.  The Company drew down the $150 million term loan (the "Term Loan B") under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of January 20, 2010, by and among the Company, certain of the Company's subsidiaries, as Guarantors, CoBank, ACB, as Administrative Agent, Arranger, Issuer Lender and Lender, and the other Lenders named therein (as amended to date, the "Credit Agreement").  In addition, the Company borrowed $40 million under its
previously undrawn $75 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolver Loan").  The Credit Agreement, including the Term Loan B and the Revolver Loan, is described in Item 1.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 25, 2010, which description is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On April 26, 2010, the Company issued a press release announcing the completion of the acquisition, a copy of which is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.
 
 
The information set forth above under Item 2.01 is hereby incorporated by reference in response to this Item 2.03.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Salem, MA
(April 26, 2010)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) announced today that it has completed the purchase of certain former Alltel wireless assets from Verizon Wireless. The total purchase price was $223 million, which includes $23 million of acquired net working capital. The purchase was funded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's current credit facility. The acquisition, which was completed through the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Allied Wireless Communications Corporation (AWCC), includes wireless properties and licenses that serve approximately 895,000 subscribers in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Ohio, and Idaho.  The Company currently expects that these properties will generate approximately $500 million in annual service revenues during the first twelve months of its operation of the assets.
 
In addition, ATN announced that it has acquired a license to continue use of the Alltel name and accompanying service marks, including My Circle, in the acquired markets for an initial term of fourteen years and a total term of up to twenty-eight years. ATN may expand its use of the brand outside of these acquired markets subject to covered population limitations and certain other conditions.
 
 
"We appreciate the hard work of all parties in closing this transaction," said Michael Prior, ATN's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We have a very experienced management team in place at AWCC, led by Frank O'Mara, a former senior executive at Alltel, and welcome our new employees who support these markets.  Consumers recognize the Alltel brand for value, service and choice, and we plan to continue operating our business with the same approach in these markets."
 
Verizon Wireless was required to divest these properties as part of the regulatory approvals granted for its purchase of Alltel in January 2009.  Although the Company will initially launch service to a higher number of subscribers than previously reported, a high percentage of this increased number are pre-paid subscribers, and the Company currently expects to see net attrition to the subscriber base in the first year and a higher rate of churn overall during the transition phase.  The acquisition of these properties by the Company was approved by the U.S. Department of Justice on April 7, 2010, and by the Federal Communications Commission on April 20, 2010.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
                 
Wireless Revenue up 4.4% to $33.1 Million
                 
Total Revenue down 2%  to $54.7 Million
                 
Operating Income Adjusted for Acquisition-Related Expenses down 22% to $13.1 Million
 
Salem, MA
(May 6, 2010)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
 
First Quarter Financial Results
 
For the three months ended March 31, 2010, revenue was $54.7million compared to the $56.0 million reported for the first quarter of 2009. The $1.4 million year-over-year increase in wireless revenue was driven by a 6% increase in U.S. domestic wireless revenue, and a 14% increase in wireless revenue in Guyana.   International long distance revenue from the Company's Guyana operations declined 24%.
 
Operating income for the first quarter of 2010 was $7.4 million compared to $16.8 million in 2009.  Operating income was negatively affected by $5.7 million of acquisition-related charges and increased general and administrative expenses associated with the Company's acquisition of certain Alltel wireless assets, which closed on April 26, 2010.  Excluding these costs, operating income was $13.1 million. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $4.0 million compared to $8.8 million for the same period in 2009. Earnings per diluted share were $0.26 per share, compared to the $0.58 reported for last year's first quarter. Excluding acquisition related charges net income was $7.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share.
 
Commenting on first quarter results, Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer said, "Operating income this quarter was negatively impacted by two major factors.  First, we incurred an additional $5.7 million of costs associated with closing the Alltel acquisition, and second, we saw a sharp reduction in our international long distance revenue, which is relatively high margin revenue with very little immediate offsetting cost reduction.   Adjusted for acquisition-related costs, our operating margin was 24%, which we consider respectable in light of the sharp fall-off in that high-margin business, which now represents about 14% of total revenue. We expect these revenues to represent approximately 3-5% of total company revenues once we have an entire quarter of revenue contribution from the recently acquired Alltel assets.  We were pleased that our existing wholesale U.S. wireless business continued to grow, albeit at a more
 
 
moderate pace than previous quarters, with tighter operating margins due to rate reductions and higher depreciation expense.
 
"In the first quarter we continued to invest for long-term growth and incurred capital expenditures totaling $16.9 million, which was 70% greater than the first quarter of 2009.  Recent investments of $4.3 million towards the undersea cable build into Guyana, $4.4 million by our U.S. wholesale wireless business, and $4.4 million on our wireless network build-out in the U.S. Virgin Islands, are indicative of this approach.   We have a number of projects like those, and of course, the much larger investment in the Alltel wireless assets, that hold great promise for longer term earnings growth.
 
"We believe this strategy and our expertise in serving rural niche markets were major factors in the National Telecommunications & Information Administration's decision in the first quarter to award us, through our partnership with the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, with a combined total award of $32.1 million in federal stimulus grant funds. Through our Commnet subsidiary, we will deploy a 4G LTE network to provide last mile services to over 30,000 households and 1,000 businesses in the Navajo Nation across rural areas of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. We were previously awarded in the fourth quarter of 2009 a $39.7 million federal stimulus grant to our ION subsidiary, in partnership with the Development Authority of the North Country to build ten new segments of fiber-optic, middle-mile broadband infrastructure serving more than 70 rural communities in upstate New York and parts of Pennsylvania and Vermont."
 
The Acquisition of Alltel Assets
 
                 
On April 26, 2010, the Company completed the purchase of certain former Alltel wireless assets from Verizon Wireless for a total purchase price of $223 million, which included $23 million of acquired working capital. The purchase was funded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the Company's current credit facility. The acquisition included wireless properties and licenses that serve approximately 895,000 subscribers in rural areas of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Ohio and Idaho. These properties are currently expected to generate approximately $475-$500 million in annual service revenues during the first twelve months of operations by ATN.  In addition, the Company also acquired a license to continue use of the Alltel name and accompanying service marks, including My Circle, in the acquired markets and may expand the use of the brand outside of the acquired markets subject to covered population limitations and certain other conditions.
 
"With this major acquisition completed, we expect wireless revenues will account for over 85% of ATN's annualized revenues, with the majority of that revenue coming from our U.S. domestic businesses." noted Mr. Prior. "While this is a significant change in our business mix, it reflects the continuation of our strategy to effectively serve and grow rural and niche markets."
 
First Quarter 2010 Operating Highlights
 
The following operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 are compared against the same period in 2009 unless otherwise indicated.
 
Wireless Revenue
 
Wireless revenue increased 4%, to $33.1 million from $31.7 million. Our U.S. domestic wireless business increased revenue by 6%, to $22.9 million from $21.6 million. While we have benefited from our ongoing investment in new base stations and growth in recurring voice and data traffic, this growth was partially offset by data and voice rate reductions going into effect this quarter and during the second half of 2009.  We ended the first quarter with a total of 586 base stations in our U.S. network, up from 484 base stations at the end of last year's first quarter and 580 base stations at the end of the 2009 fourth quarter. Wireless revenue in Guyana increased 14% to $5.6 million.  At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 286,000 subscribers in Guyana, up from 254,000 at the end of last year's first quarter, and comparable to the 289,000 as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2009.
 
Local Telephone and Data Revenue
 
Local telephone and data revenue increased 5% to $13.7 million compared to $13.1 million in 2009.  Local telephone and data revenue generated by our Guyana operations increased 4% to $7.7 million
 
compared to $7.4 million in 2009, while access lines increased 6% to 148,000 from 140,000. Sovernet's local telephone and data revenue increased 7%, to $4.9 million from $4.6 million in last year's first quarter, due mainly to revenue growth at its fiber transport subsidiary, ION.
 
International Long Distance Revenue
 
International long distance revenue, all of which is generated by our Guyana operations, declined 24% to $7.9 million from $10.4 million in 2009.  The majority of this decrease, we believe, is a result of continued and considerable illegal bypass activities in the quarter resulting in lost revenue opportunities, and, to a lesser extent, an overall reduction in call volume into Guyana attributable to the current difficult global economic conditions. We also believe that this revenue category suffers from overall industry trends in telecommunications that are shifting voice communications to various forms of data communications. In addition, long distance revenue was negatively impacted as a result of lower outbound calling rates we introduced in January 2010 as part of a promotion finally approved by the regulatory authorities.   We feel that lower outbound rates, while having a negative impact in the short-term, will eventually lead to more outbound calling and traffic volumes that may replace some of the inbound "bypass" calls.

These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results. Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1) the ability of ATN to operate a retail wireless business and integrate these operations into its existing operations; (2) the general performance of the acquired Alltel operations; (3) significant political and regulatory risk facing our exclusive license to provide local exchange and international voice and data services in Guyana; (4) any significant decline in the price or volume, including bypass activities, of international long distance calls to Guyana; (5) the regulation of rates that GT&T may charge for local wireline telephone service; (6) significant tax disputes between GT&T and the Guyanese tax authorities; (7) the derivation of a significant portion of our U.S. wireless revenue from a small number of customers and the extent to which our wholesale customers build or acquire overlapping networks; (8) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements, including the rates Commnet charges its wholesale customers and the rates AWCC pays

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures.  Specifically, the company has presented non-GAAP measures of operating income, net income attributable to ATN's stockholders, earnings per diluted share attributable to ATN's stockholders, in each case by excluding charges related to our pending acquisition of certain Alltel assets.   The company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the pending Alltel transaction.   ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.   Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this news release.
 
 
 
 
 
 
* Acquisition-Related Charges include $4,793 of external costs and $892 of internal costs.

TOGETHER WITH REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
 
 
 
 
 
To the Board of Directors of Cellco Partnership, doing business as Verizon Wireless Capital LLC:
 
In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheetand the related combined statements of operations, equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Alltel Divested Markets, a combination of certain assets and liabilities of Alltel Corporation ("the Markets") at December 31, 2009 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the period from January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009 (the Successor period), in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These financial statements are the responsibility of Cellco Partnership's ("the Company") management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
As disclosed in Note 2, the Markets adopted the new accounting standard relating to noncontrolling interests on January 1, 2009.
 
As disclosed in Note 14, the Markets, the Company and its subsidiaries, engage in extensive intercompany transactions, and the Markets rely on the Company for a significant portion of its administrative support, for which it is allocated costs on a basis that management believes is appropriate under the circumstances.  The amounts recorded for these transactions and allocations are not necessarily representative of the amounts that would have been reflected in the financial statements had the Markets been an entity operated independently of the Company.
 
As discussed in Note 15, on April 26, 2010, Verizon Wireless completed the sale of the Markets to Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.

These financial statements are the responsibility of Alltel Corporation's ("the Company") management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

ORGANIZATION
 
Description of Business
 
The accompanying combined financial statements present, on an historical cost basis, the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to 26 cellular market areas operating in the states of Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, and South Carolina (collectively "the Markets") owned by
Cellco Partnership, a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group Plc doing business as Verizon Wireless ("the Successor" or "VZW").  The Markets were previously owned by Alltel Corporation ("the Predecessor" or "Alltel"), prior to Alltel's acquisition by VZW ("Acquisition") on January 9, 2009, upon which Alltel became a wholly-owned subsidiary of VZW.  Pursuant to an order by the Antitrust Department of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") and as a condition of the Acquisition, VZW is required to divest the Markets to avoid anti-competitive practices within specific cellular properties and markets.  As required by the DOJ order, on January 9, 2009, the Markets were transferred to a court-appointed management trustee and held in trust, (collectively referred to henceforth as "the Trust").  The Trust provides management oversight and other fiduciary services to the Markets in the ordinary course of business and will continue to operate the Markets until they are sold.  As further discussed in Note 15, on June 9, 2009, VZW entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Markets to Atlantic Tele-Network Inc. ("ATN") for $200 million in cash.  The sale transaction was completed on April 26, 2010.
 
The Markets do not operate as a separate standalone legal entity and are comprised of certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, majority-owned partnerships and other component operations of VZW and Alltel.  The Markets provide wireless voice and data communications services through code division multiple access ("CDMA") technology to approximately 0.8 million customers as of December 31, 2009.  The Markets also offer their services to customers of other wireless carriers utilizing both CDMA and global system for mobile communications ("GSM") technologies.  The Markets are comprised of a number of metropolitan service areas ("MSAs") and rural service areas ("RSAs"), which represent licensed geographic areas, as defined by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC").
 
VZW accounted for the acquisition of Alltel as a business combination under the acquisition method. 
VZW completed the appraisals necessary to assess the fair values of the Markets' tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date. 
Pursuant to rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), VZW's post-acquisition basis in the Markets has been pushed-down to establish a new accounting basis for the Markets.  As a result,
VZW recorded purchase accounting adjustments to establish the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets, assumed liabilities, deferred taxes and noncontrolling interests of the Markets, as further illustrated in Note 3, "Acquisition of Alltel by VZW."
 
Prior to its acquisition by VZW, Alltel had been acquired on November 16, 2007 by Atlantis Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Atlantis Holdings") and an affiliate of private investment funds TPG Partners V, L.P. and GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P.  The acquisition was completed through the merger of Atlantis Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlantis Holdings, with and into Alltel (the "Merger"), with Alltel surviving the Merger as a privately-held, majority-owned subsidiary of Atlantis Holdings
. 
Although Alltel continued as the same legal entity after the Merger, Atlantis Holdings' cost of acquiring Alltel was pushed-down to establish a new accounting basis for Alltel and the Markets, respectively.
 
Alltel accounted for the Merger as a purchase business combination.  Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price has been allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill.  In connection with the purchase price allocation, Alltel recorded purchase accounting adjustments to increase the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and investments in unconsolidated partnerships, to establish intangible assets for wireless licenses, trademarks and trade-names, customer list, non-compete agreement and favorable roaming agreement and to revalue long-term debt and benefit plan obligations.  As a result of the above Merger, certain purchase accounting adjustments were allocated to the Markets' tangible and intangible net assets, as further illustrated in Note 4, "
Acquisition of Alltel by Two Private Investment Firms."
 
As a result of the Acquisition and Merger discussed above, the accompanying combined financial statements are presented for three periods to show the financial results of the Markets for the period after the Acquisition (Successor), the period after the Merger and before the Acquisition (Predecessor II) and the period prior to the Merger (Predecessor I).  These periods relate to the accounting periods preceding and succeeding the push-down of VZW's and Atlantis Holdings' basis, respectively.  The Predecessor and Successor periods have been separated by two vertical lines on the face of the combined financial statements to highlight the fact that the financial information has been prepared under different historical cost bases of accounting.  The accounting policies followed by the Markets in the preparation of its combined financial statements for the Successor period are materially consistent with those of the Predecessor periods.
 
For periods prior to January 9, 2009, Alltel's relationship with the Markets was that of the Parent, as the Markets operated as a part of Alltel's consolidated wireless business.  As a result of the Acquisition, VZW became the Parent of the Markets effective January 9, 2009, and subsequent to that date, the Markets operated as a part of VZW, under the oversight of the Trust.  Accordingly, references to the "Parent" included in the notes to combined financial statements refer to VZW for periods subsequent to January 8, 2009 (Successor) and Alltel for all periods prior to January 9, 2009 (Predecessor I and II).
 
As a result of the establishment of the Trust, certain discrete financial information for the Markets is available for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009 and January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009.  Accordingly, for periods ending on or before December 31, 2008, financial information for the Markets was derived by combining financial information of standalone operating entities for which discrete financial information was available ("non-embedded markets") with portions of operating entities for which discrete financial information was not available ("embedded markets").  Financial information was not available for these embedded markets because the Predecessor did not record transactions at a market level, but rather at an operating entity level, and an operating entity may be comprised of more than one contiguous market.  The non-embedded markets consist of one or more contiguous markets that are combined into an operating entity that is being fully divested. For the embedded markets, the Predecessor was not able to specifically identify certain transactions to the market being divested because only a portion of the operating entity is being divested.  For these markets, certain assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses were allocated using an appropriate allocation factor/metric, primarily based on the divested portion of the embedded markets' customers in relation to the total customers for the operating entity.  These allocation methodologies are discussed further
in Note
2
, "Significant Accounting Policies."
 
Basis of Presentation
 
These combined financial statements have been derived from the financial statements and accounting records of the Parent using the historical results of operations and historical cost basis of the assets and liabilities of the Markets.  The combined financial statements of the Markets reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributed to the Markets, as well as allocations deemed necessary by management, to fairly present the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Markets, as discussed further below.
 
The Parent
performs cash management activities for the Markets on a centralized basis and processes accounts payable, payroll and other activity on behalf of the Markets.  These amounts have been accounted for through the Net parent investment account, because it is not practicable to specifically identify the portion of cash and accounts payable related to the Markets (see Note 14 for further description).Intercompany receivables and payables between the Markets and other Predecessor and Successor affiliates have been accounted for through the Net parent investment account in the combined financial statements.
 
The Parent did not push down long-term debt to the Markets' combined financial statements because it is not specifically identifiable to the Markets.
 
The combined statements of operations report revenues and costs attributable to the Markets including allocations of certain equipment revenues and related costs and allocations of costs for Parent-provided support services and Parent corporate costs.  These revenues and costs are reflected in the combined financial statements using various allocation methodologies discussed further in Notes
2
and
14
and include providing certain legal, finance, human resource and other administrative services, including various corporate wide employee benefit programs.  The allocations and estimates contained in the combined financial statements are based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances.
 
The combined financial statements included herein may not be indicative of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Markets in the future or if the Markets had been a separate, standalone entity during the periods presented.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Principles of Combination
 
The accompanying combined financial statements include the accounts of the Markets' wholly-owned subsidiaries, the partnerships in which the Markets exercise control, and one unconsolidated partnership which the Markets account for using the equity method.  These combined financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP").  The combined financial statements include the combined assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to the Markets.  All significant intercompany accounts and transactions among and between the Markets have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying combined financial statements.  All transactions with the Parent and its affiliates included in the accompanying combined financial statements have been treated as related party transactions.
 
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Estimates are used for, but not limited to, the accounting for: allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, unbilled revenue, fair values of financial instruments, useful lives of depreciable and amortizable assets, accrued expenses, asset impairments, allocation of the purchase price in business combinations, allocation of shared revenues and expenses, income taxes, contingencies, and allocation of certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses related to embedded markets.  Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed by management and the effects of any material revisions are reflected in the accompanying combined financial statements in the period that they are determined to be necessary.
 
Fair Value Measurements
 
In accordance with the accounting standard regarding fair value measurements, fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.  This accounting standard also establishes a three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
 
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 3 - No observable pricing inputs in the market
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.  The Markets' assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires significant judgment, and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.
 
Cash
 
The Markets have small cash accounts to support operations outside the normal cash management and treasury functions and have no other cash or cash equivalents.
 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
 
Accounts receivable consist principally of trade receivables from customers, are generally unsecured, due within 30 days and do not bear interest.  The Markets maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.  In establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Markets consider a number of factors including historical collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable balances, current economic conditions, and a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations to the Markets.  When internal collection efforts on accounts have been exhausted, the accounts are written off by reducing the allowance for doubtful accounts.
For embedded markets,
accounts receivable are not specifically identified.  Receivables were allocated to the embedded markets based on the divested portion of the embedded markets' customers in relation to the total customers for the operating entity.  The related allowance was allocated to the embedded markets using the same customer percentage.
 
Investment in Unconsolidated Partnership
 
The
investment in unconsolidated partnership is accounted for using the equity method.  The investment balance includes the related excess of the purchase price paid over the underlying net book value of the wireless partnership.  In connection with the Acquisition and the Merger, the Markets recorded a write-up in the carrying value of this investment to fair value.  Accordingly, the carrying value of excess cost included in the investment balance was $17.2 million and $16.9 million at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.  The investment in unconsolidated partnership is periodically reviewed for impairment.  If the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference.  The carrying value of the investment in unconsolidated partnership approximated fair value at December 31,
2009 and 2008.
 
Inventories
 
Inventories consist of handsets and accessories held for sale.  Inventories are carried at the lower of cost
or market.  Cost is determined using the specific identification method.  Market is determined by using the replacement cost.
 
Property, Plant and Equipment
 
Property, plant and equipment primarily represents costs incurred to construct and expand capacity and network coverage on mobile telephone switching offices and cell sites and are stated at original cost.  The costs of additions, replacements and substantial improvements that extend the life of the property, plant and equipment are capitalized, while the costs of maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.  Assets under construction primarily represent the costs incurred for the construction of cell sites and mobile telephone switching offices, and include allocations of capitalized interest, direct labor and related overhead costs incurred by the Parent on behalf of the Markets.  Transfers of property, plant and equipment with affiliates are recorded at net book value on the date of transfer.  Plant retirements are recorded at net book value plus salvage value, if any, with the corresponding gain or loss reflected in operating results.  In connection with the Acquisition, the Markets recorded a write-down of $117.7 million in the carrying value of their property, plant and equipment to reflect VZW's post-acquisition basis in these assets.  In connection with the Merger, the Markets recorded a write-up of $24.7 million in the carrying value of their property, plant and equipment to fair value.
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:
 
 
The Parent, on behalf of the Markets, periodically evaluates the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and, when appropriate, changes are made on a prospective basis.
 
Valuation of Assets
 
Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.  The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  The impairment loss, if determined to be necessary, would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.
 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 
Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired through various business combinations.  The accounting standard relating to useful life of intangible assets requires goodwill to be assigned to an entity's reporting units and tested for impairment annually using a consistent measurement date.  During the Successor period, as a result of the Acquisition and subsequent push-down of VZW's basis in the Markets, no goodwill was recorded in the combined financial statements of the Markets.  Conversely, during the Predecessor II period, goodwill was assigned to the Markets based on a five-part equally weighted metric, which consisted of customers, property plant and equipment, cellular licenses, revenue, and earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization, integration expenses, restructuring and other charges.
 
The Markets' operations consist of a single reporting unit, wireless communications services.  The impairment test for goodwill requires a two-step approach, which is performed at a reporting unit level.  Step one of the test identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount.  Step two, which is only performed if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, calculates the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill and the implied fair value of that goodwill.  For the Predecessor II period, the Markets' measurement date for performing the annual impairment review of goodwill was December 31
st
 of each year.  The Markets completed step one of the annual impairment reviews of goodwill and determined that no write-downs in the carrying value of goodwill was required as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.
 
Identifiable intangible assets include both cellular and Personal Communications Services ("PCS") licenses, (collectivelythe "wireless licenses"), issued by the FCC.  For both the Predecessor II and Successor periods, the Parent's cost basis of the licenses was assigned based on the divested market's proportionate size using the respective population of customers and MegaHertz capacity as metrics. The Markets determined that the wireless licenses in both the Predecessor II and Successor periods met the indefinite life criteria outlined in the accounting standard relating to useful life of intangible assets,
 
 
because the Markets expect both the renewal by the granting authorities and the cash flows generated from these intangible assets to continue indefinitely.  In addition, the Markets have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic, or other factors that would limit the useful life of the wireless licenses.  In accordance with the accounting standard relating to useful life of intangible assets, goodwill and the wireless licenses are not amortized.  Similar to goodwill, the accounting standard relating to useful life of intangible assets requires intangible assets with indefinite lives to be tested for impairment on an annual basis, by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amounts.
  The Markets' measurement date for performing the annual impairment review of wireless licenses is December 31
st
 of each year.  Upon completing the annual impairment reviews of the wireless licenses, the Markets determined that no write-down in the carrying value of these assets was required as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. 
The Markets used a market approach to complete the annual impairment reviews of the wireless licenses.  In applying this approach, the Markets estimate fair value of the wireless licenses using market data from recent transactions involving wireless spectrum.  These inputs are considered Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy, because they are based on data observable in the marketplace.
 
For the Successor and Predecessor II periods, other intangible assets included customer lists representing the value of the Markets' customers.  In both the Successor and Predecessor II periods, customer lists were amortized using the sum-of-the-years digits method over their estimated useful life of 8 years.
 
In the Predecessor I period, substantially all of Alltel's customer lists, which represented the value of customers of acquired businesses only, were amortized using the sum-of-the-years digits method over their estimated useful lives, which were 5 to 8 years.  The remaining customer lists were amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which were 3 to 5 years.  Customer lists were allocated to the Markets based on the Markets' number of customers as a proportion of total customers acquired.
 
Asset Retirement Obligations
 
Certain of the Markets' cell site and switch site operating lease agreements contain clauses requiring restoration of the leased site at the end of the lease term.  Similarly, certain of the Markets' lease agreements for retail locations require restoration of the leased site upon expiration of the lease term.  Accordingly, the Markets are subject to asset retirement obligations associated with assets constructed on these leased facilities under the provisions of the accounting standard relating to
accounting for asset retirement obligations.  The Markets record at fair value the liability
associated with asset retirement obligations in the period in which it is incurred, and capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying value of the related long-lived asset.  The liability is then accreted to its present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset.  Upon settlement of the liability, the Markets will either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or recognize a gain or loss.  The asset retirement obligations are not material to the Markets.
 
Financial Instruments
 
The Markets' financial instruments, which consist of trade receivables (net of allowance for doubtful accounts) and trade accounts payable, are short-term in nature.  Accordingly, management has estimated that the carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value.
 
 
Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments
 
At December 31, 2009 and 2008, two of the Markets' consolidated non-wholly owned partnerships have finite lives specified in their partnership agreements, and accordingly, are legally required to be dissolved and terminated at a specified future date with the proceeds distributed to the partners.  Under the provisions
of the accounting standard relating to
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity, the noncontrolling interests associated with these partnerships are considered mandatorily redeemable financial instruments, which should continue to be reported at carrying value in the Markets' combined financial statements.  Entities are required to disclose the estimated settlement value of the noncontrolling interests at each balance sheet date.  The estimated settlement value and carrying value of the noncontrolling interests associated with the Markets' finite-lived partnerships were as follows at December 31:
 
 
Concentrations
 
To the extent the Markets' customer accounts receivable become delinquent, collection activities commence.  No single customer is large enough to present a significant financial risk to the Markets.  The Markets maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the expected collectibility of customer accounts receivable.
 
The Markets rely on local and long-distance telephone companies, some of whom are related parties (see Note
14
), and other companies to provide certain communications services.  Although management believes alternative telecommunications facilities could be found in a timely manner, any disruption of these services could potentially have a material adverse affect on the Markets' operating results.
 
Although the Markets maintain multiple vendors for each required product, network assets, which are important components of their operations, are currently acquired from only a few sources.  If the suppliers are unable to provide network equipment on a timely basis, the Markets may be unable to provide services to their customers in a competitive manner or continue to maintain and upgrade their networks.  Any such disruption could result in increased costs, a decrease in operating efficiencies and a potential loss of customers, which could have a material adverse affect on the Markets' operating results.
 
Net Parent Investment
 
The Markets' equity on the combined balance sheets represents the Parent's net investment in the Markets and is presented as "Net parent investment" in lieu of stockholders' equity.  Changes in Net parent investment include net cash transfers and other property transfers to and from the Parent and the Markets. The Parent performs cash management and other treasury-related functions on a centralized basis for nearly all of its operating entities, which includes the Markets.  Amounts not specifically identifiable to the Markets are reflected in the Net parent investment account and include:
 
                 
Intercompany receivables and payables between the Markets and other Parent affiliates that were settled on a current basis.
                 
Accrued liabilities related to corporate allocations including administrative expenses for legal, accounting, treasury, information technology, human resources and other services.
 
                 
Other assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded by the Parent which have been pushed down to the Markets as such amounts related to the Markets' operations, including purchase accounting adjustments and expenses related to the Acquisition and the Merger.
 
All intercompany transactions effected through the Markets' Net parent investment in the accompanying combined balance sheets have been considered cash receipts and payments for purposes of the combined statements of cash flows and are reflected in financing activities in the accompanying combined statements of cash flows.
 
Earnings per share data has not been presented in the accompanying combined financial statements because the Markets do not operate as a separate legal entity with their own capital structure.
 
For the Predecessor I and II periods, the Markets earned interest on receivables from the Parent and were charged interest on payables to the Parent based on current market interest rates.  VZW does not record interest on intercompany receivables and payables between its affiliates and the Markets.  Accordingly, no intercompany interest is reflected in the combined financial statements subsequent to January 8, 2009.  During the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009, the average net intercompany receivable balance was $24.4 million.
 
Revenue Recognition
 
Service revenues are primarily derived from providing access to and usage of the Markets' networks and facilities.  Access revenues from postpaid customers are generally billed one month in advance and are recognized over the period that the corresponding service is rendered to customers.  Revenues derived from usage of the Markets' networks, including airtime, roaming and long-distance revenues, are recognized when the services are provided and are included in unbilled revenues until billed to the customer.  Prepaid airtime sold to customers is recorded as deferred revenue prior to the commencement of services and is recognized when the airtime is used or expires.  The Markets offer enhanced services including caller identification, call waiting, call forwarding, three-way calling, voice mail, and text and picture messaging, as well as downloadable wireless data applications, including ringtones, music, games, and other informational content.  Generally, these enhanced features generate additional service revenues through monthly subscription fees or increased usage through utilization of the features.  Other optional services, such as mobile-to-mobile calling, roadside assistance, and equipment protection plans may also be provided for a monthly fee and are either sold separately or bundled and included in packaged rate plans.  Revenues from enhanced features and optional services are recognized when earned.  Access and usage-based services are billed throughout the month based on the bill cycle assigned to a particular customer.  As a result of billing cycle cut-off times, management must estimate service revenues earned but not yet billed at the end of each reporting period.
  Service revenues, excluding wholesale revenues, for the embedded markets are allocated based on the divested portion of the embedded markets' customers in relation to the total customers for the operating entity.  Such allocation was necessary because customer specific billing information is either not readily available or would be cost prohibitive to accumulate by customer for each of the embedded markets.
 
Wholesale revenues are those revenues generated from providing voice or data services to the customers of other wireless carriers.  Wholesale revenues are specifically identifiable at a market level, and therefore, no allocation was required.  Other revenues, including Universal Service Fund support, were allocated to the Markets based on several allocation methods dependent on the type of revenue (number of customers, phone location, equipment sales per location, and GSM percentages).
Sales and use and state excise taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities are reported on a net basis and excluded from revenues and sales.
 
Operating Expenses
 
Operating expenses include costs of services and equipment, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.  These costs are either incurred directly by the Markets, or allocated to the Markets as a result of the costs being incurred by the Parent or its affiliates on behalf of the Markets.  Operating expenses for the embedded markets, if not specifically identified, were allocated primarily based on the divested portion of the embedded markets' customers in relation to the total customers for the operating entity.  Employees of the Parent and its affiliates perform services on behalf of the Markets.  As these employees are not directly employed by the Markets, operating expenses include direct and allocable charges of salary andother salary-related costs for these services.  See Note
14
for additional discussion of allocated costs and related party transactions.
 
Shipping and handling costs for wireless handsets and accessories sold to third-party agents and other distributors are classified as cost of products sold.  Business taxes and bad debt expense are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses within the combined statements of operations.
 
Advertising
 
The Parent and the Markets incur advertising costs to attract and retain customers through a broad array of programs.  A
dvertising costs are expensed as incurred
when the advertising is exhibited or aired.  Advertising expenses incurred by the Parent
were primarily allocated to the Markets based on the Markets' number of potential customers, or POPs.  Advertising expenses were $14.6 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.3 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009;
$13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $1.9 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $11.3 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.
 
Operating Leases
 
The Markets lease office spacecellular towers and real estate under operating leases.  Certain of the Markets' operating lease agreements for cell sites and for office and retail locations include scheduled rent escalations during the initial lease term and/or during succeeding optional renewal periods.  The Parent accounts for these operating leases in accordance with the accounting standard relating to accounting for leases and accounting for operating leases with scheduled rent increases.  Accordingly, the scheduled increases in rent expense are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured.  For those embedded markets for which an allocation was necessary, the allocation was based on the divested number of cell sites as a percentage of total operating entities' cell sites.
,
 
Income Taxes
 
The Parent and their domestic subsidiaries, including the Markets, file a consolidated federal income tax return.  As such, the Markets are not separate taxable entities for federal and state income tax purposes.  In addition, the Markets do not have a tax sharing arrangement with the Parent.  Income taxes as presented herein attribute current and deferred income taxes of the Parent to the Markets in a manner that is systematic, rational and consistent with the asset and liability method prescribed by the accounting standard relating to accounting for income taxes.  Accordingly, the Markets' income tax provisions are
 
 
prepared under the "separate return method."  The separate return method represents a hypothetical computation assuming that the reported revenue and expenses of the Markets were incurred by a separate taxable entity.  Accordingly, the sum of the income tax amounts attributed to the Markets may not equal the historical consolidated provision.
 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of the existing assets and liabilities, and their respective income tax bases.  The Markets establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  As discussed in Note 11, the Markets adopted the accounting standard relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as of January 1, 2007.  This standard requires the Markets' tax positions to be evaluated under a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement analysis before they can be recognized for financial statement reporting.  The adoption of the accounting standard relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes did not have a material impact on the Markets' combined financial statements.

The Markets conduct their wireless voice and data communications business as a single operating segment.
 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
 
On January 1, 2009, the Markets adopted the accounting standard relating to business combinations, including assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies.  This standard requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting, defines the acquirer, establishes the acquisition date and applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses.  This standard also requires entities to expense certain transaction costs and related fees associated with business combinations that were previously capitalized.  In addition, with the adoption of this standard, changes to valuation allowances for acquired deferred income tax assets and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits acquired generally are to be recognized as adjustments to income tax expense rather than goodwill.
 
On January 1, 2009, the Markets adopted the new accounting standard relating to noncontrolling interests, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the retained interest and gain or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated.  As required by this standard, the Markets have classified the noncontrolling interest, which was previously referred to as minority interest, as equity in the combined balance sheets and have separately presented net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest within the combined statements of operations for all periods presented.
 
The adoption of the following accounting standards and updates during 2009 did not result in a significant impact to the Markets' combined financial statements.
 
 
On January 1, 2009, the Markets adopted the accounting standard regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets that removes the requirement to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modifications to the existing terms and conditions, and replaces it with a requirement that an entity consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements, or a consideration of market participant assumptions in the absence of historical experience.  This standard also requires entities to disclose information that enables users of financial statements to assess the extent to which the expected future cash flows associated with the asset are affected by the entity's intent and/or ability to renew or extend the arrangements.
 
On July 1, 2009, the Markets prospectively adopted the accounting standard regarding the general standards of accounting for, and disclosure of, events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued.
 
In September 2009, the accounting standard regarding multiple deliverable arrangements was updated to require the use of the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in these types of arrangements.  This method allows a vendor to use its best estimate of selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists when evaluating multiple deliverable arrangements.  This standard update must be adopted no later than January 1, 2011 and may be adopted prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption or retrospectively for all revenue arrangements for all periods presented.  The Markets are currently evaluating the impact this standard update will have on their combined financial statements.
 
In September 2009, the accounting standard regarding arrangements that include software elements was updated to require tangible products that contain software and non-software elements that work together to deliver the products essential functionality to be evaluated under the accounting standard regarding multiple deliverable arrangements.  This standard update must be adopted no later than January 1, 2011 and may be adopted prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption or retrospectively for all revenue arrangements for all periods presented.  Early adoption is permitted only at the beginning of the company's fiscal year.  The Markets are currently evaluating the impact this standard update will have on their combined financial statements.

ACQUISITION OF ALLTEL BY VZW (SUCCESSOR)
 
As previously discussed in Note 1, on January 9, 2009, Alltel was acquired by VZW, pursuant to the terms of a merger
agreement
dated June 5, 2008.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, VZW acquired the equity of Alltel for approximately $5.9 billion in cash and assumed Alltel's outstanding long-term debt.  VZW acquired from third parties $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of debt obligations of a subsidiary of Alltel for approximately $4.8 billion, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  Upon completion of the Acquisition, Alltel became a wholly-owned subsidiary of VZW.
 
VZW accounted for the Acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method.  The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the income, cost and market approaches.  The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market.  The income approach was primarily used to value the customer lists intangible asset.  The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated by the asset.  Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money.  The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was determined as appropriate for property, plant and equipment.  The cost
to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.  The market approach, which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets, was utilized for valuing wireless licenses, certain acquired investments and the noncontrolling interest.  In determining fair value of the noncontrolling interest, the market approach indicates value based on financial multiples available for similar entities in the wireless industry and adjustments for the lack of control or lack of marketability that market participants would consider in estimating fair value.
 
As a result of the Acquisition and subsequent push-down of VZW's basis in the Markets, adjustments to establish the new accounting basis have been recorded to the Markets' tangible and intangible assets.  At the date of acquisition, the weighted average period prior to the renewal of the wireless licenses was approximately 3.5 years.  The change in the net assets of the Markets resulting from the Acquisition has been classified as a non-cash transaction, and accordingly, has been excluded from the combined statements of cash flows for the Successor period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009.
 
The following table summarizes the opening combined balance sheet of the Markets, reflecting the push-down of VZW's basis in the Markets at the date of the Acquisition:
 
 
 
4. ACQUISITION OF ALLTEL BY TWO PRIVATE INVESTMENT FIRMS
 
As previously discussed in Note 1, on November 16, 2007, Alltel was acquired by Atlantis Holdings.  The acquisition was completed through the merger of Atlantis Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlantis Holdings, with and into Alltel, with Alltel surviving the Merger as a privately-held, majority-owned subsidiary of Atlantis Holdings.  Although Alltel continued as the same legal entity after the Merger, Atlantis Holdings' cost of acquiring Alltel has been pushed-down to establish a new accounting basis for Alltel.
 
Alltel accounted for the Merger as a purchase in accordance with the accounting standard relating to business combinations.  Under the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price was allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill.  In connection with the purchase price allocation, Alltel recorded purchase accounting adjustments to increase the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment and investments in unconsolidated wireless partnerships to establish intangible assets for its wireless licenses, trademarks and trade-names, customer list, non-compete agreement and favorable roaming agreement and to revalue its long-term debt and benefit plan obligations. As a result of the Merger, adjustments to establish the new accounting basis have been allocated to the Markets' tangible and intangible assets.  The change in the net assets of the Markets resulting from the Merger has been classified as a non-cash transaction, and accordingly, has been excluded from the combined statements of cash flows for the Predecessor II period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007.
 
 
The following table summarizes the opening combined balance sheet of the Markets, including the application of purchase accounting adjustments, to record the acquisition of assets and liabilities at fair value at the date of the Merger:

7.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES
 
Goodwill
 
As a result of the Acquisition and subsequent push-down of VZW's basis to the Markets, no goodwill was recorded in the combined financial statements of the Markets during the Successor period.
 
As a result of the Merger and push-down of Atlantis Holdings' cost basis to the Markets, goodwill of $690.6 million was allocated to the Markets.  There were no changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009 and during the year ended December 31, 2008.  Accordingly, the carrying value of goodwill remained $690.6 million at January 8, 2009 and December 31, 2008.
 
Other Intangible Assets
 
Carrying value of the Markets' indefinite-lived intangible assets (other than goodwill) was as follows as of December 31:
 
 
 
Intangible assets subject to amortization consist of customer lists.  The carrying value was as follows as of December 31:
 
 
Amortization expense was $3.3 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.7 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $4.2 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $7.5 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.  Amortization expense is estimated to be $3.0 million in 2010, $2.5 million in 2011, $2.1 million in 2012, $1.7 million in 2013 and $1.3 million in 2014.

INTEGRATION EXPENSES, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES
 
Successor period costs allocated to the Markets
 
During the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009, VZW incurred $180.2 million of incremental costs relating to the Acquisition that were allocable to the Markets.  Included in these costs were investment banking and legal fees of $79.2 million; employee severance and outplacement costs of $87.5 million; contract termination fees of $6.0 million; external accounting and auditing fees of $6.4 million incurred in connection with these combined financial statements, and other miscellaneous charges of $1.1 million.  Of the total costs incurred by VZW during the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009, the Markets were allocated $15.9 million of these costs.  Except for the external accounting and auditing fees which were fully allocated to the Markets, the remaining costs were allocated to the Markets based on the proportion of the Markets' customers as a percentage of the total customers acquired by VZW in the Acquisition.
 
Predecessor II period costs allocated to the Markets
 
During the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009, Alltel incurred $186.4 million of incremental costs associated with its pending acquisition by VZW that were allocable to the Markets.  These costs principally consisted of $135.3 million in
additional compensation-related costs, primarily related to change-in-control payments to certain executives, bonus payments and related payroll taxes; stock-based compensation expense of $40.1 million related to the settlement of employee stock option awards;
and professional and legal fees of $11.0 million.  Of the total costs incurred by Alltel during the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009, the Markets were allocated $9.8 million of these costs.
 
During 2008, Alltel incurred $12.9 million of incremental expenses related to its participation in the 700 MHz spectrum auction conducted by the FCC that was completed on March 18, 2008.  Alltel did not obtain any licenses in the 700 MHz spectrum auction.  The auction-related expenses primarily consisted of consulting fees and estimated bid withdrawal payments to be remitted to the FCC as a result of Alltel withdrawing certain bids made during the course of its participation in the auction.  In connection with the Merger, Alltel incurred $8.9 million of incremental costs, primarily consisting of $4.0 million in employee retention bonuses, legal and accounting fees of $2.4 million and a settlement charge of $2.0 million resulting from the payout of supplemental medical benefits to certain executives.  Alltel also recorded severance and employee benefit costs of $2.1 million related to various planned workforce reductions.
In connection with its pending acquisition by VZW, Alltel incurred $20.5 million of incremental costs during 2008, principally consisting of $14.9 million in supplemental bonuses earned by certain employees in readying Alltel's financial and operational support systems to accommodate the divestiture requirements of the Acquisition.  The VZW acquisition-related costs also included financial advisory, legal and regulatory filing fees of $3.9 million.
 
T
he Markets were allocated $2.2 million of the total integration expenses, restructuring and other charges
of $44.4 million incurred
by Alltel during the
year ended December 31, 2008, as discussed above.
 
During the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007, Alltel incurred $5.2 million of incremental expenses related to the Merger, which included insurance premiums of $4.2 million to obtain retroactive coverage for departing directors and officers for events that occurred prior to the Merger and $1.0 million in employee retention bonuses.
  Of the total costs incurred by Alltel, t
he Markets were allocated $0.3 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007.
 
Predecessor I period costs allocated to the Markets
 
During the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007, Alltel incurred $12.0 million of integration expenses related to its 2006 acquisitions of Midwest Wireless Holdings and properties in Illinois, Texas and Virginia consisting of $6.6 million in computer system conversion and other integration costs and $5.4 million in branding and signage costs.  The system conversion and other integration expenses primarily consisted of internal payroll, contracted services and other programming costs incurred in converting the acquired properties to Alltel's customer billing and operational support systems, a process that Alltel completed during the fourth quarter of 2007.  In connection with the closing of two call centers, Alltel also recorded severance and employee benefit costs of $4.5 million and lease termination fees of $2.6 million.
 
In connection with the Merger, Alltel incurred $647.9 million of incremental costs, which included financial advisory, legal, accounting, regulatory filing, and other fees of $177.6 million, stock-based compensation expense of $63.8 million related to the accelerated vesting of employee stock option and restricted stock awards, a curtailment charge of $118.6 million resulting from the termination and payout of the supplemental executive retirement plan, and additional compensation-related costs of $287.9 million primarily related to change-in-control payments to certain executives, bonus payments and related payroll taxes.  Included in the amounts listed above are consulting fees of $75.6 million paid to affiliates of the two private investment firms and attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with the settlement of certain shareholder lawsuits.
 
Of the total integration expenses, restructuring and other charges
of $667.0 million
incurred by Alltel during the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007
as discussed above
, the Markets were allocated $34.5 million of these costs.
 
Integration, restructuring and other charges for both the Predecessor I and II periods were allocated to the operating entities comprised of non-embedded markets based on a four part formula consisting of potential customers, revenues, net property, plant and equipment, and number of customers.  For the embedded markets, allocated charges were based on the pro-rata number of customers after the charges were first allocated to their respective operating entity.

INCOME TAXES
 
As previously discussed in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies", the income tax provision included in the Markets' financial statements is accounted for as if the Markets were a separate entity and standalone filer in their respective tax jurisdictions.  Furthermore, the Markets' income tax amounts have been calculated assuming the Markets will continue as a going concern and do not reflect the impact of the sale of the Markets to ATN as discussed in Note 15.  Finally, the combined financial statements do not reflect any amounts due to the Parent for income tax related matters as it is assumed that all such amounts due the Parent have been settled on December 31
st
 of each year.
 
Income Tax Provision
 
The following table summarizes income tax expense (benefit):
 
 
Federal and state deferred tax expense for the Successor period of 2009 increased compared to the Predecessor II period of 2008 due to bonus tax depreciation taken on fixed assets placed in service subsequent to January 9, 2009, as well as the reductions in property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets resulting from the push-down of VZW's post-acquisition basis in the Markets, as further discussed in Note 3.  Current and deferred income taxes for the Predecessor II period of 2008 reflect timing differences between the amounts recorded in the financial statements and reported for income tax purposes primarily related to depreciation and amortization expense.  The timing differences include the effects of purchase accounting adjustments allocated to the Markets' tangible and intangible assets, as further discussed in Note 4.
Effective and Statutory Rate Reconciliation
 
The following table summarizes a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the Markets' effective tax rate, as a percentage of income (loss) before income taxes:
 
Deferred Income Taxes
 
The following table summarizes the deferred income tax assets and liabilities, at December 31:
 
 
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.  These items are stated at the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.  In addition, as discussed in Note 14, certain corporate allocations were pushed-down to the carve-out financial statements, without corresponding assets / liabilities.  In such cases, the related deferred tax liability (or deferred tax asset, if applicable) is deemed to remain with the Parent and is not recorded by the Markets.  As a result of the push-down of VZW's post-acquisition basis in the Markets, deferred tax liabilities associated with customer lists and partnership investments as of December 31, 2008 became deferred tax assets in 2009.  No valuation allowances have been recorded with respect to the deferred tax assets as the Markets believe that it is more likely than not that the Markets' deferred tax assets will be realized.
 
Uncertain Tax Positions
 
As previously discussed in Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," effective January 1, 2007, Alltel adopted the accounting standard relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.  This standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return.
 
Upon audit, taxing authorities may challenge all or part of an uncertain income tax position.  While the Markets have no history of tax audits on a standalone basis, the Parent is routinely audited by federal and
state taxing authorities.  Accordingly, the Parent and the Markets regularly assess the outcome of potential examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded.  The reserves are adjusted, from time to time, based upon changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit.  The effective income tax rate reflects changes to the tax contingency reserves that the Markets consider appropriate, as well as related interest charges.  However, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact the Markets' unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty.
 
The Markets' most significant tax jurisdiction is the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction.  The audits related to Alltel's federal income tax returns for the 2004 and 2005 tax years were settled with the IRS in February 2008.  As of December 31, 2009, the audits and/or statutes of limitations applicable to Alltel's federal income tax returns for the tax years 2006 through 2009 remained open.  The open tax years applicable to Alltel's state income tax jurisdictions range from 2002 to 2009.  VZW's federal and state income tax returns for 2009 also remain open as of December 31, 2009.
 
The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the Markets' gross unrecognized tax benefits:
 
 
Approximately $1.3 million of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 would, if recognized, affect the Markets' effective rate in future periods.  As of December 31, 2009, the Markets believed that it was reasonably possible that approximately $1.5 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, related to deductibility issues, would reverse in the following twelve months. In connection with the uncertain tax positions, interest charges on potential assessments and any penalties assessed by taxing authorities are classified as income tax expense within the Markets' statement of operations.  The Markets have accrued $0.1 million for interest related to its gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2009.  No amounts were accrued for the payment of penalties during 2009 or 2008.  The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in "Other non-current liabilities" in the accompanying combined balance sheets.
12.
COMMITMENTS
 
In 2000, Alltel signed a definitive agreement with American Tower Corporation ("American Tower") to lease to American Tower certain of Alltel's cell site towers, including 190 towers owned by the Markets, in exchange for cash paid in advance.  Under terms of the fifteen-year lease agreement, American Tower assumed responsibility to manage, maintain and remarket the remaining space on the towers, while the Markets maintained ownership of the cell site facilities.  The Markets are obligated to pay American Tower a monthly fee for management and maintenance services for the duration of the agreement amounting to $1,200 per tower per month, subject to escalation not to exceed five percent annually.  American Tower has the option to purchase the towers for additional consideration totaling $42,844 per tower in cash or, at Alltel's election, 769 shares of American Tower Class A common stock per tower at the end of the lease term.  Proceeds from this leasing transaction were recorded by the Markets as deferred rental income and had been recognized as service revenues on a straight-line basis over the fifteen-year lease term.  As of the closing date of the Merger, the Markets eliminated the remaining deferred rental income and the corresponding amount of deferred leasing costs in accordance with the accounting standard relating to accounting in a business combination for deferred revenue of an acquiree, because the Markets had no legal performance obligations associated with these deferred balances.  For income tax purposes, the deferred rental income and related deferred leasing costs continue to be amortized over the remaining lease term.  Because Atlantis Holdings had assumed an obligation to continue to grant American Tower the right to use the towers for the duration of the lease agreement, without receiving any future cash inflows, the Markets recorded an unfavorable contract obligation of $5.6 million as of November 16, 2007.  In connection with the Acquisition and VZW's assumption of this obligation, the Markets recorded a write-up of $10.6 million in order to adjust the carrying value of the American Tower liability to reflect the push-down of VZW's assigned fair value.  The unamortized portion of the unfavorable American Tower contract obligation, which is being amortized over the remaining lease term, was as follows at December 31:
 
 
In addition, the Markets entered into operating leases for facilities and equipment used in its operations.  Future minimum payments required under operating leases for real estate, office space, tower space, and network capacity that have non-cancelable lease terms as of December 31, 2009 are as follows (in thousands):
 
These leases permit renewals at various intervals with provisions for increased rentals at each renewal.  In connection with the Acquisition, the Markets recorded an unfavorable
contract obligation of $8.6 million related to network operating lease agreements, which is being amortized as an adjustment to rental expense over the weighted average remaining lease term.  As of December 31, 2009, the unamortized balance was $7.1 million and is included in
"Other non-current liabilities" in the accompanying combined balance sheet.  Rental expense for operating leases was $14.1 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.3 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $1.5 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $10.4 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.

CONTINGENCIES
 
VZW is subject to various pending lawsuits and other claims, including such matters as class actions and claims relating to product liability, patent infringement, intellectual property, antitrust, partnership disputes, and relations with resellers and agents.  VZW is also defending lawsuits filed against VZW and other participants in the wireless industry alleging adverse health effects as a result of wireless phone usage.  Various consumer class action lawsuits allege that VZW violated certain state consumer protection laws and other statutes and defrauded customers through misleading billing practices or statements.  Certain of these lawsuits and other claims may impact the Markets.  These litigation matters may involve indemnification obligations by third parties and/or insurance coverage covering all or part of any potential damage awards against VZW.  All of the above matters are subject to many uncertainties, and outcomes are not predictable with assurance.  Consequently, VZW cannot determine the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits at this time.
 
The Markets are not a separate legal entity.  As such, it has not been party to any legal proceedings.  However, any adverse effect from the various legal actions and claims against VZW could have an impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Markets.  Therefore, the Markets may be allocated a portion of any damages that may result upon the adjudication of these matters if the claimants prevail in their actions.  Consequently, the ultimate liability to the Markets with respect to these legal matters cannot be determined as of December 31, 2009.  The potential effects, if any, on the combined financial statements of the Markets will be recorded in the period in which the outcome for these matters becomes probable and estimable, and such effects, could be material.
 
In addition to the aforementioned matters, VZW is party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.  Although the ultimate resolution of these various proceedings cannot be determined at this time, VZW's management does not believe that such proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the combined financial statements of the Markets.
 
On August 7, 2009, Bulloch Cellular, Inc.; Pineland Cellular, Inc.; Planters Rural Cellular, Inc.; and Plant Cellular RSA 8, Inc. (collectively, the "Plaintiffs") filed a lawsuit against Alltel Communications, LLC ("ACLLC"), related to each of the partner's right-of-first-refusal ("ROFR") to purchase its pro rata share of Alltel's 33.33% interest in the Georgia RSA 8 Partnership, which comprises the sole unconsolidated partnership investment pertaining to the Markets. 
In their lawsuit, the Plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement,
their ROFR allowed them to purchase not only Alltel's interest in the Georgia RSA 8 Partnership but also VZW's interest in several other Georgia properties that are being sold to ATN.  On March 26, 2010, the Plaintiffs and ACLLC entered into an agreement to settle the ongoing litigation and all disputes and issues related to VZW's sale of the Markets to ATN.  Pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement and in consideration of the Plaintiffs' waiver of their rights under the ROFR with respect to the proposed sale of the Georgia RSA 8 Partnership
interest to ATN, ACLLC has agreed to make a total lump sum payment of $4.3 million to the Plaintiffs, with each plaintiff receiving one-fourth of the total amount.  The cash payment to the Plaintiffs is contingent upon the closing of the sale of the Markets to ATN, and accordingly, no provision for the payment has been recorded in the accompanying combined financial statements as of December 31, 2009.
 
Upon completion of the sale of the Markets,
Atlantic Wireless Communications Corporation ("AWCC"), a subsidiary of ATN, will assume responsibility for managing and operating the Georgia RSA 8 Partnership, pursuant to a partnership management agreement dated January 1, 2004.
 
Under terms of the settlement agreement, the
Georgia RSA 8 Partnership is entitled to receive certain operational support services directly from VZW in the event that AWCC terminates the
management agreement prior to the end of the term of the transition services agreement between VZW and ATN (see Note 15).  Furthermore, in the event that the management agreement is terminated within 10 years of the effective date of the sale of the Markets to ATN, upon written request from the partners, VZW will enter into a roaming agreement with the Georgia RSA 8 Partnership, at the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the most recent roaming agreement between VZW and ATN in effect at the time that the management agreement is terminated. 
Concurrent with the settlement agreement, the Plaintiffs and AWCC agreed to amend
the partnership management agreement.  The amendment provides, among other things, that the
Georgia RSA 8 Partnership is entitled to receive certain transitional support services including the use of certain trademarks for a specified period of time in the event that the
management agreement is terminated by either AWCC or the
Georgia RSA 8 Partnership.
 The effectiveness of the amendment is also contingent upon the closing of the sale of the Markets to ATN.

RELATIONSHIP WITH PARENT, TRUST AND RELATED ENTITIES
 
Historically, the Markets were managed and operated in the normal course of business with other affiliates of Alltel.  As previously discussed in Note 1, on January 9, 2009, the Markets were transferred to a court-appointed Trust and operate as a part of VZW, under the oversight of the Trust.  As a result, certain revenues and costs have been allocated to the Markets and reflected as revenues or expenses in the standalone combined financial statements.  Management of the Markets consider the allocation methodologies used to be reasonable and appropriate reflections of the related revenues and expenses attributable to the Markets for purposes of the carve-out financial statements; however, the revenues and expenses reflected in the Markets' combined financial statements may not be indicative of the actual revenues and expenses that would have been incurred during the periods presented if the Markets historically operated as a separate, standalone entity.  In addition, the revenues and expenses reflected in the combined financial statements may not be indicative of related revenues and expenses that will be incurred in the future by the Markets.
 
Cash Management
 
The Markets participate in the centralized cash management programs established by the Parent.  The Markets have small cash accounts to support operations outside the normal treasury function and have no other cash or cash equivalents.  Disbursements are made through centralized accounts payable systems which are operated by the Parent.  Cash receipts are transferred to centralized accounts, also maintained by the Parent.  As cash is disbursed and received by the Parent, it is accounted for by the Markets through Net parent investment.
Allocated Revenues and Costs
 
Prior to January 9, 2009, Alltel performed several administrative functions on behalf of the Markets and provided shared services as well as use of shared assets to the Markets.  Since January 9, 2009, the Trust provides the administrative functions to the Markets, while legacy Alltel companies continue to provide shared services and the use of shared assets to the Markets.
 
For the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009 and for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009, corporate costs have been allocated to the Markets based on number of customers or other specific allocation methodologies.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2008, for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007, and for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007, corporate costs have been allocated to the Markets based on either the four part formula consisting of potential customers, revenues, net property, plant and equipment, and number of customers or other specific allocation methodologies. For embedded markets, allocated charges were based on a pro-rata number of customers after first allocating the charges to the embedded market's respective operating entity for the period.
 
The allocated corporate costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the combined statements of operations amounted to $75.7 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $1.7 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $7.7 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $53.9 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.  The allocated corporate costs included in cost of services in the combined statements of operations amounted to $1.4 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.1 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $0.3 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $2.2 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.
 
Allocated corporate costs in selling, general and administrative expenses also include depreciation charges related to shared assets, as well as the Markets' proportionate share of amortization expense related to the trademarks and tradenames, non-compete agreement and roaming agreement intangible assets recorded by Alltel in connection with Alltel's merger with Atlantis Holdings and subsequently re-valued by VZW in connection with the Acquisition.  Allocated depreciation charges amounted to $4.4 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.2 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $1.3 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $8.9 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.  Allocated amortization expense related to the items discussed above amounted to $8.8 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.1 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; and $0.8 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007.  The Markets did not record amortization expense during the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007, because Alltel had not ascribed any value to its tradename prior to the Merger.
 
In addition to direct sales to customers, equipment sales and cost of products sold include an allocation representing sales of communications products to third party agents and national retailers. Sales to third party agents and the related equipment cost were allocated to the Markets based on agent-related gross customer additions, while sales to national retailers and the related equipment cost were allocated to the Markets based on prepaid gross customer additions.  Sales of communications products to third party agents and national retailers allocated to the Markets were $17.1 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.3 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $15.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2008; $1.0 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $10.7 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007. Cost of equipment related to sales to third party agents and national retailers were allocated the Markets in the same manner as the related revenues and totaled $26.0 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.6 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $1.5 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $13.4 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.
 
Affiliate Revenues and Affiliate Service Costs
 
The Markets have reciprocal roaming agreements with other operating entities managed by the Parent.  Under these agreements, the Markets recorded roaming revenue from affiliated cellular carriers related to the carriers' customers placing or receiving calls in the Markets' service area.  Roaming expenses represent costs charged by affiliated cellular carriers for the Markets' customers placing and receiving calls in the affiliates' service areas.
 
Subsequent to the Acquisition, transactions between the Markets and VZW became affiliated.  During the Predecessor periods, roaming charges between the Markets and VZW markets were accounted for as foreign roaming revenue.  During the Successor period, these charges were accounted for as revenue from affiliated cellular carriers.  Foreign roaming revenue relating to VZW markets amounted to $0.2 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009, $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $1.9 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $12.3 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.  Foreign roaming expense relating to VZW markets amounted to $0.2 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009, $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $0.9 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $6.2 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.
 
Other Affiliate Transactions
 
The Markets have agreements with certain affiliates for the provision of services in the normal course of business, including but not limited to direct and office telecommunications and general and administrative services.  In addition, the Markets purchase substantially all infrastructure, equipment and inventory from an affiliate.  Total purchases made by the Markets from this affiliate totaled $107.8 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $2.4 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $104.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $12.0 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $84.9 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.  The Markets also incur charges from affiliates for interconnection and toll services.  Charges incurred by the Markets from these affiliates totaled $8.5 million for the period January 9, 2009 to December 31, 2009; $0.2 million for the period January 1, 2009 to January 8, 2009; $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008; $1.3 million for the period November 16, 2007 to December 31, 2007; and $6.8 million for the period January 1, 2007 to November 15, 2007.  Intercompany receivables and payables between the Markets and related or affiliated companies have been accounted for through the Net parent investment account in the combined financial statements.
The Markets recorded transfers of property, plant and equipment, at net book value, to affiliates.  Similarly, the Markets recorded transfers of property, plant and equipment, at net book value, from affiliates.  The effects of these non-cash asset transfers have been accounted for through the Net parent investment account in the combined financial statements, and accordingly, are included in the net transfers from / to parent presented within the combined statements of Net parent investment.  A summary of these transfers to/from affiliates was as follows:

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
 
On April 26, 2010, VZW completed the sale of the Markets to ATN, pursuant to the terms of the June 9, 2009 sales agreement discussed in Note 1.  The total purchase price was $223 million in cash, which includes $23 million of acquired net working capital.  VZW and ATN have entered into a transition services agreement, the terms of which will
provide ATN with certain operational support services for a specified period of time at negotiated prices.  In addition, VZW will provide ATN with voice and data roaming services at negotiated rates in accordance with the terms of a roaming agreement entered into by the companies.
 
Subsequent events have been evaluated through May 7, 2010, the date of financial statement issuance.

Exhibit 99.2
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is provided for informational purposes only. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the financial position or results of operations of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company" or "ATN") or the Alltel Divested Markets ("Alltel"), acquired from Celco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless ("Verizon"), actually would have been if the acquisition of Alltel by the Company had been completed as of and for the periods indicated. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the Company after consummation of the acquisition.
 
Pro forma adjustments related to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements give effect to certain events that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition, (ii) factually supportable and (iii) expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. Pro forma adjustments related to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet give effect to events that are directly attributable to the Alltel acquisition, and that are factually supportable regardless of whether they have a continuing impact or are non-recurring.
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on a number of other assumptions and estimates and is subject to a number of uncertainties relating to the Alltel acquisition and related matters, including, among other things, estimates, assumptions and uncertainties regarding (1) the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities acquired, which are sensitive to assumptions and market conditions, (2) the actual amount of gain that will arise from the acquisition, (3) the amount of costs relating to the acquisition and transition period and (4) the amount of actual roaming revenue and expenses as well as the roaming patterns of subscribers under a disaggregated network. In particular, given the fact that the business and assets acquired were operated as part of a much larger separate business, the assumptions regarding the separation of the networks, retail service areas, and overall network coverage areas are complex and estimates of certain revenue and expense items are made with a greater degree of uncertainty than in many other business combinations and (5) the timing and amount of universal service fund payments to the Company for which the Company generally needs to re-qualify.
 
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared by the Company's management and gives pro forma effect to the completion of i) the acquisition by the Company of the assets and liabilities of Alltel and the non-controlling interests of certain subsidiaries of Alltel (the "Acquisition") and, ii) the application of the proceeds from the Company's new credit facility, entered into on January 20, 2010 (the "2010 Credit Facility").
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations combine the historical consolidated statements of operations of the Company and Alltel, giving effect to the Acquisition and the completion of the 2010 Credit Facility as if they had occurred on January 1, 2009. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of the Company and Alltel, giving effect to the Acquisition and the completion of the 2010 Credit Facility as if they had been consummated on December 31, 2009. You should read this unaudited pro forma information in conjunction with the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, the historical financial statements of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and historical financial statements of Alltel filed herein.
 
The Acquisition is treated herein as a purchase of Alltel by the Company, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, business combinations. Accordingly, a gain arising from the Acquisition has been determined as the excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired over the acquisition cost. In the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet, the Company's cost to acquire Alltel has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the Company's preliminary estimate of their respective fair values as of the date of the Acquisition.
 
Definitive allocations have not been completed and continue to be refined based upon certain valuations and other studies after the closing date of the Acquisition. Accordingly, the pro forma adjustments relating to the purchase price allocation are preliminary and have been made solely for the purpose of providing unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information and are subject to revision based on a final determination of fair value. Thus, the final purchase price allocation may differ in material respects from that presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations also include certain purchase accounting adjustments, including items expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results, such as decreased depreciation and amortization expense on acquired tangible and intangible assets.
 
Items Not Reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information
 
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements do not include the impacts of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies that may have resulted or may result in the future from the Acquisition. Therefore, certain revenue and expense amounts will likely be very different, both in total and as a percent of overall revenue and expense, in future periods even if the Company were to continue the exact same pricing, service scope, and subscriber levels as in the past.  For example, roaming revenue and expense, as disclosed in the Revenue-Affiliates and Affiliate service costs in the unaudited pro forma statement of operations, and many network operating expenses will likely be significantly different as a result of the disaggregation from the larger operating area and network.
 
Based on Atlantic Tele-Network Inc.'s review of the summary of significant accounting policies disclosed in the financial statements of Alltel, the nature and amount of any adjustments to the historical financial statements of Alltel to conform its accounting policies to those of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. are not expected to be significant. Further review of the accounting policies and financial statements of Alltel may result in revisions to the policies and classifications of Alltel in order to conform to the policies and classifications of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.
 
Both the Company and Alltel incurred certain expenses in the amount of $32.9 million in connection with the Acquisition. These expenses are not reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 as they were direct, incremental and non-
recurring
to the Acquisition and are not expected to have a continuing impact on operations.
 
 
 
 
(a)
         
Certain reclassifications have been made to the historical presentation of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. and Alltel to conform to the presentation used in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations.
 
(b)
        
Reflects the adjustment for the net proceeds from the 2010 Credit Facility and the use of the proceeds to fund the Acquisition:
 
(c)
         
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. has completed its preliminary assessment of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Alltel.  The table below represents a preliminary assessment of the total acquisition cost to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Alltel based on management's preliminary estimate of their acquisition date fair values:
 
 
The gain is not reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Operations since it is a nonrecurring charge, however is included in Retained Earnings within the Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet.
 
(d)
        
Affiliate revenues and affiliate service costs represent the effects of certain roaming arrangements between Verizon and Alltel that the Company expects to significantly change subsequent to the Acquisition.  Alltel anticipates receiving minimal roaming revenues from Verizon since we expect Verizon to optimize the use of their own network to reduce their roaming costs.  Meanwhile, we expect to continue incurring substantial roaming costs as Alltel subscribers roam into territories serviced by Verizon.
 
(e)
         
Reverses acquisition related costs since these costs are direct and incremental to the Acquisition and are not expected to be recurring.
 
(f)
           
Reflects the adjustment to depreciation and amortization of Alltel's tangible and intangible assets arising from their estimated fair values and useful lives.  The estimated depreciation and amortization, as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2009, are as follows:
 
 
 
(g)
        
To record additional interest expense at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.08% on the incremental borrowings identified in Note (b) above.  An increase in interest rates of .125% on our variable rate debt would increase the pro forma interest expense by $244 for the year ended December 31, 2009.
 
(h)
        
To record the reduction in interest income as a result of the pro forma reduction in cash as identified in Note (b) above.
 
(i)
            
To record income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of 39.6% on all pro forma adjustments above.
 
(j)
            
Alltel's historical financial statements include significant corporate allocations from its parent company, Verizon, which may not be incurred by Alltel, subsequent to the Acquisition.

Dear Lee:
 
I am delighted to offer you a position as Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. ("ATN").    You will report to the Chief Executive Officer.   You will have all typical duties of a company general counsel, including corporate governance, litigation and overall legal strategy, managing of legal expenses and you are also expected to be involved with our strategic transactions and financings.
 
This position is based in our corporate headquarters, soon to be located in Beverly Massachusetts.
 
Your initial base salary will be $225,000 per year, payable bi-weekly.  You will be eligible for an annual cash performance bonus at a target maximum level 40% of your base salary (pro-rated in the first year).  The bonus will be entirely discretionary and not earned until paid.
 
In addition, subject to approval of the ATN board at its June 2010 meeting, you will also receive an initial grant of ATN common stock options and/or restricted stock.  As discussed, I expect to recommend numbers consistent with other senior hires and that there would be a mix of restricted stock and options.   Any equity grant also will be subject to vesting and other customary restrictions and terms.  Our options typically vest at the rate of 25% a year for four years, although the compensation committee has considered "cliffs" recently, which might mean the first vesting is 50% after two years.   The underlying shares are registered on the NASDAQ Global market.
 
ATN has a history of providing very good benefits, including health, dental and 401(k) programs and you will generally be eligible to participate in all of those programs and benefits.  I believe you have already had a conversation with Justin outlining the current details of those benefit plans.
 
Vacation would be four weeks, but we have a "personal time off" plan which would mean the PTO days will be more than 20 and I believe you also have been given that information.  The PTO approach means that whether you are out for illness, personal day or vacation it is all treated the same.
 
This offer assumes you can start employment in May.   Let's discuss once you have thought through it further.
 
If you accept this offer, you will be an employee-at-will, which means that each of you and the Company are free to terminate the employment relationship at any time with or without cause.  None of the Company's current employees or executives have employment agreements, excluding officers of certain subsidiaries.
 
By joining the Company you are agreeing not to engage in any competitive work during your employment or within six months after leaving its employment, voluntarily or involuntarily.  For the purposes of this document, competitive work is defined as performing work for, or directly benefiting, competitors of the Company or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates.  You will also be expected to sign a basic employee confidentiality agreement.  The equity plans have further non-competition requirements.
 
I very much look forward to having you join the ATN team.  I am excited about the opportunities and believe that you will be a major contributor to the company's success.  Please call me with any questions.

Beverly, MA
(August 5, 2010)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010.
 
Second Quarter 2010 Financial Results
 
Total revenues for the second quarter were $164.4 million, of which total wireless revenues represented $133.6 million, or 81%. This significant increase over last year's second quarter total revenues of $60.4 million resulted from the Company's acquisition of certain former Alltel Wireless retail markets, licenses and network assets, which closed on April 26, 2010. U.S. wireless service revenues totaled $121.1 million, or 74% of total revenues, for the quarter.  The Company ended the quarter with approximately 1.1 million wireless subscribers.
 
Total operating income was $7.8 million. Adjusted to exclude $11.0 million in acquisition-related charges, operating income was $18.8 million, as compared to $18.5 million in the second quarter of 2009. Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2010 second quarter was $37.4 million as compared to $28.3 million in the second quarter of 2009, an increase of $9.1 million, or 32%.
 
Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $24.8 million, or $1.60 per diluted share.  This includes a one-time after-tax gain of $27.0 million associated with the bargain purchase of the Alltel assets. Excluding this gain and the acquisition-related charges, net income would have been $4.4 million or $0.28 per diluted share, as compared to $9.9 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2010 was negatively impacted by $5.2 million in write-offs of certain tax assets.
 
"The completion of the Alltel asset acquisition was a major milestone for our Company and in our strategy to provide high quality telecommunications services to traditionally underserved markets such as rural America. We are pleased with the progress that has been made to date in all critical transition areas and in supporting and further strengthening the Alltel brand in our markets," commented Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer.

See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
 
"The number of U.S. retail wireless subscribers at quarter-end was in line with our expectations.  We expect to continue to see some modest net attrition for the next few quarters as a result of re-targeted sales approaches and other actions we are taking as part of our transition of this business to align with our sales and marketing strategy and profitability requirements. Also, as anticipated, operating income from our U.S. wireless business was negatively affected by the higher costs associated with the transition services agreement to support the acquired Alltel assets. As we have previously stated, this cost overlap will cause EBITDA margins on the retail portion of our U.S. wireless business to be well below industry standards over the short term, but we anticipate achieving more normalized EBITDA margins by the middle of 2011."
 
Mr. Prior continued, "The wholesale side of our U.S. wireless revenues benefited from increased revenues related to the Alltel asset acquisition, but our legacy markets were relatively unchanged, mainly due to previous rate reductions. We expect to see a sequential wholesale revenue increase in the third quarter as a result of seasonal factors, overall traffic growth and the continued expansion of our footprint," Mr. Prior noted.
 
Highlights in our other businesses included:
                 
Our third stimulus award, a $33.4 million U.S. federal government grant to develop, own, maintain and operate a 773 mile fiber-optic middle mile network in rural Vermont.
                 
The launch of our wireless service in Turks and Caicos.
                 
Completion of our new undersea cable to Guyana, which will help us provide high-speed, capacity- redundant, data and internet services to a population of over 750,000.
 
Second Quarter 2010 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data services revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations.  Total service revenues from the U.S. Wireless businesses amounted to $121.1 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to $25.8 million in the second quarter of 2009. Total service revenues from the acquired Alltel properties since the April 26, 2010 close were $95.2 million, or the entirety of this increase.
 
Retail wireless service revenues
were $81.5 million for the quarter. The Company did not have a U.S. retail wireless business in the second quarter of 2009. At the end of the 2010 second quarter, the Company had approximately 807,000 U.S. retail subscribers, of which approximately 577,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 230,000 were prepaid subscribers. This excludes approximately 61,000 affiliate and wholesale subscribers. Additional operating data on our U.S. wireless business can be found in Table 4.
 
Wholesale wireless revenues
were $39.5 million, an increase of 53% over the $25.8 million reported in the 2009 second quarter. Wholesale revenues from the acquired Alltel properties since the April 26, 2010 close were $13.7 million, or the entirety of this increase.  Data revenues accounted for 24% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 18% a year earlier.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Guyana, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Total revenues from international wireless (which includes revenues from fixed wireless data services) amounted to $12.5 million in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of $1.1 million, or 10%, over $11.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2009.  This increase primarily resulted from growth in the number of wireless subscribers in Guyana.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of Guyana, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its
 
 
wholesale transport operations in New York state.  Total revenues from wireline amounted to $23.2 million in the second quarter of 2010, an increase of $1.0 million or 5% over $22.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2009. Wireline revenues from the Company's Guyana operations, which include revenues from local exchange operations, high speed data and international long distance, increased $0.6 million in the second quarter of 2010 over the same quarter in 2009. International long distance revenue in Guyana declined $2.0 million to $7.9 million in 2010 compared to $9.9 million in 2009.  This was offset by an increase of $2.6 million in internet revenues and interconnection fee revenues.
 
Operating Segments
 
Upon completion of the Alltel acquisition the Company modified its segment reporting.  The previously reported Rural Wireless segment has been combined with the operating results of Alltel and is now being reported as the U.S. Wireless segment; the Integrated Telephony  Domestic segment has been renamed U.S. Wireline; the Wireless Data segment has been merged into the Island Wireless segment which generates its revenues in, and has its assets in, Bermuda, Turks and Caicos and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Integrated Telephony  International has been renamed International Integrated Telephony and has its assets located in Guyana.  Additional operating data on our segment operations is as follows:
 
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2010 were $57.6 million. Long term debt was $245.7 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $60.7 million and capital expenditures were $52.0 million The Company expects full year 2010 capital expenditures to be approximately $130 to $140 million, of which $90 to $100 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures.  Specifically, ATN has presented non-GAAP measures of operating income, net income attributable to ATN's stockholders, earnings per diluted share attributable to ATN's stockholders, in each case by excluding charges related to our pending acquisition of certain Alltel assets.  ATN has also presented Adjusted EBITDA measures, defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. Stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, other income, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the pending Alltel transaction.  ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this news release.

Item 1.01
              
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On September 30, 2010, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement between the Company, as Borrower, certain of the Company's subsidiaries, as Guarantors, CoBank, ACB ("CoBank"), as Administrative Agent, Arranger, Swingline Lender, an Issuing Lender and a Lender, and the other Lenders named therein.  The credit agreement provides for a $370.2 million credit facility, consisting of a $72.0 million term loan A (the "Term Loan A"), a $148.1 million term loan B (the "Term Loan B"), a $50.0 million term loan C (the "Term Loan C") and a $100.0 million revolver loan (the "Revolver Loan," and together with the Term Loan A, the Term Loan B and the Term Loan C, the "Credit Facility").
 
Upon the closing of the Credit Facility, $72.0 million under the Term Loan A and $148.1 million under the Term Loan B remained outstanding from the Company's prior credit facility.  Also upon the closing of the Credit Facility, the Company drew down $50.0 million under the Term Loan C, a portion of which was used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Company's prior revolving loan.  The Company currently has no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver Loan, of which the Company may use up to $10.0 million for standby or trade letters of credit and may use up to $10 million under a swingline sub-facility to the Revolver Loan (the "Swingline Facility").
 
The Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Term Loan C each mature on September 30, 2014, unless accelerated pursuant to an event of default, as described below.  The Revolver Loan matures on September 10, 2014, unless accelerated pursuant to an event of default, as described below.  Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan A, Term Loan B, Term Loan C and the Revolver Loan bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin ranging between 3.50% to 4.75% or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.75% (or, in the case of amounts borrowed under the Swingline Facility, an applicable margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.25%).  The base rate is equal to the higher of (i) 1.50% plus the higher of (x) the one-week LIBOR and (y) the one-month LIBOR; and (ii) the prime rate (as defined in the credit agreement).  The applicable margin is determined based on the ratio of the Company's indebtedness (as defined in the credit agreement) to its EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). Under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Company must also pay a fee ranging from 0.50% to 0.75% of the average daily unused portion of the Revolver Loan over each calendar quarter, which fee is payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter.
 
All amounts outstanding under the Revolver Loan will be due and payable upon the earlier of the maturity date or the acceleration of the loan upon an event of default.  Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan A and the Term Loan B became due and payable on September 30, 2010 in quarterly payments equal to 1.25% of the initial principal amount outstanding under each loan, increasing to 2.50% of the initial principal amount outstanding commencing on March 31, 2012.  Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan C will be due and payable commencing on December 31, 2010 in quarterly payments equal to $250,000.  Remaining balances on each of the Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Term Loan C will be due and payable upon maturity, unless the loans are accelerated upon an event of default.
 
Certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility.  Further, the Company's obligations are secured by (i) a first priority, perfected lien on substantially all the property and assets of the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries, including its principal wholly-owned domestic operating subsidiaries and (ii) a pledge of 100% of the Company's equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries and up to 65% of the equity interests outstanding of certain foreign subsidiaries, in each case, including the Company's principal operating subsidiaries.
The Credit Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants by the Company limiting additional indebtedness, liens, guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes.  In addition, the Credit Facility contains financial covenants by the Company (as further defined in the credit agreement) that (i) impose a maximum ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA, (ii) require a minimum ratio of EBITDA to cash interest expense, (iii) require a minimum ratio of equity to consolidated assets and (iv) require a minimum ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges.
 
The Credit Facility provides for events of default customary for credit facilities of this type, including but not limited to non-payment, defaults on other debt, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, representations and warranties, insolvency and bankruptcy.  After the occurrence of an event of default and for so long as it continues, the administrative agent or the requisite lenders (as defined in the credit agreement) may increase the interest rate then in effect on all outstanding obligations by 2.0%.  Upon an event of default relating to insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, the amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility will become immediately due and payable and the lender commitments will be automatically terminated.  Upon the occurrence and continuation of any other event of default, the administrative agent and/or the requisite lenders (as defined in the credit agreement) may accelerate payment of all obligations and terminate the lenders' commitments under the Credit Facility.
 
The foregoing description is only a summary of the provisions of the Credit Facility and is qualified in its entirety by the terms of the credit agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
On September 30, 2010, the Company issued a press release announcing that it had entered into the Credit Facility.  A copy of the press release is furnished herewith as Exhibit 99.1.

If the Letter of Credit is payable in a foreign currency, the amount owed by Borrower in connection with such Letter of Credit shall equal the United States dollar equivalent of such foreign currency (determined by Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) on the date such payment is made by such Issuing Lender.  All amounts paid by an Issuing Lender with respect to any Letter of Credit that are not immediately repaid by Borrower or that are not repaid with a Revolver Loan shall bear interest at the sum of the Base Rate plus 3.750% per annum.  Each Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolver Loan made pursuant to this Subsection 1.1(F)(ii).  In the event Borrower fails to reimburse an Issuing Lender in full on the date of any payment in respect of a Letter of Credit issued for the account of any Loan Party, Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender with a Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Loan Commitment of the amount of such unreimbursed payment and the accrued interest thereon and each such Lender, on the next Business Day, shall deliver to Administrative Agent an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share thereof in same day funds.  Each Lender with a Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Loan Commitment hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender upon demand by such Issuing Lender such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each payment made by such Issuing Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit and not immediately reimbursed by Borrower.  Each Lender with a Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Loan Commitment acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to acquire participations pursuant to this Subsection 1.1(F)(ii) in respect of Letters of Credit and to make the payments to each Issuing Lender required by the preceding sentence are absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or any failure by Borrower to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Subsection 7.2.  If any Lender with a Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Loan Commitment fails to make available to an Issuing Lender the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any payments made by such Issuing Lender in respect of a Letter of Credit as provided in this Subsection 1.1(F)(ii), Administrative Agent may elect to debit the segregated accounts described in Subsection 1.17(A)(iii) and 1.17(B)(iii) by such amount and pay such amount to Issuing Lender.  If  Administrative Agent does not so elect or if the funds in such account are insufficient, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolver Lender together with interest at the Base Rate.

Conditions of Issuance of Letters of Credit

Any notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be accompanied by the form of the Letter of Credit to be provided by an Issuing Lender.  Borrower must also complete any application procedures and documents required by an Issuing Lender in connection with the issuance of any Letter of Credit, including a certificate regarding Borrower's compliance with the provisions of Subsection 7.2 of this Agreement.

Each Revolver Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligations to fund Revolving Loans and/or to acquire participations pursuant to this Subsection 1.1(G)(iv) in respect of Swingline Loans are absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or any failure by Borrower to satisfy any of the conditions set forth in Subsection 7.2.  If any Revolver Lender fails to make available to Swingline Lender the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any payments due as provided in this Subsection 1.1(G)(iv), Administrative Agent may elect to debit the segregated accounts described in Subsection 1.17(A)(iii) and 1.17(B)(iii) by such amount and pay such amount to Swingline Lender.  If Administrative Agent does not so elect or if the funds in such accounts are insufficient, Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest at the Base Rate.  On the Revolver Expiration Date, if not sooner demanded, Borrower shall repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the Swingline Loans.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of Swingline Loans directly to Swingline Lender by such method and to such account or place as Swingline Lender may from time to time designate in writing.

shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders or any Lender for the use or the forbearance of the Indebtedness or Obligations evidenced hereby exceed the maximum permissible under Applicable Law.  If under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the limit of such validity prescribed by Applicable Law then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limit of such validity and if under or from circumstances whatsoever Lenders or any Lender should ever receive as interest any amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, the amount of such interest that is excessive shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Obligations evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest.  Additionally, should the method used for calculating interest on LIBOR Loans (i.e., using a 360-day year) be unlawful, such calculation method shall be automatically changed to a 365-6-day year or such other lawful calculation method as is reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent.

Borrower shall be obligated to pay the amount of such increased cost to Administrative Agent for the benefit of the affected Lenders within 15 days after receipt of such certificate.

Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any Lender to whom payment was due but not made shall be to recover from other Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be entitled (and such other Lenders hereby agree to return to such Lender any such erroneous payments received by them). In performing its functions and duties hereunder, Administrative Agent shall exercise the same care which it would in dealing with loans for its own account, but Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, or for the financial condition of the Loan Parties or any other Person.  Administrative Agent may at any time request instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which by the terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents Administrative Agent is permitted or required to take or to grant, and if such instructions are promptly requested, Administrative Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from any action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents (i) if such action or omission would, in the reasonable opinion of Administrative Agent, violate any Applicable Law or any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or (ii) until it shall have received such instructions from Requisite Lenders or all of Lenders, as applicable.

Guaranty of Secured Obligations by Guarantors
.
 
(A)
         
The Guaranty
.  In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received by Guarantors from the extensions of credit hereunder, each Guarantor hereby agrees with Administrative Agent and the Secured Parties as follows:  each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, to Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties of any and all Secured Obligations.  If any or all of the Secured Obligations become due and payable hereunder, each Guarantor unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, on order, or demand, together with any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties in collecting any of the Secured Obligations.  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that this is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection only.
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Loan Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under Applicable Law (whether federal or state and including, the Bankruptcy Code).  Any analysis of the provisions hereof for purposes of laws relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers shall take into account the contribution agreement established in this Subsection 9.20(A).
 
To the extent that any Guarantor shall be required hereunder to pay any portion of any Secured Obligation exceeding the greater of (i) the amount of the value actually received by such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries from the Loans and other Secured Obligations and (ii) the amount such Guarantor would otherwise have paid if such Guarantor had paid the aggregate amount of
the Secured Obligations (excluding the amount thereof repaid by Borrower) in the same proportion as such Guarantor's net worth on the date enforcement is sought hereunder bears to the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors on such date, then such Guarantor shall be reimbursed by such other Guarantors for the amount of such excess, pro rata, based on the respective net worth of such other Guarantors on such date of enforcement.  The contribution agreement in this paragraph is intended only to define the relative rights of the Guarantors and nothing set forth in this paragraph is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
Each Guarantor's maximum obligations hereunder (the "") in any case or proceeding referred to below (but only in such a case or proceeding) shall not be in excess of:
Maximum Guarantor Liability
 
(i)
           
in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code on or within two (2) years from the date on which any of the Secured Obligations are incurred, the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under (A) Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or (B) any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in such case or proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code; or
 
(ii)
          
in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under the Bankruptcy Code subsequent to two (2) years from the date on which any of the Secured Obligations of such Guarantor are incurred, the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in any such case or proceeding by virtue of Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code;
 
(iii)
         
in a case or proceeding commenced by or against such Guarantor under any law, statute or regulation other than the Bankruptcy Code relating to dissolution, liquidation, conservatorship, bankruptcy, moratorium, readjustment of debt, compromise, rearrangement, receivership, insolvency, reorganization or similar debtor relief from time to time in effect affecting the rights of creditors generally (collectively, ""), the maximum amount that would not otherwise cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) to be avoidable or unenforceable against such Guarantor under such Other Debtor Relief Law, including, any state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance act or statute applied in any such case or proceeding.  (The substantive state or federal laws under which the possible avoidance or unenforceability of the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations
Other Debtor Relief Law
of Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations) shall be determined in any such case or proceeding shall hereinafter be referred to as the "".)
Avoidance Provisions
 
To the extent set forth above, but only to the extent that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20, or the transfers made by such Guarantor under the Security Documents to which it is a party, would otherwise be subject to avoidance under any Avoidance Provisions if such Guarantor is not deemed to have received valuable consideration, fair value, fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for such transfers or obligations, or if such transfers or obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 would render such Guarantor insolvent, or leave such Guarantor with an unreasonably small capital or unreasonably small assets to conduct its business, or cause such Guarantor to have incurred debts (or to have intended to have incurred debts) beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, in each case as of the time any of the obligations of such Guarantor are deemed to have been incurred and transfers made under such Avoidance Provisions, then such obligations shall be reduced to that amount which, after giving effect thereto, would not cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 (or any other obligations of such Guarantor to Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations), as so reduced, to be subject to avoidance under such Avoidance Provisions.  This paragraph is intended solely to preserve the rights hereunder of Administrative Agent, the Lenders and any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations to the maximum extent that would not cause the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 to be subject to avoidance under any Avoidance Provisions, and neither such Guarantor nor any other Person shall have any right, defense, offset, or claim under this paragraph as against Administrative Agent, the Lenders or any other Person holding any of the Secured Obligations that would not otherwise be available to such Person under the Avoidance Provisions.
 
Each Guarantor agrees that the obligations of such Guarantor under this Subsection 9.20 may at any time and from time to time exceed the Maximum Guarantor Liability, without impairing the guaranty or any provision contained herein or affecting the rights and remedies of Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder.
 
(B)
          
Bankruptcy
.  Additionally, each of Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all Secured Obligations whether or not due or payable upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Subsections 6.1(F) or (G) and unconditionally promises to pay such Secured Obligations on demand.  Each of the Guarantors further agrees that to the extent that Borrower or any Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer of an interest in any property to Administrative Agent or any Lender, which payment or transfer or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be repaid to Borrower or any Guarantor, the estate of Borrower or any Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such avoidance or repayment, the obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.
 
(C)
          
Nature of Liability
.  The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the Secured Obligations whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or impaired by (i) any direction as to application of payment by Borrower or by any other party, or (ii) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Secured Obligations, or (iii) any payment on or reduction of any such other guaranty or undertaking, or (iv) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel by Borrower or other guarantor, or (v) any payment made to a Secured Party on the Secured Obligations which such Secured Party repays Borrower or another guarantor pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and each of Guarantors waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any right to the deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.
 
(D)
         
Independent Obligation
.  The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor or Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other guarantor or Borrower and whether or not any other Guarantor or Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.
 
(E)
          
Authorization
.  Each of Guarantors authorizes each Secured Party without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability hereunder, from time to time to (i)  change the terms of the Secured Obligations or any part thereof, with the consent of Borrower, (ii) take and hold security from any other guarantor or any other party for the payment of this guaranty or the Secured Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such security, and apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Administrative Agent and Lenders in their discretion may determine and (iii) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, Borrower or other obligors.
 
(F)
          
Reliance
.  It is not necessary for Administrative Agent or the Lenders to inquire into the capacity or powers of Borrower or any Guarantor or the officers, directors, members, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
 
(G)
          
Waiver
.
 
(i)
           
Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any Secured Party to (1) proceed against Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, (2) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or (3) pursue any other remedy in such Secured Party's power whatsoever.  Each of the Guarantors waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense, other than payment in full of the Secured Obligations, based on or arising out of the disability of Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, or the unenforceability of the indebtedness or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
liability of Borrower other than payment in full of the indebtedness.  Any Secured Party may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by and conducted in accordance with Applicable Law), or exercise any other right or remedy any Secured Party may have against Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the indebtedness has been paid.  Each of the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election by any Secured Party, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantors against Borrower or any other party or any security.
 
(ii)
          
Each of the Guarantors waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, notices of nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness.  Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Secured Parties shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
(iii)
         
Until the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and tax gross-up payment for which no claim has been asserted) have been indefeasibly and irrevocably paid in full in cash, each of the Guarantors hereby waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Borrower, any other Guarantor, any other guarantor of the Secured Obligations (collectively, the ""), or any of its assets in connection with this Guaranty or the performance by such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder or the performance by such Other Party of its obligations under its guaranty, in each case, whether such claim, right or remedy arises under this Guaranty, in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law or otherwise and including (i) any right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Borrower with respect to the Secured Obligations, (ii) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any claim, right or remedy that any Secured Party now has or may hereafter have against Borrower, and (iii) any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Secured Party.  In addition, until the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and tax gross-up payment for which no claim has been asserted) shall have been indefeasibly and irrevocably paid in full in cash and no commitments of Administrative Agent or any Lender which would give rise to any Obligations are outstanding each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of any right of contribution such Guarantor may have against any other Guaranty or any Other Party, including any such right of contribution as contemplated by this Subsection 9.20.  Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement,
Other Parties
indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have against Borrower or against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution such Guarantor may have against any such other Guarantor or Other Party, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights any Secured Party may have against Borrower, to all right, title and interest any Secured Party may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right any Secured Party may have against such other Guarantor or Other Party.  If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time when all Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and tax gross-up payment for which no claim has been asserted) shall not have been indefeasibly and irrevocably paid in full in cash and no commitments of Administrative Agent or any Lender which would give rise to any Obligations are outstanding, such amount shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties to be credited and applied against the Secured Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
(H)
         
Limitation on Enforcement
.  Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties agree that the guaranties provided in this Subsection 9.20 may be enforced only by the action of Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Requisite Lenders and that no Secured Party shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce any such guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties under the terms of this Agreement.
 
(I)
           
Confirmation of Payment
.  Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after payment of the indebtedness and obligations which are the subject of the guaranties provided in this Subsection 9.20 and termination of the Loan Commitments, confirm to Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person that the such Secured Obligations have been paid and the commitments relating thereto terminated, subject to the provisions of Subsection 9.20(B).
 
(J)
           
Subordination of Intercompany Debt
.  Any Indebtedness of Borrower or any Guarantor now or hereafter held by any Guarantor (a "") is hereby subordinated in right of payment to the Secured Obligations, and any such Indebtedness collected or received by a Subordinated Intercompany Lender following the occurrence of any Event of Default shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties to be credited and applied against the Secured Obligations but without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of the Subordinated Intercompany Lender under any other provision hereof.

a License, to the extent that such assignment or change of control would require the prior approval by the FCC under the Communications Act and/or any applicable PUC under the PUC Laws without first obtaining such required approval.

Wireless service revenues were $173.0 million, or 84% of total revenues

Beverly, MA
(October 28, 2010)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010.
 
Third Quarter 2010 Financial Results
 
Total revenues for the third quarter were $205.0 million, of which total wireless service revenues represented $173.0 million, or 84%. This significant increase over last year's third quarter total revenues of $66.1 million resulted from the Company's acquisition of certain former Alltel Wireless retail markets, licenses and network assets, which closed on April 26, 2010. U.S. wireless service revenues totaled $158.8 million, or 77% of total revenues, for the quarter.  The Company ended the quarter with approximately 1.1 million wireless subscribers across all markets.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2010 third quarter was $37.8 million as compared to $35.0 million in the third quarter of 2009, an increase of $2.8 million, or 8%.  The results for the third quarter of 2010 were impacted by significant costs associated with the transition of the recently acquired Alltel Wireless assets.  Specifically, sales and marketing costs in our U.S. Wireless segment included approximately $10.0 million of additional expenses primarily related to an accelerated pace of customer contract renewals and extensions.
 
Total operating income for the third quarter of 2010 was $13.8 million. Operating income in last year's third quarter was $23.1 million, which included $2.1 million in acquisition-related charges.  The decrease in operating income resulted from a $14.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily associated with the acquisition of the Alltel assets, partially offset by the increased operating margin generated by the acquired Alltel properties.
 
Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $6.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, as compared to $11.9 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009.
 
Commenting on third quarter results, Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer said, "The integration of the Alltel asset acquisition is moving ahead as planned, and we continue to make progress in many areas, while refining our value proposition in the new markets.  Revenue and subscriber numbers are broadly in line with our expectations to date, although expenses were at the high end of those expectations for this quarter.  As anticipated, previously-discussed transition initiatives and expenses are causing net attrition as well as higher costs.  We expect margins to remain tight and net subscriber losses, particularly prepaid, to continue over the next few quarters.  Our ability to drive subscriber additions, control churn and optimize our offerings is constrained by our limited billing and point of sale capabilities during this transition period. 
 
(1)
  
See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
By the middle of 2011, however, when we should have much greater ability to tailor our offerings and no longer be burdened by the additional costs and overlaps caused by the transition services agreement that is currently in force, we expect to report more normalized EBITDA margins, net subscriber additions and churn."
 
Other business highlights in the third quarter included:
 
                 
The launch of the Company's new wireless voice and data service in the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of the Island Wireless segment.
                 
The activation of the Company's new undersea cable to Guyana, which will help to provide high-speed data and internet services to that country, resulting in expected growth in data and internet revenue for the International Integrated Telephony segment.
 
Third Quarter 2010 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data services revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations.  Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses amounted to $158.8 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared to $31.8 million in the third quarter of 2009. Total service revenues from the acquired Alltel properties for the quarter were $129.7 million, or the entirety of this increase.
 
Retail wireless service revenues
were $108.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. The Company did not have a U.S. retail wireless business in the third quarter of 2009. At the end of the 2010 third quarter, the Company had approximately 767,000 U.S. retail subscribers, of which approximately 550,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 217,000 were prepaid subscribers.  Additional operating data on our U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4.
 
Wholesale wireless revenues
were $50.0 million, an increase of 57% over the $31.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2009.  Wholesale revenues from the acquired Alltel properties were $20.9 million, or the entirety of this increase.  Data revenues accounted for 27% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 19% a year earlier.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean.  Total revenues from international wireless (which includes revenues from fixed wireless data services) amounted to $14.2 million in the third quarter of 2010, an increase of $2.5 million, or 21%, over $11.7 million reported in the third quarter of 2009.  This increase primarily resulted from growth in the number of wireless subscribers in Guyana and expansion in the Caribbean.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State.  Total revenues from wireline amounted to $20.8 million in the third quarter of 2010, a decrease of $1.2 million or 5% from $22.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2009. The decline resulted from a $1.7 million decrease in international long distance revenues in Guyana, partially offset by increased data revenue in that country and increased revenues generated by U.S. wireline operations.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments:  i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Guyana, iii) U.S. Wireline and iv) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean. 
Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended September 30, 2010 are as follows:
 
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2010 were $61.8 million. Long term debt was $250.8 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $100.3 million and capital expenditures were $91.6 million.  The Company expects full year 2010 capital expenditures to be approximately $130 to $140 million, of which $85 to $95 million is expected to be incurred by the U.S. Wireless segment.
 
In the third quarter, the Company increased the available borrowings under its existing credit facility by $75 million, bringing the total credit facility to $375 million, which will allow the Company to fund planned capital expenditures and growth initiatives.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors that may affect such forward-looking statements.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures.  Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, other income, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the Alltel transaction.  ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods.  The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this news release.

Beverly, MA
(March 1, 2011)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2010.
 
Fourth Quarter 2010 Financial Results
 
"Fourth quarter operating results were similar to those of the third quarter. Revenue growth was driven primarily by our recent acquisition of certain former Alltel wireless assets, net of the anticipated customer attrition. As a result, adjusted EBITDA showed a healthy increase from 2009 levels. This increase did not extend to operating income, which was negatively impacted by the lingering effects of previously discussed transition initiatives and overlapping expenses, as well as the write-up of acquired assets," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer. "Looking forward, while we expect the attrition and expenses to continue through the first half of 2011, we are executing on our strategy of building a sustainable domestic retail wireless business with the capability of generating significantly improved EBITDA margins in the second half of 2011."
 
Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $194.7 million, of which total wireless service revenues represented $164.2 million, or 84%. This significant increase over last year's fourth quarter total revenues of $59.7 million was primarily a result of the Company's acquisition of certain former Alltel Wireless retail markets, licenses and network assets, which closed on April 26, 2010. U.S. wireless service revenues were $150.2 million, or 77% of total revenues, for the quarter.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2010 fourth quarter was $31.3 million, 18% above the $26.5 million in the 2009 fourth quarter. Consistent with this year's third quarter, fourth quarter 2010 results were impacted by significant costs associated with the transition of the recently acquired Alltel Wireless assets. Specifically, we estimate that the U.S. Wireless segment incurred approximately $15.0 million of duplicate expenses related to the transition and additional equipment costs and commissions due to an accelerated pace of customer contract renewals and extensions.
 
(1)    See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
Total operating income for the fourth quarter of 2010 was $9.3 million. This included a $14.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses and a net benefit of $2.1 million in acquisition-related charges due to a final settlement of estimated acquisition costs, both related to the acquisition of the Alltel wireless assets. Operating income in last year's fourth quarter was $11.7 million, which included $4.7 million in acquisition-related charges. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $3.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, as compared to $5.2 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $6.4 million, or $0.41 per share in the 2010 third quarter.
 
"U.S. wireless revenues and subscriber numbers were in line with our expectations and reflected the ongoing initiatives we have implemented to build the stability and value of our domestic retail customer base," Mr. Prior noted. "We will be in a much better position to customize our offerings and leverage our point of sale opportunities, which should result in more normalized margins when we complete our transition. We will continue to address problem areas like involuntary churn, which has remained higher than expected throughout this transition period, but until we complete the transition, we expect margins to continue to be thin and net subscriber losses, particularly in prepaid, to continue. We currently expect to complete the transition late in the second quarter of 2011."
 
Fourth Quarter 2010 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses amounted to $150.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $25.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total service revenues from the acquired Alltel properties for the quarter were $124.4 million, or the majority of this increase.
 
U.S. Retail wireless service revenues
were $102.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2010. The Company did not have a U.S. retail wireless business in the fourth quarter of 2009. At the end of the 2010 fourth quarter, the Company had approximately 718,000 U.S. retail subscribers, of which approximately 523,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 195,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on our U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4.
 
U.S. Wholesale wireless revenues
were $47.4 million, an increase of 87% over the $25.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. Wholesale revenues from the acquired Alltel properties were $21.7 million, representing most of the increase. Data revenues accounted for 33% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 22% a year earlier. In 2011, as previously disclosed, we expect a decline in wholesale revenues from some of our legacy areas due to the acquisition of certain overlapping networks by AT&T. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we estimate that revenues at risk from this overlap were approximately $14.0 million.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including Guyana. Total revenues from international wireless (which includes revenues from fixed wireless data services) amounted to $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, an increase of $2.4 million, or 21%, over the $11.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. This increase primarily resulted from growth in the number of wireless subscribers in Guyana and expansion elsewhere in the Caribbean.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Total revenues from wireline amounted to $19.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of $1.9 million or 9% from $21.8 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline resulted from a $2.4 million decrease in international long distance revenues in Guyana, partially offset by increased data revenues in that country and increased revenues generated by U.S. wireline operations.
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Guyana, iii) U.S. Wireline and iv) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean.  Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended December 31, 2010 are as follows:
 
 
*  Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
Full Year 2010 Results
 
                 
Total revenue increased to $619.1 million from $242.3 million in 2009
                 
Total wireless revenue increased to $504.6 million from $150.0 million in 2009
                 
Adjusted EBITDA was $128.8 million, up 11% from $115.7 million in 2009.
                 
Net income was $38.5 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, as compared to $35.5 million, or $2.32 per diluted share in 2009.
 
Commenting on full year 2010 results, Mr. Prior said, "This was another year of solid performance for ATN. We succeeded in maintaining positive momentum in our international businesses, while completing a transformational acquisition that has significantly increased our domestic wireless footprint and our earnings and cash flow potential."
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2010 were $37.3 million. Long-term debt was $272.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $102.3 million and capital expenditures were $135.7 million. The Company expects full year 2011 capital expenditures to approximate $105 to $120 million, of which $70 to $80 million is expected to be incurred by the U.S. Wireless segment.

These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results.  Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1) our ability to operate a large sc ale retail wireless business in the United States and integrate these operations into our existing operations; (2)  the general performance of our U.S. operations, including operating margins, and the future retention and turnover of the our subscriber base; (3) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements; (4) increased competition; (5) economic, political and other risks facing our foreign operations; (6) the loss of certain FCC and other licenses and other regulatory changes affecting our businesses; (7) rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (8) any loss of any key members of management; (9) our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure and retail wireless business; (10) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of our network capacity and customer service system to support our customer growth; (11) the occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes; (12) the current difficult global economic environment, along with difficult and volatile conditions in the capital and credit markets; and (13) our ability to realize the value that we believe exists in businesses that we may or have acquired.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, other income, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gai n a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the Alltel transaction. ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this news release.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
Financial Highlights:
 
     
Total revenues were $188.2 million
     
Wireless service revenues were $159.3 million, or 85% of total revenues
     
Adjusted EBITDA was $35.4 million

Beverly, MA
(May 3, 2011)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
 
First Quarter 2011 Financial Results
 
"As expected, first quarter operating results continued to be impacted by transition initiatives and overlapping expenses related to our acquisition of certain former Alltel wireless assets. However, we were pleased that certain metrics, including Adjusted EBITDA and operating income, showed sequential improvement over fourth quarter 2010 levels. This reflected reductions in several expense categories related to our U.S. wireless business and resulted in the expansion of our Adjusted EBITDA margin for this segment from 16% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 18% this quarter," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer. "Looking ahead, we believe that second quarter 2011 results are likely to be our most challenging of the year, as we absorb the full expense of the final stage of our transition efforts, continue to experience customer attrition, and we work through any short-term difficulties that may arise during the systems conversion which is scheduled to be completed in the middle of this year. By contrast, second half 2011 operating results are expected to show marked improvement, demonstrating our ability to generate significantly improved EBITDA margins once the transition is completed."
 
Total revenues for the first quarter were $188.2 million, compared to $54.8 million for the first quarter of 2010, an increase of 243%. Total wireless service revenues represented $159.3 million, or 85% of total revenue. This significant increase over last year's first quarter total revenues was primarily a result of the Company's acquisition of certain former Alltel wireless assets, which was completed on April 26, 2010. U.S. Wireless service revenues were $144.4 million, or 77% of total revenues, for the quarter.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2011 first quarter was $35.4 million compared to $22.3 million in the 2010 first quarter and $31.3 million in the 2010 fourth quarter. Consistent with the past several quarters, first quarter
 
(1)    See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
2011 U.S. Wireless segment results were impacted by significant costs associated with the transition of the recently acquired Alltel wireless assets. We estimate that duplicate transition-related expenses and the net impact of other one-time items were approximately $9.3 million this quarter.
 
Total operating income for the first quarter of 2011 was $10.4 million compared to $7.4 million in last year's first quarter and $9.3 million in the 2010 fourth quarter. First quarter 2011 operating income included a $14.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses over the prior year's first quarter and $0.3 million in acquisition-related charges. Last year's first quarter operating income included $4.8 million in acquisition-related charges. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $4.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, as compared to $4.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010 and $3.3 million, or $0.21 per share in the 2010 fourth quarter.
 
"Building the stability and value of our domestic retail customer base remains a high priority, and we have implemented several initiatives that expand the array of available devices, improve network quality for voice and high speed data and provide our customers with affordable and flexible wireless plans, " Mr. Prior noted. "Our ability to customize offerings and fully utilize our point of sale opportunities with customers, however, has been limited during the transition period. In the second half of 2011, with the transition behind us, we expect to take advantage of the significant marketing expertise we have within our organization as well as the existing Alltel brand equity to work on reducing churn and improving sales metrics throughout our domestic wireless markets.
 
"International operations and U.S. Wireline operations showed steady progress in this year's first quarter," Mr. Prior said. "International revenues benefited from an 8% increase in the number of wireless subscribers over last year's first quarter; and US Wireline saw a modest uptick overall from growth in our wholesale capacity business in the New York State."
 
First Quarter 2011 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses amounted to $144.4 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared to $22.9 million in the first quarter of 2010. Total service revenues from the acquired Alltel properties for the quarter were $121.9 million.
 
U.S. Retail wireless service revenues
were $99.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The Company did not have a U.S. retail wireless business in the first quarter of 2010. At the end of the 2011 first quarter, the Company had approximately 674,000 U.S. retail subscribers, of which approximately 504,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 170,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on our U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. Wholesale wireless revenues
were $44.7 million, an increase of 95% over the $22.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2010. Wholesale revenues from the acquired Alltel properties were $22.3 million. Data revenues accounted for 40% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 22% a year earlier.  As expected, wholesale revenues in legacy "roam only" markets were marginally impacted by revenue lost as a result of AT&T's acquisition and network conversion of certain former Alltel markets.  The Company expects this lost revenue amount to increase and to continue to negatively impact wholesale wireless revenues in coming quarters, likely more than offsetting any organic year-on-year growth in this revenue stream.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including Guyana. Total revenues from international wireless (which includes revenues from fixed wireless data services) amounted to $14.9 million in the first quarter of 2011, an increase of $4.0 million, or 37%, over the $10.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2010. This increase primarily resulted from growth in the number of wireless
 
 
subscribers in Guyana and expansion elsewhere in the Caribbean.  International wireless revenue is expected to show an even larger increase over the next four quarters, mainly as a result of the business combination in Bermuda that the Company announced this morning in a separate release.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls in and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Total revenues from wireline amounted to $20.7 million in the first quarter of 2011, a slight increase of $0.2 million from $20.5 million reported in the first quarter of 2010.  A decline in long distance revenue in Guyana was offset by data revenue growth in Guyana and wholesale capacity revenue growth in New York State.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana, iii) U.S. Wireline and iv) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended March 31, 2011 are as follows:
 
 
(1)  Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2011 were $47.0 million. Long-term debt was $277.5 million. For the quarter ended March 31, 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $21.0 million and capital expenditures were $16.3 million. The Company still expects full year 2011 capital expenditures to approximate $105 to $120 million, of which $70 to $80 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.

Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, other income, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.

Beverly, MA
(August 2, 2011)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011 and announced the completion of the migration of its U.S. Wireless customer base to its own information technology systems and platforms.
 
"This was a period of significant accomplishment for ATN, as we completed the transition of our Alltel customers to our own operating platform, billing system and customer care centers in late July," said Michael Prior, Chief Executive Officer.  "The completion of this conversion allows us to eliminate the overlapping expenses incurred under our Transition Services Agreement ("TSA") with Verizon that have negatively affected our results over the past several quarters.  As anticipated, second quarter operating results included the largest expenses of our transition program, but resulted in only a modest sequential decline in margins for the period due to growth and cost efficiencies in other areas.   We were also pleased to see continued improvement in many of our retail wireless operating metrics, including ARPU and churn, particularly on the postpaid side.
 
"While the residual impact of TSA payments and overlapping transition expenses incurred in July will affect our third quarter of 2011 costs, with the transition now complete we expect U.S. Wireless segment margins to progressively improve in the second half of this year.
 
Second Quarter 2011 Financial Results
 
Total revenues for the second quarter were $193.8 million, compared to $164.7 million for the second quarter of 2010. The 18% increase over last year's second quarter total revenues resulted primarily from the inclusion of a full quarter's operations of the former Alltel wireless assets that the Company acquired on April 26, 2010. Total wireless service revenues represented $166.0 million, or 86% of total revenue.  U.S. Wireless service revenues were $147.3 million, or 76% of total revenues, for the quarter.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2011 second quarter was $32.0 million compared to $37.4 million in the 2010 second quarter and $35.4 million in the 2011 first quarter. Consistent with the past several quarters, second quarter 2011 U.S. Wireless segment results were impacted by significant costs associated with the transition of the acquired Alltel wireless assets. The Company estimates that duplicate transition-related expenses and the net impact of other one-time items were approximately $14.8 million in the second quarter as compared to $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2011.  The Company estimates that these Alltel transition costs will be in the range of $5 million to $6 million during the third quarter of 2011, representing the last period in which the Company will incur these costs.
 
Total operating income was $6.3 million compared to $7.8 million in last year's second quarter and $10.4 million in the 2011 first quarter. Second quarter 2011 operating income included a $6.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses over the prior year's second quarter and $0.3 million in acquisition-related charges. Last year's second quarter operating income included $11.0 million in acquisition-related charges due to the completion of the acquisition of Alltel wireless assets. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $1.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, as compared to $24.8 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2010 and $4.5 million, or $0.29 per share in the 2011 first quarter.  Second quarter 2010 net income included a bargain purchase gain, net of taxes, of $27.0 million related to the Company's acquisition of former Alltel Wireless assets.
 
"Our ability to build a sustainable domestic retail customer base has been significantly enhanced by the migration of our customers to our new customer care and information technology platform," Mr. Prior noted.  "While our focus continues to be on providing superior customer experience, network quality and coverage, we look forward to taking full advantage of the strong marketing expertise we have within our organization to launch new offerings and promotions customized for our subscribers' needs.  Looking forward, we expect subscriber metrics and retail operating margins to progressively improve in the next few quarters as we work toward optimizing our service offerings and our cost structure.
 
"The merger of our Bermuda wireless business, CellOne, with M3 Wireless, a leading wireless provider in Bermuda, was also completed during the second quarter and is expected to be accretive before the end of 2011.  A re-branding and new marketing campaign has been well received by customers, and we expect to see continuing growth in Island Wireless revenues as a result of the transaction," Mr. Prior noted.
 
Second Quarter 2011 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses amounted to $147.3 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared to $121.1 million in the second quarter of 2010.
 
U.S. retail wireless service revenues
were $95.4 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, a decrease of 4% from the $99.7 million reported in the quarter ended March 31, 2011.   Service revenue declines in the second quarter were a result of a decline in the number of subscribers as the Company continued to experience net subscriber attrition through the transition period. At the end of the second quarter of 2011, the Company had approximately 639,000 U.S. retail subscribers, of which approximately 493,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 146,000 were prepaid subscribers.  The Company acquired its U.S. retail wireless business on April 26, 2010, and revenue for this business for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 was $81.5 million. Additional operating data on our U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. wholesale wireless revenues
were $51.9 million, an increase of 31% over the $39.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2010.  Data revenues accounted for 42% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 24% a year earlier.  Data volume growth and seasonality, as well as a slightly larger network coverage area, helped offset the impact of rate reductions for voice and data roaming such that wholesale revenue increased 16% over the first quarter of 2011.  As expected, wholesale revenues in legacy "roam only" markets were impacted by
 
(1)
         
See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
revenue lost as a result of AT&T's acquisition and network conversion of certain former Alltel markets.  The Company expects this network conversion to continue to negatively impact wholesale wireless revenues in coming quarters, although to an increasingly lesser degree than experienced in the second quarter of 2011.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including the U.S. Virgin Islands. Total revenues from international wireless amounted to $18.7 million in the second quarter of 2011, an increase of $6.1 million, or 48%, over the $12.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2010. This increase resulted from the Company's merger with M3 Wireless, Ltd. on May 2, 2011, the acquisition of wireless operations in Aruba which occurred at the end of the second quarter of 2010, and growth in the number of wireless subscribers in Guyana and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls in and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Total revenues from wireline amounted to $20.9 million in the second quarter of 2011, a decrease of $2.3 million from $23.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2010.  The decrease resulted from a decline in long distance revenue in Guyana, which was partially offset by data revenue growth in Guyana and growth in capacity sales in New York State.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana, iii) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean and iv) U.S. Wireline. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended June 30, 2011 are as follows:
 
 
(1)
         
Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2011 were $46.8 million. Long-term debt was $289.7 million. For the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.0 million and was $43.0 million for the first half of 2011.  Second quarter capital expenditures were $29.2 million, and $45.4 million for the first half of 2011. Consistent with previous indications, the Company expects full year 2011 capital expenditures to approximate $105 to $120 million, of which $70 to $80 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.

These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results.  Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1)  the general performance of our operations, including operating margins, and the future retention and turnover of our subscriber base; (2) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements; (3) increased competition; (4) economic, political and other risks facing our foreign operations; (5) the loss of certain FCC and other licenses and other regulatory changes affecting our businesses; (6) rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (7) any loss of any key members of management; (8) our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure and retail wireless business; (9) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of our network capacity and customer service system to support our customer growth; (10) the occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes; (11) our continued access to capital and credit markets; and (12) our ability to realize the value that we believe exists in businesses that we may or have acquired.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, other income, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the Alltel transaction. ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this press release.

On September 2, 2011, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") announced that Mr. Thomas Cunningham resigned from its Board of Directors to pursue a business relationship with a small, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On that date, the Company sent a letter to The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") notifying it that, as a result, the Company does not comply with NASDAQ Rule 5605(b)(1), which requires that a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors be "independent directors," as defined in the NASDAQ rules. Mr. Cunningham did not sit on either of the Company's Audit or Compensation Committees, which remain composed entirely of independent directors.
 
As anticipated, on September 8, 2011, the Company received a notice from NASDAQ that, as described above, the Company is not in compliance with Rule 5605(b).  Under Rule 5605(b)(1)(A), the Company has until the earlier of the Company's 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or September 4, 2012  to regain compliance.  The Company is currently seeking a suitable candidate to be elected or appointed to its Board of Directors, and expects to regain compliance with Rule 5605(b)(1) before the expiration of such cure period.  The NASDAQ notice has no effect on the listing of the Company's common stock at this time.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Beverly, MA
(November 2, 2011)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011.
 
Third Quarter 2011 Financial Results
 
"This was a strong quarter for us in many key areas," noted Michael Prior, Chief Executive Officer.  "The significant year-over-year and sequential improvements in profitability were mainly driven by cost reductions with the completion of the transition of Alltel customers to our own operating platform, billing system and customer care centers in late July.  Adjusted EBITDA margin for the U.S. Wireless segment reached 28% for the period, representing a substantial increase over the prior year and recent quarters, as overlapping expenses were markedly reduced.  Our third quarter U.S. wireless subscriber metrics, however, lagged expectations.   While we believe that gross subscriber additions, in particular, were affected by certain constraints we put in place just prior to and subsequent to the final transition, and had expected to see some pick up in churn in the immediate aftermath of conversion, it is clear that we have more to do to see improved subscriber metrics.
 
"Third quarter profitability also benefited from seasonally high roaming revenues and improved results from our international businesses.  These results demonstrate the earnings potential that ATN has gained through the Alltel asset acquisition and the continued solid contributions from our other businesses."
 
Total revenues for the third quarter were $194.3 million, a 5% decline from the $205.0 million reported for the third quarter of 2010.
 
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2011 third quarter was $52.0 million, an increase of 38% over the $37.8 million reported in last year's third quarter. The Company estimates that duplicate transition-related expenses were approximately $4.9 million in the third quarter of 2011, offset in part by other one-time benefits of approximately $3.6 million mainly related to out of period ETC revenues and USF expense adjustments.  Wireless retail revenues were also negatively impacted this quarter by approximately $2.3 million related to the decision to forego the billing of certain items for a period following the system conversion.  Duplicate transition-related expenses and the net impact of other one-time items were approximately $10.0 million in the 2010 third quarter.
 
Total operating income was $27.6 million, twice the $13.8 million reported in last year's third quarter. Third quarter 2011 operating income included a $2.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses over the prior year's third quarter. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $11.3 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, up from the $6.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, earned in the third quarter of 2010.
 
"With the Alltel customer transition successfully behind us, our focus is now on increasing the competitiveness of our domestic retail wireless offers and plans by specifically tailoring them to our markets, which we expect will result in improved subscriber metrics over the next several quarters.
 
"A noteworthy contributor to our strong 2011 third quarter results was our Bermuda wireless operation, CellOne, whose performance has benefited from the merger we concluded in this year's second quarter and our ability to quickly achieve significant synergies from that transaction," Mr. Prior noted.
 
Third Quarter 2011 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses amounted to $146.2 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared to $158.8 million in the third quarter of 2010.
 
U.S. retail wireless service revenues
were $89.1 million for the third quarter of 2011, a decrease of 18% from the $108.8 million reported in the 2010 third quarter.   Service revenue declines were the result of the net subscriber attrition that the Company has experienced through the transition period. At the end of the third quarter of 2011, the Company had approximately 593,000 U.S. retail subscribers, of which approximately 470,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 123,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on our U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. wholesale wireless revenues
were $57.1 million, an increase of 14% over the $50.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2010.  Data revenues accounted for 46% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 27% a year earlier.  Data volume growth, as well as a slightly larger network coverage area, largely offset the impact of expected revenue losses in certain areas of the Company's legacy "roam only" markets and previously-reported rate reductions for voice and data.
 
(1)    See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including the U.S. Virgin Islands. Total revenues from international wireless were $20.5 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $6.6 million, or 47%, over the $13.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2010. This increase was primarily due to the Company's merger of its Bermuda operations with M3 Wireless, Ltd. on May 2, 2011 and growth in the number of wireless subscribers in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Total revenues from wireline amounted to $21.7 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of $0.9 million from $20.8 million reported in the third quarter of 2010.  The increase resulted primarily from data revenue and local wireline service growth in Guyana, as well as growth in fiber optic capacity sales in New York State.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana, iii) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean and iv) U.S. Wireline. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended September 30, 2011 are as follows:
 
 
(1)
         
Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2011 were $52.1 million. Long-term debt was $274.1 million. For the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $41.7 million and was $84.7 million for the first nine months of 2011.  Third quarter capital expenditures were $20.4 million, and $65.9 million for the first nine months of 2011. The Company expects full year 2011 capital expenditures to approximate $95 to $105 million, of which $65 to $70 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.

These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results.  Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1)  the general performance of our operations, including operating margins, and the future retention and turnover of our subscriber base; (2) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements; (3) increased competition; (4) economic, political and other risks facing our foreign operations; (5) the loss of certain FCC and other licenses, USF funds or other regulatory changes affecting our businesses; (6) rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (7) any loss of any key members of management; (8) our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure and retail wireless business; (9) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of our network capacity and customer service system to support our customer growth; (10) the occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes; (11) our continued access to capital and credit markets; and (12) our ability to realize the value that we believe exists in our businesses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, gain on disposition of long-lived assets, other income, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the Alltel transaction. ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this press release.

Beverly, MA
(March 1, 2012)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2011.
 
"This was our first full quarter without the burden of overlapping transition expenses associated with the Alltel asset acquisition, and we are pleased to have posted a significant year-over-year increase in Adjusted EBITDA," said Michael Prior, Chief Executive Officer. "Additionally, we saw improvement in certain of our subscriber metrics, including increased gross additions and ARPU, and reduced churn.   We are encouraged by the positive customer response to the new value plans we launched during the fourth quarter, but there is still room for improvement in this business.  Among the priorities for 2012, we need to increase gross customer additions and maintain or improve churn, while at the same time reducing retail operating expenses.
 
"Fourth quarter results also benefited from an 88% year-over-year increase in our Island Wireless segment revenues, primarily reflecting the increased strength of our Bermuda operations following the merger we completed there in the second quarter of 2011," Mr. Prior said.
 
Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $182.9 million, a 6% decline from the $194.7 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2010, reflecting net subscriber attrition that the Company experienced since the Alltel acquisition as the Company transitioned distribution channels, subscriber contracts and credit policies, systems and networks.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2011 fourth quarter was $40.7 million, an increase of 30% over the $31.3 million reported in last year's fourth quarter, and reflected improved performance in all four of ATN's reportable segments.
 
Total operating income was $10.9 million, an increase of 18% from the $9.3 million reported in last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter 2011 operating income was negatively impacted by a $3.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses over the prior year's fourth quarter, as well as a $2.4 million intangible asset impairment charge related to the Company's Island Wireless segment. Fourth quarter 2010 operating income also included a net benefit of $2.1 million in acquisition-related charges due to a final settlement of estimated Alltel acquisition costs.
 
Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $4.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, inclusive of $2.4 million or $0.16 per diluted share in a non-cash impairment charge noted above.  Fourth quarter 2011 net income attributable to ATN's stockholders increased 26% from the $3.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, earned in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Excluding the effect of the non-cash impairment charge, net income attributable to ATN's stockholders would have doubled as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
Commenting on full year 2011 results, Mr. Prior said, "This was a year of significant achievement for ATN.  We completed the transition of the customer base and retail operations we acquired in the Alltel asset transaction to our own networks and operating platforms, and we considerably expanded our international wireless business.  Despite the negative impact of certain transition initiatives and related overlapping expenses, we were able to report year-over-year increases in Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow of 24% and 31%, respectively.  In 2012, we will focus both on improving operating efficiencies across our organization and pursuing additional opportunities to build value."
 
Fourth Quarter 2011 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses amounted to $134.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $150.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
U.S. retail wireless service revenues
were $86.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of 16% from the $102.8 million reported in the 2010 fourth quarter.   Retail service revenue declined as a result of the net subscriber attrition that the Company experienced during the year. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company had approximately 582,000 U.S. retail subscribers, of which approximately 458,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 124,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on our U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. wholesale wireless revenues
were $48.4 million, an increase of 2% over the $47.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Data revenues accounted for 46% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 34% a year earlier.  Data volume growth has largely offset the impact of the previously-reported revenue losses in certain areas of the Company's legacy "roam only" markets and rate reductions for voice and data.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including the U.S. Virgin Islands. Total revenues
 
(1)    See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
from international wireless were $19.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $6.0 million, or 44%, over the $13.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase was primarily due to the Company's merger of its Bermuda operations with one of its competitors on May 2, 2011 and growth in the number of wireless subscribers in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Total revenues from wireline amounted to $21.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 9% from $19.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The increase resulted primarily from data revenue and local wireline service growth in Guyana, as well as growth in fiber optic capacity revenues in New York State.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana, iii) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean (including the U.S. Virgin Islands) and iv) U.S. Wireline. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended December 31, 2011 are as follows:

Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 were $48.7 million. Long-term debt was $257.1 million. For the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $47.9 million and was $132.6 million for the full year 2011.  Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $35.5 million, and $101.4 million for the full year 2011. The Company expects full year 2012 capital expenditures to approximate $90 to $110 million, of which $50 to $65 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.

Fourth Quarter 2011 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses amounted to $134.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $150.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
 
U.S. retail wireless service revenues
were $86.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of 16% from the $102.8 million reported in the 2010 fourth quarter.   Retail service revenue declined as a result of the net subscriber attrition that the Company experienced during the year. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company had approximately 582,000 U.S. retail subscribers, of which approximately 458,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 124,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on our U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. wholesale wireless revenues
were $48.4 million, an increase of 2% over the $47.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Data revenues accounted for 46% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 34% a year earlier.  Data volume growth has largely offset the impact of the previously-reported revenue losses in certain areas of the Company's legacy "roam only" markets and rate reductions for voice and data.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including the U.S. Virgin Islands. Total revenues
 
(1)    See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
 
from international wireless were $19.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of $6.0 million, or 44%, over the $13.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. This increase was primarily due to the Company's merger of its Bermuda operations with one of its competitors on May 2, 2011 and growth in the number of wireless subscribers in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Total revenues from wireline amounted to $21.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 9% from $19.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The increase resulted primarily from data revenue and local wireline service growth in Guyana, as well as growth in fiber optic capacity revenues in New York State.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana, iii) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean (including the U.S. Virgin Islands) and iv) U.S. Wireline. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended December 31, 2011 are as follows (reported in thousands):

Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2011 were $48.7 million. Long-term debt was $257.1 million. For the fourth quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $47.9 million and was $132.6 million for the full year 2011.  Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $35.5 million, and $101.4 million for the full year 2011. The Company expects full year 2012 capital expenditures to approximate $90 to $110 million, of which $50 to $65 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other matters, our future financial performance and results of operations; the competitive environment in our key markets, demand for our services and industry trends; the outcome of regulatory matters; our continued access to the credit and capital markets; the pace of our network expansion and improvement, including our level of estimated future capital expenditures and our realization of the benefits of these investments; and management's plans and strategy for the future. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results.  Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1)  the general performance of our operations, including operating margins, and the future retention and turnover of our subscriber base; (2) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements; (3) increased competition; (4) economic, political and other risks facing our foreign operations; (5) the loss of certain FCC and other licenses, USF funds or other regulatory changes affecting our businesses; (6) rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (7) any loss of any key members of management; (8) our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure and retail wireless business; (9) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of our network capacity and customer service system to support our customer growth; (10) the occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes; (11) our continued access to capital and credit markets; and (12) our ability to realize the value that we believe exists in our businesses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, impairment of intangible assets, gain on disposition of long-lived assets, other income, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the Alltel transaction. ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this press release.

Beverly, MA
(May 2, 2012)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
 
First Quarter 2012 Financial Results
 
"Our strong first quarter year-on-year performance was a result of a combination of revenue growth across several of our operations, including U.S. wholesale wireless, international wireless and wireline, and expense reductions and operating efficiencies following the Alltel transition, which was completed in the third quarter of last year," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer. "The revenue decline in our U.S. retail wireless business this quarter was due to the net subscriber attrition that we experienced in 2011. The success of our new prepaid plans rolled out towards the end of last year generated stronger gross subscriber additions and kept overall subscriber levels fairly stable for the first time since the acquisition.  We would like to turn that into modest growth in subscribers in coming quarters and, to accomplish that, we will have to gain more traction with post-paid subscribers in particular. We are offering a very compelling value proposition in our markets, and we are working on several initiatives to expand distribution and drive customer traffic.
 
"We are very enthusiastic about our upcoming launch in Wal-Mart as a retail wireless sales channel in our markets, and we expect to begin offering service through that channel this month," Mr. Prior added.  "Through a partnership we developed with U.S. Cellular to offer our branded U Prepaid no contract wireless service in Wal-Mart, we are able to reinforce our position as the "local" wireless carrier offering a hometown alternative in the communities we serve."
 
Total revenues for the first quarter were $182.9 million, a 3% decrease from the $188.2 million reported for the first quarter of 2011, reflecting lower U.S. retail wireless revenues, partially offset by higher U.S. wholesale and international revenues.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2012 first quarter was $45.2 million, 28% above the $35.4 million reported in the 2011 first quarter, led by the strong performance of our U.S. Wireless and Island Wireless segments. Total operating income for the first quarter of 2012 was $18.2 million, a 75% increase over the $10.4 million reported in last year's first quarter. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $9.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, more than double the $4.5 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, reported in last year's first quarter.
 
"We were pleased with the growth in operating profitability this quarter," Mr. Prior noted.  "Among the positive factors contributing to this was an increase in wholesale revenue and a decrease in roaming expense, as well as a number of other improvements in operating expenses that were inflated during and following the Alltel transition period."
 
First Quarter 2012 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses were $134.1 million compared to $144.4 million in the first quarter of 2011.
 
U.S. Retail wireless service revenues
were $86.8 million, 13% below the $99.7 million reported in the 2011 first quarter.  This decrease was due to the net subscriber attrition that we experienced over the past year. At the end of the 2012 first quarter, the Company had approximately 579,000 U.S. retail subscribers, a decrease of 14% from the approximately 674,000 subscribers the Company had at the end of last year's first quarter.  Of the March 31, 2012 subscriber base, approximately 448,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 131,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on our U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. Wholesale wireless revenues
were $47.4 million, an increase of 6% over the $44.7 million reported in the first quarter of 2011. Data revenues accounted for 48% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 40% a year earlier. Data volume growth continued to offset the impact of previously-reported revenue losses in certain areas of the Company's "roam only" markets and rate reductions for voice and data traffic.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including the U.S. Virgin Islands. Total revenues from international wireless were $19.0 million, an increase of 35% over the $14.1 million reported in the first quarter of 2011. This increase primarily resulted from the Company's merger of its Bermuda operations with one of its competitors in May 2011, and subscriber growth in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Total revenues from wireline were $21.5 million, an increase of 4% from the $20.7 million reported in the first quarter of 2011. The increase resulted primarily from data revenue and other wireline revenue growth in Guyana.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2012 were $53.7 million. Long-term debt was $264.1 million. For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $21.0 million and capital expenditures were $19.1 million. The Company confirms its expectation that full year 2012 capital expenditures will approximate $90 to $110 million, of which $50 to $65 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.

Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
On May 18, 2012, Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") among the Company, as Borrower, certain of the Company's subsidiaries, as Guarantors, CoBank, ACB ("CoBank"), as Administrative Agent, Lead Arranger, Swingline Lender, an Issuing Lender and a Lender, and the other Lenders named therein.  The Credit Agreement provides for a $375 million credit facility, consisting of a $125 million term loan A-1 (the "Term Loan A-1"), a $150 million term loan A-2 (the "Term Loan A-2"), and a $100 million revolver loan (the "Revolver Loan," and together with the Term Loan A-1 and the Term Loan A-2, the "Credit Facility"). The Company may use up to $10 million under the Revolver Loan for standby or trade letters of credit and may use up to $10 million under a swingline sub-facility to the Revolver Loan (the "Swingline Facility").
 
Upon the closing of the Credit Facility, $125 million under the Term Loan A-1, $150 million under the Term Loan A-2, $10 million under the Revolver Loan and $0.6 million under the Swingline Facility were outstanding.
 
The Term Loan A-1 and the Revolver Loan each mature on June 30, 2017 and the Term Loan A-2 matures on June 30, 2019, in each case unless accelerated pursuant to an event of default, as described below.  Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan A-1and the Revolver Loan bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.00% to 3.50% or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.50% (or, in the case of amounts borrowed under the Swingline Facility, an applicable margin ranging from 0.50% to 2.00%).  Amounts borrowed under the Term Loan A-2 bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company's option, either (i) the LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.50% to 4.00% or (ii) a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.50% to 3.00%.  The base rate is equal to the higher of (i) 1.50% plus the higher of (x) the one-week LIBOR and (y) the one-month LIBOR; and (ii) the prime rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement).  The applicable margin is determined based on the ratio of the Company's indebtedness (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to its EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company must also pay a fee ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% of the average daily unused portion of the Revolver Loan over each calendar quarter, which fee is payable in arrears on the last day of each calendar quarter.
 
All amounts outstanding under the Revolver Loan will be due and payable upon the earlier of the maturity date or the acceleration of the loan upon an event of default.  Amounts outstanding under the Term Loan A-1 and the Term Loan A-2 will become due and payable on September 30, 2012 in quarterly payments equal to (i) 2.5% of the initial principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan A-1 and (ii) 0.25% of the initial principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan A-2.  Remaining balances on each of the Term Loan A-1 and Term Loan A-2 will be due and payable upon maturity, unless the loans are accelerated upon an event of default.
 
Certain of the Company's domestic subsidiaries are guarantors of the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement.  Further, the Company's obligations are secured by (i) a first priority, perfected lien on substantially all the property and assets of the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries, including its principal wholly-owned domestic operating subsidiaries and (ii) a pledge of 100% of the Company's equity interests in certain domestic subsidiaries and up to 65% of the equity interests outstanding of certain foreign subsidiaries, in each case, including the Company's principal operating subsidiaries.
 
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants by the Company limiting additional indebtedness, liens, guaranties, mergers and consolidations, substantial asset sales, investments and loans, sale and leasebacks, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes.  In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants by the Company (as further defined in the Credit Agreement) that (i) impose a maximum ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA, (ii) require a minimum ratio of EBITDA to principal, interest and cash tax expenses and (iii) require a minimum ratio of equity to consolidated assets.
 
The Credit Agreement provides for events of default customary for credit facilities of this type, including but not limited to non-payment, defaults on other debt, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, representations and warranties, insolvency and bankruptcy.  After the occurrence of a payment- or insolvency-related event of default and for so long as it continues, the interest rate then in effect on all outstanding obligations automatically increases by 2.0%. After the occurrence of a bankruptcy or receivership-related event of default and for so long as it continues, the requisite lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) may increase the interest rate then in effect on all outstanding obligations by 2.0%. After the occurrence of any other event of default and for so long as it continues, the administrative agent or the requisite lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) may increase the interest rate then in effect on all outstanding obligations by 2.0%.  Upon an event of default relating to insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, the amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement will become immediately due and payable and the
 
lender commitments will be automatically terminated.

If any Revolver Lender fails to make available to Swingline Lender the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any payments due as provided in this Subsection 1.1(G)(iv), Administrative Agent may elect to apply Cash Collateral as described in Subsection 1.14(C) by such amount and pay such amount to Swingline Lender.  If Administrative Agent does not so elect or if the funds in such accounts are insufficient, Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest at the Base Rate.  On the Revolver Expiration Date, if not sooner demanded, Borrower shall repay in full the outstanding principal amount of the Swingline Loans.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Borrower shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of Swingline Loans directly to Swingline Lender by such method and to such account or place as Swingline Lender may from time to time designate in writing.

LIBOR Interest Period
 
(i)            the LIBOR Interest Period will commence on the date that the LIBOR Loan is made or the date on which any portion of any Base Rate Loan is converted into a LIBOR Loan, or, in the case of immediately successive LIBOR Interest Periods, each successive LIBOR Interest Period shall commence on the day on which the immediately preceding LIBOR Interest Period expires;
 
(ii)           if the LIBOR Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day, then it will expire on the next Business Day; if any LIBOR Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day that is not a Business Day and such day is the last Business Day of a calendar month, such LIBOR Interest Period shall expire on the Business Day next preceding such day;

(iv)          no LIBOR Interest Period shall be selected under any Term Loan Facility if, in order to make scheduled repayments of such Term Loan required pursuant to Subsection 1.6(A)(ii), (iii) or (iv), repayment of all or any portion of the LIBOR Loan prior to the expiration of such Interest Period would be necessary; and
(v)           no LIBOR Interest Period shall be selected under the Revolver Facility that extends beyond the date set forth in clause (B) of the definition of Revolver Expiration Date, and no LIBOR Interest Period shall be selected under any Term Loan Facility that extends beyond the date set forth in clause (B) of the definition of applicable Term Loan Maturity Date.

The date of funding or conversion of a LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate Loan and the first day of a LIBOR Interest Period shall be included in the calculation of interest.  The date of payment (as determined in Subsection 1.5) of any Loan and the last day of a LIBOR Interest Period shall be excluded from the calculation of interest; provided, if a Loan is repaid on the same day that it is made, one (1) day's interest shall be charged.
Calculation and Payment
 
Interest accruing on Base Rate Loans is payable in arrears on each of the following dates or events: (i) the last day of each calendar quarter; (ii) the prepayment (including the payment of any Swingline Loan pursuant to Subsection 1.1(G)(iv)) of such Loan (or portion thereof), to the extent accrued on the principal prepaid; and (iii) the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date or the Revolver Expiration Date, as the case may be, whether by acceleration or otherwise, with respect to the principal to be repaid.  Interest accruing on each LIBOR Loan is payable in arrears on each of the following dates or events: (1) the last day of each applicable LIBOR Interest Period; (2) if the LIBOR Interest Period is longer than three (3) months, on each three-month anniversary of the commencement date of such LIBOR Interest Period; (3) the prepayment of such Loan (or portion thereof), to the extent accrued on the principal prepaid; and (4) the applicable Term Loan Maturity Date or the Revolver Expiration Date, as the case may be, whether by acceleration or otherwise, with respect to the principal to be repaid.
 
(E)           .

If under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any of the other Loan Documents at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the limit of such validity prescribed by
Excess Interest
Applicable Law then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limit of such validity and if under or from circumstances whatsoever Lenders or any Lender should ever receive as interest any amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, the amount of such interest that is excessive shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Obligations evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest.  Additionally, should the method used for calculating interest on LIBOR Loans (i.e., using a 360-day year) be unlawful, such calculation method shall be automatically changed to a 365-6-day year or such other lawful calculation method as is reasonably acceptable to Administrative Agent.  This provision shall control every other provision of this Agreement and all provisions of every other Loan Document.

Each LIBOR Loan shall be made under any one of the Revolver Facility, the Term Loan A-1 Facility, the Term Loan A-2 Facility, or any Incremental Term Loan Facility, but may not be made under more than one Facility concurrently.  During any period in which any Event of Default is continuing, as the Interest Periods for LIBOR Loans then in effect expire, such Loans shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan and the LIBOR option will not be available to Borrower until all Events of Default are cured or waived. In the event Borrower fails to elect a LIBOR Loan upon any advance hereunder or upon the termination of any Interest Period, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to have such amount constitute a Base Rate Loan.  There shall be no more than an aggregate of five (5) LIBOR Loans outstanding at any one time under any Facility.

Availability of Lender's Pro Rata Share
 
(i)            .  Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any borrowing that such Lender will not make available to Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such borrowing, Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Subsection 8.4 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to Borrower the amount of such interest paid by Borrower for such period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable borrowing to Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such borrowing.  Any payment by Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to Administrative Agent.  Nothing in this Subsection or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to require Administrative Agent (or any other Lender) to advance funds on behalf of any Lender or to relieve any Lender from its obligations to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that Administrative Agent or Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
 
(ii)           Nothing contained in this Subsection 8.5(B) will be deemed to relieve a Lender of its obligation to fulfill its commitments or to prejudice any rights Administrative Agent or Borrower may have against such Lender as a result of a default by such Lender under this Agreement.
 
(iii)          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender shall be obligated to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan made after any Event of Default or acceleration of the Obligations with respect to any draw on a Letter of Credit.
 
(C)          .  Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Lenders, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to Administrative Agent
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Lender, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
 
(D)          .  If Administrative Agent determines at any time that any amount received by Administrative Agent under this Agreement must be returned to Borrower or paid to any other Person pursuant to any solvency law or otherwise, then, notwithstanding any other term or condition of this Agreement, Administrative Agent will not be required to distribute any portion thereof to any Lender.  In addition, each Lender will repay to Administrative Agent on demand any portion of such amount that Administrative Agent has distributed to such Lender, together with interest at such rate, if any, as Administrative Agent is required to pay to Borrower or such other Person, without set-off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind.
Return of Payments
 
9.1          .  Each Loan Party agrees to indemnify, pay, and hold each Agent Party and each Lender and its respective Affiliates and the respective partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys, advisors and representatives of each Lender and its respective Affiliates (the "") harmless from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses (including reasonable fees of attorneys and consultants), damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits and claims of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Indemnitee as a result of Administrative Agent and each Lender being a party to this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (A) in the absence of a conflict of interest, the Loan Parties shall only be required to pay the fees and expenses of one law firm for Administrative Agent and the Lenders (in addition to the expenses of local and special counsel for Administrative Agent and the Lenders) and (B) the Loan Parties shall have no obligation to an Indemnitee hereunder with respect to liabilities arising from the gross negligence, willful misconduct of, or breach of any Loan Document by, that Indemnitee, in each such case as determined by a final non appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction.  To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of Credit, or the use of the proceeds thereof.  No Indemnitee referred to in this paragraph shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Guaranty of Secured Obligations by Guarantors

The Guaranty
merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, to Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties of any and all Secured Obligations.  If any or all of the Secured Obligations become due and payable hereunder, each Guarantor unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties, on order, or demand, together with any and all reasonable expenses which may be incurred by Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties in collecting any of the Secured Obligations.  Each Guarantor hereby agrees that this is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection only.
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other of the Loan Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under Applicable Law (including any Debtor Relief Law).

The contribution agreement in this paragraph is intended only to define the relative rights of the Guarantors and nothing set forth in this paragraph is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, to pay any amounts as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof.
 
Each Guarantor's maximum obligations hereunder (the "") in any case or proceeding referred to below (but only in such a case or proceeding) shall not be in excess of:
Maximum Guarantor Liability

Any Secured Party may, at its election, foreclose on any security held by it by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is permitted by and conducted in accordance with Applicable Law), or exercise any other right or remedy any Secured Party may have against Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the indebtedness has been paid.

(ii)           Each of the Guarantors waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, all presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, notices of nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness.  Each of the Guarantors assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that none of the Secured Parties shall have any duty to advise such Guarantor of information known to it regarding such circumstances or risks.
 
(iii)          Until the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and tax gross-up payment for which no claim has been asserted) have been indefeasibly and irrevocably paid in full in cash, each of the Guarantors hereby waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may

Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or agreement to withhold the exercise of its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification such Guarantor may have against Borrower or against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution such Guarantor may have against any such other Guarantor or Other Party, shall be junior and subordinate to any rights any Secured Party may have against Borrower, to all right, title and interest any Secured Party may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right any Secured Party may have against such other Guarantor or Other Party.  If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification or contribution rights at any time when all Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnity, expense reimbursement and tax gross-up payment for which no claim has been asserted) shall not have been indefeasibly and irrevocably paid in full in cash and no commitments of Administrative Agent or any Lender which would give rise to any Obligations are outstanding, such amount shall be held in trust for Administrative Agent on behalf of Secured Parties and shall forthwith be paid over to Administrative Agent for the benefit of Secured Parties to be credited and applied against the Secured Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms hereof.

Beverly, MA
(August 1, 2012)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012.
 
Second Quarter/First Half 2012 Financial Results
 
"Profitability significantly increased in the second quarter primarily as a result of the anticipated expense reductions and the operating efficiencies we achieved in our U.S. retail wireless business. Additionally, our results for the period benefitted from higher international wireless revenues, which partially offset lower U.S. retail wireless revenues that resulted from the net subscriber attrition we experienced during the transition period last year," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer. "In fact, this marks the first quarter since the Alltel acquisition was completed in April 2010 that we experienced an overall net gain in subscribers, and while there is still work to be done to attract more postpaid customers, we are pleased to have reached this milestone.  The positive trends of our U.S. prepaid subscribers and the initial response to our Walmart retail launch is encouraging.  In the third quarter, however, we will experience a high percentage of contract expirations, which combined with seasonality are likely to result in somewhat lower subscriber levels for the period.
 
"Our international wireless business continued to perform well in the second quarter with operating results benefitting from higher revenues and further expense synergies following our May 2011 merger in Bermuda. U.S. wholesale revenues were stable year-on-year and increased 9% sequentially due to seasonal factors," Mr. Prior said.
 
Total revenues for the second quarter were $185.3 million, a 4% decrease from the $193.8 million reported for the second quarter of 2011, reflecting lower U.S. retail wireless revenues, partially offset by higher international wireless revenues and equipment sales.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2012 second quarter was $49.7 million, 55% above the $32.0 million reported in the 2011 second quarter, led by the strong performance of our U.S. Wireless and Island Wireless segments, where adjusted EBITDA increased by $18.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease of $2.6 million in the International Integrated Telephony segment. Second quarter 2011 U.S. Wireless segment results were impacted by significant costs associated with the transition of the acquired Alltel wireless assets and other one-time items, totaling approximately $14.8 million. Total operating income for the second quarter of 2012 was
 
(1)  See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
$23.1 million, a 267% increase over the $6.3 million reported in last year's second quarter. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $10.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, more than five times the $1.8 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, reported in last year's second quarter.
 
"First half 2012 results illustrate the solid earnings capability of our diversified portfolio of telecom service assets. We continue to deleverage while also maintaining a high level of investment in our networks.  This strategy has provided us with an even stronger balance sheet and offers us the flexibility to rapidly increase internal and  external investments as the circumstances and opportunities arise," Mr. Prior said.
 
Total revenues for the first six months of 2012 were $368.2 million compared to $381.9 in last year's first half, a decrease of 4%.  Adjusted EBITDA was $94.8 million, up 41% year-over-year; operating income increased 147% to $41.2 million; and net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $19.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, more than three times the $6.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share reported for last year's first half.
 
Second Quarter 2012 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses were $135.6 million compared to $147.3 million in the second quarter of 2011.
 
U.S. Retail wireless service revenues
were $84.1 million, 12% below the $95.4 million reported in the 2011 second quarter.  This decrease was due to net subscriber attrition that the Company experienced during the post-acquisition period in 2011. At the end of the 2012 second quarter, the Company had approximately 584,000 U.S. retail subscribers, a decrease of 9% from the approximately 639,000 subscribers the Company had at the end of last year's second quarter.  This quarter marked the first in which the Company experienced net subscriber additions since acquiring its U.S. retail wireless business in April 2010.  The Company is entering a period of higher than normal contract expirations, which in conjunction with a seasonal decline in subscriber additions, will likely lead to somewhat lower subscriber levels for the third quarter of 2012.  Of the total subscribers at June 30, 2012, approximately 442,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 142,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on the Company's U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. Wholesale wireless revenues
were $51.6 million, comparable to the $51.9 million reported in the second quarter of 2011. Data revenues accounted for 51% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 42% a year earlier. Data volume growth has continued to largely offset the impact of the decline in the minutes of use for voice traffic, consistent with industry trends.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including the U.S. Virgin Islands. International wireless revenues were $20.3 million, an increase of 10% over the $18.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2011. This increase primarily resulted from the Company's merger of its Bermuda operations with another wireless carrier in May 2011 and subscriber growth in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Wireline revenues were $20.9 million, essentially level with the amount reported in the second quarter of 2011.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana, iii) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean (including the U.S. Virgin Islands) and iv) U.S. Wireline. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended June 30, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
 
 
(1) Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2012 were $79.8 million. Long-term debt was $258.2 million. For the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $58.6 million and $79.6 million for the first half of 2012.  Second quarter capital expenditures were $13.2 million, and $32.3 million for the first half of 2012. The Company expects full year 2012 capital expenditures in the range of $80 to $95 million, of which $45 to $55 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other matters, our future financial performance and results of operations; the competitive environment in our key markets, demand for our services and industry trends; the outcome of regulatory matters; our continued access to the credit and capital markets; the pace of our network expansion and improvement, including our level of estimated future capital expenditures and our realization of the benefits of these investments; and management's plans and strategy for the future. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results.  Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1)  the general performance of our operations, including operating margins, wholesale revenues, and the future retention and turnover of our subscriber base; (2) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements; (3) increased competition; (4) economic, political and other risks facing our foreign operations; (5) the loss of certain FCC and other licenses, USF funds or other regulatory
 
changes affecting our businesses; (6) rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (7) any loss of any key members of management; (8) our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure and retail wireless business; (9) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of our network capacity and customer service system to support our customer growth; (10) the occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes; (11) our continued access to capital and credit markets; and (12) our ability to realize the value that we believe exists in our businesses. These and other additional factors that may cause actual future events and results to differ materially from the events and results indicated in the forward-looking statements above are set forth more fully under Item 1A "Risk Factors" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2012 and in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, filed with the SEC on May 10, 2012. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors that may affect such forward-looking statements.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, impairment of intangible assets, gain on disposition of long-lived assets, other income or expense, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the Alltel transaction. ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this press release.

Beverly, MA
(October 29, 2012)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012.
 
Third Quarter/Nine Months 2012 Financial Results
 
"In addition to benefitting from seasonal factors, this year's strong third quarter performance reflected our ability to achieve operating efficiencies and expense reductions in our U.S. retail wireless business," said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer.  "Our team has done a good job of managing expenses without impacting service levels. We posted our second consecutive quarter of net subscriber growth in what is, for the industry, a seasonally weak quarter for net subscriber additions. On the other hand, positive subscriber metrics continued to be driven by increases in the prepaid subscriber base as the currently high number of contract expirations contributed to another decline in postpaid subscriber levels and higher churn. Gaining additional traction with postpaid subscribers remains a key priority.
 
"Our international wireless business had another solid quarter thanks to subscriber growth in multiple markets and additional operating efficiencies.  Wireline revenues were relatively stable for the quarter and we continue to make significant progress on our fiber network builds in the northeast U.S., which should allow for future revenue growth in this area," Mr. Prior added.
 
Total revenues for the third quarter were $188.8 million, a 3% decrease from the $194.3 million reported for the third quarter of 2011, but up 1.9% sequentially.   The year-over-year decline resulted from lower U.S. retail and wholesale wireless revenues, which were partially offset by higher international wireless revenues and equipment sales. The sequential increase reflected seasonally higher U.S. wholesale wireless revenue and the growing international wireless revenue that together more than compensated for lower U.S. retail wireless revenues.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2012 third quarter was $55.7 million, 7% above the $52.1 million reported in the 2011 third quarter, led by the strong performance of our U.S. Wireless and Island Wireless segments, where adjusted
 
(1)  See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
EBITDA increased by $3.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively.  Operating income for the third quarter of 2012 was $29.6 million, a 7% increase over the $27.6 million reported in last year's third quarter. Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $16.0 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, a 41% increase over the $11.3 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, reported in last year's third quarter.
 
Total revenues for the first nine months of 2012 were $557.0 million compared to $576.3 in last year's first nine months, a decrease of 3%.  Adjusted EBITDA was $150.5 million, up 26% year-over-year; operating income increased 60% to $70.9 million; and net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $35.8 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, more than double the $17.6 million or $1.14 per diluted share reported for last year's first nine months.
 
"We reported strong operating performance for the first nine months of 2012 which has driven significant growth in our operating cash flow and added to an already robust balance sheet. We were pleased to pass along to our stockholders the benefits of ATN's recent and long-term cash flow and profit growth by increasing our quarterly cash dividend by nearly 9%  our 14
th
 consecutive annual increase," Mr. Prior noted.
 
Third Quarter 2012 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses were $138.2 million compared to $146.2 million in the third quarter of 2011, a decrease of 6%.
 
U.S. retail wireless service revenues
were $83.3 million, 7% below the $89.1 million reported in the 2011 third quarter.  This decrease was due to net subscriber attrition that the Company experienced during 2011. At the end of the 2012 third quarter, the Company had approximately 585,000 U.S. retail subscribers, a decrease of 1% from the approximately 593,000 subscribers the Company had at the end of last year's third quarter. However, despite a high percentage of contract expirations, this quarter marked the second consecutive quarter in which the Company experienced net subscriber additions in its U.S. retail wireless business.  The 2012 fourth quarter will be another period of higher-than-average contract expirations, which is likely to result in a decrease in postpaid subscribers, despite being a seasonally strong quarter for new subscriber additions.  Of the total subscribers at September 30, 2012, approximately 432,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 153,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on the Company's U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. wholesale wireless revenues
were $54.9 million, a decrease of 4% from the $57.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2011. Consistent with industry trends, voice traffic continued to decline in comparison with the prior year, partially offset by increased data usage. Data roaming revenue for certain of the Company's coverage areas is currently expected to decline over time, however, as roaming partners increase their data network coverage and capacity in those areas.  Data revenues accounted for 52% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 46% a year earlier. As previously disclosed, one of the Company's roaming partners exercised a call option in July 2012 to repurchase spectrum and related cell sites in the midwestern U.S. for approximately $15.8 million. The transaction is expected to be completed in late 2012. For the first nine months of 2012, the Company's wholesale revenue from these network assets amounted to approximately $12 million.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean, including some of the smaller island markets. International wireless revenues were $21.0 million, an increase of 3% over the $20.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2011. This increase primarily resulted from subscriber growth in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, its integrated voice and data operations in New England and its wholesale transport operations in New York State. Wireline revenues were $21.1 million, a 3% decline from the $21.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2011, primarily resulting from slightly lower wireline revenues in Guyana.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: i) U.S. Wireless, ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana, iii) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean (including the U.S. Virgin Islands) and iv) U.S. Wireline. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended September 30, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):

Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2012 were $111.4 million. Long-term debt was $254.6 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $57.9 million for the third quarter and $137.5 million for the first nine months of 2012.  Capital expenditures were $18.2 million for the third quarter and $50.5 million for the first nine months of 2012. The Company expects full year 2012 capital expenditures in the range of $65 to $85 million, of which $35 to $50 million is expected to be allocated to the U.S. Wireless segment.  The company had originally projected $90 to $110 million of capital expenditures.  The reduced forecast is largely the result of expenditures that the Company now expects to make in 2013, rather than in 2012.

Cautionary Language Concerning Forward Looking Statements
 
This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other matters, our future financial performance and results of operations; the competitive environment in our key markets, demand for our services and industry trends; the outcome of regulatory matters; our continued access to the credit and capital markets; the pace of our network expansion and improvement, including our level of estimated future capital expenditures and our realization of the benefits of these investments; and management's plans and strategy for the future. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results.  Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1)  the general performance of our operations, including operating margins, wholesale revenues, and the future retention and turnover of our subscriber base; (2) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements; (3) increased competition; (4) economic, political and other risks facing our foreign operations; (5) the loss of certain FCC and other licenses, USF funds or other regulatory changes affecting our businesses; (6) rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (7) any loss of any key members of management; (8) our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure and retail wireless business; (9) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of our network capacity and customer service system to support our customer growth; (10) the occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes; (11) our continued access to capital and credit markets; and (12) our ability to realize the value that we believe exists in our businesses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN, Inc. stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, impairment of intangible assets, gain on disposition of long-lived assets, other income or expense, bargain purchase gain, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the Alltel transaction. ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating
performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures
 
included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this press release.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), a telecommunications service provider to rural, niche and other under-served markets, today announced it has agreed to sell its domestic retail wireless business operated under the Alltel name by ATNs subsidiary Allied Wireless Communications Corporation (Allied).  AT&T will purchase the operations in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $780 million.
BEVERLY, Mass., January 22, 2013 --
Allied, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, serves approximately 585,000 customers in rural areas of six states  Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Illinois, Ohio and Idaho, and generated revenues for the first nine months of 2012 of approximately $350 million.  In ATNs public filings, these operations are consolidated within its U.S. Wireless segment.  These operations generated operating income estimated to be approximately $34 million, which is net of depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $42 million, for the first nine months of 2012.
We are pleased that AT&T recognizes the value of our U.S. wireless retail operations and is acquiring these assets, said Michael T. Prior, Chief Executive Officer.  Alltels customers will benefit from access to a nationwide 4G network, a larger device selection, additional retail locations and a broader range of product offerings.  Additionally, many of our employees should benefit from new career opportunities within AT&T.  We will work closely with AT&T to close the transaction and to ensure a smooth transition for our customers and employees.
Commenting on the use of proceeds once the transaction is completed, Mr. Prior said, We have a disciplined, long-term approach to managing our portfolio and intend to balance the use of the after-tax proceeds among new acquisition opportunities, a possible reduction in debt outstanding, investments in our existing lines of business and returns to shareholders through dividends.
The transaction is subject to customary closing terms and conditions and regulatory approval from the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission. The companies expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2013.
 
 
 
 
Following the close of the sale, Atlantic Tele-Networks businesses will consist of Commnet, serving rural communities primarily in the Southwest U.S.; Sovernet, serving residential and business customers in New England; ION, serving rural communities in New York State; GT&T, serving Guyana; CellOne, serving Bermuda; and Choice, Islandcom and Mio, serving portions of the Caribbean islands.
 
Stephens, Inc. is serving as financial advisor to Atlantic Tele-Network and provided a fairness opinion for the transaction.  Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP and Jenner & Block are providing legal counsel.

If, after notice thereof, the Indemnifying Party fails to promptly assume the defense of a Third Party Claim for which indemnification is claimed hereunder (but in any event within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of the Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party), or, after having assumed defense of such claim, fails to diligently conduct such defense, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense thereof, and shall be indemnified for the cost and expense of such defense (to the extent such Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder).  If the Indemnified Party shall have employed counsel as described in the foregoing sentences, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be included in the calculation of Losses with respect to the Third Party Claim.  No Indemnified Party may be bound by any compromise or settlement of a Third Party Claim without its consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless () the sole relief is monetary damages for which the Indemnified Party shall be fully indemnified, and () there is no finding or admission of any violation of Law or rights of any person or entity.  The Indemnified Party shall not compromise or settle any Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such compromise or settlement (A) does result in any indemnifiable Losses or (B) fully releases the Indemnifying Party of any Liability under this .

Beverly, MA
(February 21, 2013)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2012.
 
Fourth Quarter/Full Year 2012 Financial Results
 
"The fourth quarter was very much in line with the year, both of which were marked by increasing profitability and operating cash flow with a decline in U.S. retail wireless revenues offsetting solid growth in international wireless revenues," said Michael Prior, Chief Executive Officer.  "Increased operating profitability in both the quarter and full year 2012 was driven primarily by the elimination of duplicate expenses and other cost reduction initiatives in our U.S. wireless business.  Both revenue and profitability for the year were also positively impacted by improvements in several of our international wireless properties, particularly Bermuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 
"Our wireless subscriber metrics in the fourth quarter had mixed results.  On the positive side, our international wireless subscriber base continued to increase and we repeated the pattern of recent quarters with solid prepaid subscriber growth domestically.  On the negative side, we continue to struggle with the operating challenges from the dispersed, rural geography of our U.S. postpaid customer base, which we discussed recently in
 
 
announcing our agreement to sell our main U.S. retail wireless business.  Within that context, our team has done an excellent job of maintaining domestic ARPU and focusing on delivering high quality service to our customers.
 
"In the fourth quarter, U.S. wholesale revenues remained consistent with the prior year.  Throughout the year, our roaming partners continued to overbuild, which was largely offset by growth in data volume per site.  Wireline revenue was flat for the quarter and the year.  However, that masks a more complex story as rapidly rising data and wholesale capacity revenue and U.S. enterprise sales volume are offsetting declines in traditional voice revenue and severe pricing pressure in the U.S. enterprise segment," Mr. Prior added.
 
Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $184.4 million, 1% above the $182.9 million reported for 2011.   The year-over-year increase resulted from higher international wireless revenues and equipment sales, which were largely offset by lower U.S. retail wireless service revenues.
 
Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the 2012 fourth quarter was $47.0 million, 15% above the $40.7 million reported in 2011, led by our U.S. Wireless and Island Wireless segments, where adjusted EBITDA increased by $5.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively.  Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2012 was $28.6 million, a 161% increase over the $10.9 million reported in last year's fourth quarter.  Operating income in the 2012 fourth quarter included an $11.6 million gain on the sale of spectrum and related assets used in the Company's U.S. wholesale wireless business.  Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $13.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, more than triple the $4.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, reported in last year's fourth quarter.
 
Total revenues for the full year 2012 were $741.4 million compared to $759.2 million for 2011, a decline of 2%.  Adjusted EBITDA was $197.6 million, up 23% year-over-year; operating income increased 80% to $99.5 million; and net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $48.9 million, or $3.13 per diluted share, more than double the $21.8 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, reported for 2011.
 
Commenting on full year results, Mr. Prior said, "Amidst a challenging operating environment, we continued to build the value of our assets in 2012, reporting record operating cash flow of $187.5 million and further strengthening our balance sheet.  This performance supports our strategy of investing for the long term with a keen focus on delivering steady cash returns on our investments."
 
Recent Corporate Developments
 
                 
On January 22, 2013, the Company announced a definitive agreement to sell its U.S. retail wireless business operating under the Alltel name to AT&T.  Under the terms of the agreement, AT&T will purchase the operations in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $780 million.  The acquisition, which is currently expected to be completed in the second half of 2013, is subject to customary closing conditions, including completion of the required reviews and approvals by the Department of Justice and Federal Communications Commission.  This business is reported as part of the U.S. Wireless segment, and for the fourth quarter of 2012 it generated revenues, operating income and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $114.7 million, $7.1 million and $21.9 million, respectively.  For the year, revenues, operating income and adjusted EBITDA were approximately $464.4 million, $41.4 million and $98.5 million, respectively.
                 
On December 7, 2012, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, payable on December 31, 2012, on all common shares outstanding to stockholders of record as of December 20, 2012.  The quarterly dividend was raised 8.7% to $0.25 per share on September 14, 2012, which represented the Company's 14
th
 consecutive annual dividend increase.
 
Fourth Quarter 2012 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses were $131.8 million compared to $134.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, a decrease of 2%.
 
(1)  See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
 
U.S. retail wireless service revenues
were $83.7 million, 3% below the $86.0 million reported in the 2011 fourth quarter.  This decrease was due to net postpaid subscriber attrition that the Company experienced throughout 2012. At the end of the 2012 fourth quarter, the Company had approximately 588,000 U.S. retail subscribers, an increase of 1% from the approximately 580,000 subscribers the Company had at the end of last year's fourth quarter. Despite a higher percentage of contract expirations, this quarter marked the third consecutive quarter in which the Company experienced net subscriber additions in its U.S. retail wireless business, driven by growth in prepaid subscribers.  The 2013 first quarter will be another period of higher-than-average contract expirations, which is likely to result in further decreases in postpaid subscribers.  Of the total subscribers at December 31, 2012, approximately 425,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 163,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on the Company's U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. wholesale wireless revenues
were $48.1 million, a decrease of less than 1% from the $48.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2011. Consistent with industry trends, voice traffic continued to decline in comparison with the prior year, mainly offset by increased data usage. Roaming revenue, including data roaming revenue, for certain of the Company's coverage areas is currently expected to decline over time as roaming partners increase their data network coverage and capacity in those areas.  Data revenues accounted for 52% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 46% a year earlier. As previously disclosed, one of the Company's roaming partners exercised a call option in July 2012 to repurchase spectrum and related cell sites in the midwestern U.S. for approximately $15.6 million. The transaction was completed late in the fourth quarter of 2012, resulting in a gain on disposition of long-lived assets of approximately $11.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company's wholesale revenue from these network assets amounted to approximately $16.0 million.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean. International wireless revenues were $21.3 million, an increase of 10% over the $19.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2011. At the end of 2012, the Company had approximately 333,000 international wireless subscribers of which 88% were prepaid subscribers.  This is an increase of approximately 3% from approximately 322,000 wireless subscribers at the end of 2011.  Each of the Company's international subsidiaries experienced moderate year-over-year growth in wireless revenues in the fourth quarter of 2012.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are primarily generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, and by its integrated voice and data and wholesale transport operations in New England and New York State. Wireline revenues were $21.3 million, a 2% decline from the $21.7 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily resulting from lower wireline revenues in Guyana.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: (i) U.S. Wireless; (ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana; (iii) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean (including the U.S. Virgin Islands); and (iv) U.S. Wireline. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended December 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):
 
 
 
(1) Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2012 were $136.6 million. Long-term debt was $250.9 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $50.0 million for the fourth quarter and $187.5 million for full year 2012.  Capital expenditures were $26.9 million for the fourth quarter and $77.4 million for full year 2012, lower than expected because of a delay in certain capital projects. The Company expects full year 2013 capital expenditures in the range of $95 to $105 million, assuming the Alltel sale transaction proceeds as anticipated in 2013.

This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other matters, our future financial performance and results of operations; our proposed sale of our Alltel operations and the expected timetable for the completion of such sale; the competitive environment in our key markets, demand for our services and industry trends; the outcome of regulatory matters; our continued access to the credit and capital markets; the pace of our network expansion and improvement, including our level of estimated future capital expenditures and our realization of the benefits of these investments; and management's plans and strategy for the future. These forward-looking statements are based on estimates, projections, beliefs, and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or results.  Actual future events and results could differ materially from the events and results indicated in these statements as a result of many factors, including, among others, (1)  the general performance of our operations, including operating margins, wholesale revenues, and the future retention and turnover of our subscriber base; (2) our ability to receive requisite regulatory consents and approvals and satisfy other conditions needed to complete our proposed sale of our Alltel operations; (3) our ability to maintain favorable roaming arrangements; (4) increased competition; (5) economic, political and other risks facing our foreign operations; (6) the loss of certain FCC and other licenses, USF funds or other regulatory changes affecting our businesses; (7) rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; (8) any loss of any key members of management; (9) our reliance on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure and retail wireless business; (10) the adequacy and expansion capabilities of our network capacity and customer service system to support our customer growth; (11) the occurrence of severe weather and natural catastrophes; (12) our continued access to capital and credit markets; and (13) our ability to realize the value that we believe exists in our businesses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, impairment of intangible assets, gain on disposition of long-lived assets, other income or expense, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods, without the distortion of the recent increased expenses associated with the Alltel transaction. ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this press release.

Beverly, MA
(April 29, 2013)  Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNI), today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013.
 
First Quarter 2013 Financial Results
 
"First quarter results were mixed," said Michael Prior, Atlantic Tele-Network's Chief Executive Officer.  "On the positive side, we maintained stable operating income and EBITDA margins, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin was 25%.  Our international wireless business continued to perform well, with solid revenue and operating income improvements achieved across our Island Wireless properties.  Also, we experienced consistent year-over-year performance from our legacy wholesale business, following the Midwest U.S. spectrum sale which closed at the end of 2012.  On the other hand, despite diligent efforts to grow our U.S. retail subscriber base, including continued strength in the prepaid segment, revenues continued to be negatively affected by post-paid customer attrition, and we began to see declines in our wholesale revenue within the Alltel markets in the first quarter.  We hope to be able to moderate the Alltel postpaid subscriber losses in coming quarters through an improved device lineup, which now includes the iPhone.  In another positive development, the waiting period for the Alltel sale transaction under the Hart Scott Rodino Anti-trust
 
Improvements Act has expired, and we anticipate closing in the second half of this year, pending receipt of all regulatory approvals."
 
Total revenues for the first quarter were $172.9 million, 6% below the $183.1 million reported for the first quarter of 2012.  The year-over-year decrease resulted from lower U.S. wireless revenues in both the wholesale and retail lines of business, partially offset by higher international wireless revenues and equipment sales.
 
Adjusted EBITDA
(1) 
for the 2013 first quarter was $43.3 million, 4% below the $45.2 million reported in the 2012 first quarter, as a result of the revenue decline in the Company's U.S. Wireless segment, partially offset by improved profitability in the Company's Island Wireless segment.  Operating income for the first quarter of 2013 was $17.8 million, a 2% decrease from the $18.1 million reported in last year's first quarter.  Operating income in the 2013 first quarter included a $1.1 million gain on the sale of wholesale wireless assets.  Net income attributable to ATN's stockholders was $8.8 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, as compared to the $9.3 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, reported in last year's first quarter.
 
First Quarter 2013 Operating Highlights
 
U.S. Wireless Service Revenues
 
U.S. wireless service revenues include voice and data service revenues from the Company's prepaid and postpaid retail operations as well as its wholesale roaming operations. Total service revenues from the U.S. wireless businesses were $121.6 million compared to $134.1 million in the first quarter of 2012, a decrease of 9%.
 
U.S. retail wireless service revenues
were $81.3 million, 6% below the $86.7 million reported in the 2012 first quarter.  This decrease was due to net postpaid subscriber attrition that the Company experienced throughout the past year. At the end of the 2013 first quarter, the Company had approximately 590,000 U.S. retail subscribers, an increase of 2% from the approximately 579,000 subscribers the Company had at the end of last year's first quarter. Despite a higher percentage of contract expirations, this quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter in which the Company experienced positive net subscriber additions in its U.S. retail wireless business, driven by growth in prepaid subscribers.  The 2013 second quarter will be another period of higher-than-average contract expirations that is likely to result in further decreases in postpaid subscribers, although the launch of the iPhone late in the first quarter is expected to improve customer churn.  Of the total subscribers at March 31, 2013, approximately 413,000 were postpaid subscribers and approximately 177,000 were prepaid subscribers. Additional operating data on the Company's U.S. retail wireless business can be found in Table 4 of this release.
 
U.S. wholesale wireless revenues
were $40.3 million, a decrease of 15% from the $47.4 million reported in the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter 2013 wholesale revenues were negatively impacted by the sale of certain spectrum and related cell sites in the Midwestern U.S. which was completed late in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Additionally, wholesale revenues declined, primarily in the Alltel markets, as a result of roaming partners increasing their coverage and capacity in certain areas where they previously relied on the Company for coverage.  Data revenues accounted for 53% of wholesale wireless revenues for the quarter, compared to 48% a year earlier.
 
International Wireless Revenues
 
International wireless revenues include retail and wholesale voice and data wireless revenues from international operations in Bermuda and the Caribbean. International wireless revenues were $21.4 million, an increase of 13% over the $18.9 million reported in the first quarter of 2012.  This increase was largely due to subscriber growth and strong seasonal roaming revenues within the Island Wireless segment. At the end of the first quarter of 2013, the Company had approximately 335,000 international wireless subscribers of which 88% were prepaid subscribers.  This is an increase of approximately 6% from approximately 315,000 wireless subscribers at the end of the first quarter of 2012.  Each of the Company's international subsidiaries experienced solid year-over-year growth in wireless revenues in the first quarter of 2013.
 
(1)  See Table 5 for reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.
 
Wireline Revenues
 
Wireline revenues are primarily generated by the Company's wireline operations in Guyana, including international telephone calls into and out of that country, and by its integrated voice and data and wholesale transport operations in New England and New York State. Wireline revenues were $20.6 million, a 5% decline from the $21.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2012, primarily resulting from lower wireline revenues in Guyana.
 
Reportable Operating Segments
 
The Company has four reportable segments: (i) U.S. Wireless; (ii) International Integrated Telephony, which operates in Guyana; (iii) Island Wireless, which generates its revenues and has its assets located in Bermuda and the Caribbean (including the U.S. Virgin Islands); and (iv) U.S. Wireline. Financial data on our reportable operating segments for the three months ended March 31, 2013 are as follows (in thousands):
 
 
(1) Reconciling items are comprised of corporate general and administrative costs and acquisition-related charges.
 
On January 22, 2013, the Company announced a definitive agreement to sell its U.S. retail wireless business operating under the Alltel name to AT&T for a cash purchase price of $780.0 million.  This business is reported as part of the U.S. Wireless segment, and for the first quarter of 2013 it generated revenues, adjusted EBITDA and operating income of approximately $108.0 million, $20.2 million and $5.3 million, respectively.
 
Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights
 
Cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2013 were $140.8 million.  Long-term debt was $247.3 million.  Net cash provided by operating activities was $25.0 million for the first quarter of 2013.  Capital expenditures were $20.9 million for the first quarter.  The Company expects full year 2013 capital expenditures in the range of $95 to $105 million, assuming the Alltel sale transaction is completed as anticipated in 2013.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, ATN has presented Adjusted EBITDA and ARPU measures. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income attributable to ATN stockholders before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, acquisition related charges, impairment of intangible assets, gain on disposition of long-lived assets, other income or expense, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. ARPU, or monthly average revenue per subscriber/unit, is computed by dividing total retail service revenues per period by the weighted average number of subscribers with service during that period, and then dividing that result by the number of months in the period.  The Company believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures helps investors to gain a meaningful understanding of the Company's core operating results and enhance comparing such performance with prior periods. ATN's management uses these non-GAAP measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, as the basis for measuring our core operating performance and comparing such performance to that of prior periods. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this news release are not meant to be considered superior to or a substitute for results of operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this news release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are set forth in the text of, and the accompanying tables to, this press release.
