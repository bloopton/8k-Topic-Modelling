Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure The following information is being furnished pursuant to "Item 9 Regulation FD Disclosure" and is also being furnished pursuant to "Item 12 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216. On April 29, 2003, Balchem Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99 to this report.
SIGNATURE Under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the authorized undersigned. BALCHEM CORPORATION By:/s/ Dino A. Rossi ------------------------- Dino A. Rossi, President, Chief Executive Officer Dated: April 29, 2003 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated April 29, 2003, reporting Balchem's financial results for the first quarter of 2003.
April 29, 2003 BALCHEM CORPORATION (BCP - AMEX) -------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the Quarter ended March 31, 2003 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) For the Three Months Ended March 31 ----------------------------------- 2003 2002 ---- ---- Net Sales $ 14,816 $ 14,389 Gross Profit 5,651 5,294 Operating Expenses 2,894 2,868 ----------- ----------- Earnings from Operations 2,757 2,426 Other Expense (Income) 73 86 ----------- ------------ Earnings Before Income Tax Expense 2,684 2,340 Income Tax Expense 1,001 902 ----------- ------------ Net Earnings $ 1,683 $ 1,438 =========== ============ Basic Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.35 $ 0.31 Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.34 $ 0.29 First quarter records were achieved in both net sales and net income. Net sales increased 3.0%, while net earnings increased 17.0%. These results of the first quarter were as we expected, especially in light of the continued difficult economic environment. With consumers everywhere watching the dollars they spend, and customers around the world carefully managing inventory levels, we were pleased with our record sales and solid profit performance. Diluted net earnings per common share rose 16.7% over the comparable year quarter. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated net sales of $5.9M, up 11.1% over the comparable quarter in 2002 largely due to increased volumes sold of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization. Net sales in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment decreased 3.4%, to $6.1M. In this segment our sales into the domestic food market declined versus the prior year quarter, but were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2002. We have new products approved and ready to market as we deal with conservative customer purchasing patterns as experienced in the fourth quarter. We are also seeing delays in the timing of new product launches by customers and prospects reflecting the intense competitive situation facing most food retailers due to the current economy. Our international market did, however, realize strong growth due to a new product introduced into the confectionery industry.
Page 2 BALCHEM CORPORATION (BCP - AMEX) - -------------------------------- While the U.S. dairy industry has continued to operate at 1980 low milk prices, sales of our Reashure product for the animal health and nutrition industry have remained basically flat. We believe this is a good indication of this market understanding the value of our product. Net sales in the Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segment grew to $2.7M, or 2%, over the comparable period in 2002. This increase was driven by improved volume in all product lines. Consolidated gross profit in the quarter ended March 31, 2003 improved $0.36M, or 6.7%, over the comparable prior year period, due largely to growth in sales volume and favorable product mix. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $2.9M in the quarter, or 19.5% of net sales, as compared to 19.9% of net sales in the prior year quarter. Net earnings increased 17.0% over the comparable quarter of 2002. Basic and fully diluted earnings per common share rose 13.4% and 16.7% over the comparable quarter for 2002 respectively. Cash flow from operations continued to be strong in the quarter, allowing the Company to reduce long term debt by $0.4 million and complete $0.8 million of capital projects. Outlook: Commenting on the outlook for 2003, Mr. Dino A. Rossi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Balchem, said "We will continue to focus on being a leader in the market segments in which the Company operates. Having built scale in 2002, we are now focused on reducing costs and optimizing logistics and raw materials across business segments as we exploit our technology base. Particular strength in the ARC Specialty Products segment should continue, while the Encapsulated/Nutritional segment will likely be challenged by the U.S. economy for another quarter due to current economic situations in both the dairy and domestic food markets. The Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segment is expected to see modest sales growth for the year. Our outlook for the year continues to be moderate earnings growth." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be conducted on Tuesday, April 29, 2003, at 2:00 PM EDT to review first quarter 2003 results. The call will be hosted by Dino A. Rossi, Balchem's President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, Corporate Controller. We invite you to listen to the call by dialing 800-473-6123 ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time of the conference call. The press release, and its accompanying financial exhibits, will also be available on the Company website, www.balchem.com, prior to the conference call. --------------- Segment Information Balchem Corporation consists primarily of three business segments: ARC Specialty Products, Encapsulated/Nutritional Products, and Unencapsulated Feed Supplements.

Regulation FD Disclosure The following information is being furnished pursuant to "Item 9 Regulation FD Disclosure" and is also being furnished pursuant to "Item 12 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" in accordance with SEC Release No. 33-8216. On July 28, 2003, Balchem Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99 to this report.
SIGNATURE Under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the authorized undersigned. BALCHEM CORPORATION By:/s/ Dino A. Rossi --------------------------- Dino A. Rossi, President, Chief Executive Officer Dated: July 28, 2003 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated July 28, 2003, reporting Balchem's financial results for the second quarter of 2003.

July 28, 2003 BALCHEM CORPORATION (BCP - AMEX) -------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the Quarter ended June 30, 2003 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) For the Three Months Ended June 30, ----------------------------------- 2003 2002 ---- ---- Net Sales $14,860 $15,668 Gross Profit 5,488 6,564 Operating Expenses 2,725 2,900 ------- ------- Earnings from Operations 2,763 3,664 Other Expense (Income) 71 93 ------- ------- Earnings Before Income Tax Expense 2,692 3,571 Income Tax Expense 1,001 1,366 ------- ------- Net Earnings $ 1,691 $ 2,205 ======= ======= Basic Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.35 $ 0.46 Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.34 $ 0.45 For the Six Months Ended June 30, --------------------------------- 2003 2002 ---- ---- Net Sales $29,676 $30,057 Gross Profit 11,139 11,858 Operating Expenses 5,619 5,768 ------- ------- Earnings from Operations 5,520 6,090 Other Expense (Income) 144 179 ------- ------- Earnings Before Income Tax Expense 5,376 5,911 Income Tax Expense 2,002 2,268 ------- ------- Net Earnings $ 3,374 $ 3,643 ======= ======= Basic Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.70 $ 0.77 Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.68 $ 0.74
BALCHEM CORPORATION (BCP - AMEX) Page 2 - -------------------------------- Net sales and net earnings for the second quarter ending June 30, 2003 were below the previous year quarter by 5.2% and 23.3% respectively. Consolidated results of this second quarter were nearly identical to the first quarter of 2003 reflecting the combination of factors noted in the Company's press release with respect to first quarter results. Diluted net earnings per common share declined 24.4% from the comparable prior year quarter, and were flat compared with the first quarter of 2003. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated a new quarterly record in net sales of $6.4M, an increase of 16.6% over the prior year comparable quarter. This result was largely driven by increased sales volume of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization. The BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segment generated $2.7M in net sales, for an increase of 11.1% over sales of the prior year comparable quarter, principally as a result of increased sales volume in liquid and dry choline chloride as well as other derivative products. The Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment did, however, see continued slowness, with net sales of $5.8M in the second quarter, a decline of 25.7% from the prior year comparable quarter. This segment realized continued softness in two key sectors, the U.S. food and dairy markets, contributing to a quarter of lower volume and relatively weak average prices due to product mix. The Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment continues to see conservative purchasing patterns as customers have reduced inventory levels on existing product lines and postponed marketing spending on new product launches in the U.S. food market. The operating environment for the segment continues to be challenging as customers pursue cost reductions aggressively. The U.S. dairy industry continued to operate at very low milk prices (although improving slowly in the second quarter). Sales of our Reashure(R) product for the animal nutrition and health industry continue to feel the effects of poor dairy industry economics. Consolidated gross profit in the quarter ended June 30, 2003 declined $1.1M, or 16.4%, over the comparable prior year period due largely to the decline in sales volume and lower margin product mix in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment as noted above. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $2.7M in the quarter, or 18.3% of net sales, as compared to 18.5% of net sales in the prior year quarter. Consolidated cash flow from operations continued to be strong in the quarter, as the Company reduced long term debt by $0.4 million and incurred $0.6 million of capital projects, that are focused on growth areas of the business. For the six months ended June 30, versus the comparable prior year period, consolidated net sales are off 1.3%, or $0.4 million, net earnings are down 7.4%, or $0.3 million, and diluted earnings per share declined 8.1%. The strength of the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segments was offset by the weak performance of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment. BALCHEM CORPORATION (BCP - AMEX) Page 3 - -------------------------------- Outlook ------- Commenting on the outlook for 2003, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "Strength in the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segments should continue. Our Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment, while seeing signs of volume improvement in the domestic food sector and increasing milk prices which should improve the dairy economy, will likely improve compared to the first six months of 2003; however, this segments full year sales are not expected to generate results equal to our full year results of 2002. We remain focused on exploiting our technology in each business segment and, given our current results, combined with factors affecting the Encapsulated /Nutritional Products segment, we now expect flat consolidated earnings for the year compared to 2002." Quarterly Conference Call ------------------------- A quarterly conference call will be conducted on Monday, July 28, 2003, at 2:00 PM ET to review second quarter 2003 results. Dino A. Rossi, Balchem's President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, Corporate Controller and Treasurer, will host the call. We invite you to listen to the call by dialing 800- 475-2151 ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time of the conference call. This press release, and its accompanying financial exhibits, will also be available on the Company website, www.balchem.com, prior to the conference call.

BALCHEM CORPORATION REVISES BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE THIRD QUARTER 2003 New Hampton, NY. September 18, 2003. Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) announced today that it has revised its business outlook for the third quarter of 2003. During the third quarter, the Company has realized continued softness in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment of the business, particularly in the domestic food and the animal nutrition sectors, where conservative purchasing patterns and delayed new product launches by customers in the United States continue. Commenting on the announcement, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO, stated "Weak general economic conditions, together with protracted ordering patterns and lower customer inventory levels in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment, continued beyond our earlier expectations. We have responded to these market dynamics by significantly reducing production in the quarter, to align our inventories accordingly, resulting in short-term unfavorable manufacturing costs. This action, while reducing operating income in the quarter does strengthen our balance sheet by converting inventory to cash and has positioned this segment for improved results in the fourth quarter. The Company has also realized significant increases in employee medical claims under our self-insurance program. As a result, the Company does not expect consolidated earnings for the third quarter or the full 2003 year to reach the levels for the comparable periods of 2002. On the positive side, we do expect continued strength in the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients segments as noted in the June 30, 2003 quarterly press release." About Balchem: Balchem Corporation consists primarily of three business segments: Encapsulated/Nutritional Products, ARC Specialty Products, and unencapsulated feed supplements. The Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment provides proprietary microencapsulation solutions to an expanding variety of applications. Through ARC Specialty Products, Balchem provides specialty-packaged chemicals for use in healthcare and other industries.

Dated: October 28, 2003 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated October 28, 2003, reporting Balchem's financial results for the third quarter of 2003. October 28, 2003 BALCHEM CORPORATION (BCP - AMEX) -------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the Quarter ended September 30, 2003 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) For the Three Months Ended September 30, ---------------------------------------- 2003 2002 ---- ---- Net Sales $ 15,791 $ 15,784 Gross Profit 4,657 5,998 Operating Expenses 3,260 2,594 --------- ----------- Earnings from Operations 1,397 3,404 Other Expense 62 91 --------- ----------- Earnings Before Income Tax Expense 1,335 3,313 Income Tax Expense 468 1,159 --------- ----------- Net Earnings $ 867 $ 2,154 ========= =========== Basic Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.18 $ 0.45 Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.17 $ 0.43 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, --------------------------------------- 2003 2002 ---- ---- Net Sales $ 45,467 $ 45,842 Gross Profit 15,796 17,856 Operating Expenses 8,879 8,362 --------- ----------- Earnings from Operations 6,917 9,494 Other Expense 206 270 --------- ----------- Earnings Before Income Tax Expense 6,711 9,224 Income Tax Expense 2,470 3,427 --------- ----------- Net Earnings $ 4,241 $ 5,797 ========= =========== Basic Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.88 $ 1.22 Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share $ 0.85 $ 1.17
BALCHEM CORPORATION (Amex:BCP) Page 2 - ------------------------------ Net sales for the third quarter of 2003 and 2002 respectively were comparable at $15.8 million. Net earnings for the third quarter of 2003 was $.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $2.2 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the year-ago period. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated a new quarterly record in net sales of $6.7 million, an increase of 22.2% over the prior year comparable quarter. This result was largely driven by increased sales volume of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization in both our drum cylinders and the new smaller ethylene oxide canisters in support of a supply agreement with a Fortune 200 company. The BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segment generated $3.1 million in net sales, for an increase of 15.9% over sales of the prior year comparable quarter, principally as a result of increased sales volume in liquid and dry choline chloride for the poultry and swine industries as well as other derivative products. The Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment continued to experience slowness, with net sales of $6.0 million in the third quarter, a decline of 21.2% from the prior year comparable quarter. This segment continued to experience softness in the U.S. and International food markets, as well as Animal Nutrition and Health, contributing to a quarter of lower volume and relatively weak average prices due to product and customer mix. The Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment continues to see conservative purchasing patterns as customers have reduced inventory levels on existing product lines and postpone marketing expenditures on new product launches in the U.S. food market. We continue to be impacted by domestic food customers who have struggled with competition from less expensive store brands, which is heightening the competitive nature of our business. Of particular significance, the prior year quarter included substantial sales to a single domestic food customer in support of a new product launch. While this customer's product continues to be in distribution, the Company has not realized any additional sales of its product to this customer since 2002. This accounted for approximately 80% of the sales shortfall for the quarter ending September 2003. During the quarter ended June 30, 2003 and continuing into the quarter ended September 30, 2003, the U.S. dairy industry began to show signs of improvement. However, sales of our Reashure(R) product for the animal nutrition and health industry continued to be soft into the third quarter. Consolidated gross profit in the quarter ended September 30, 2003 declined $1.3 million, or 22.4%, over the comparable prior year period due to the decline in sales volume and lower margin product mix in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment as noted above. These lower sales levels, coupled with a designed reduction in inventory levels in this one segment, negatively impacted the company's gross margins due to the resulting reduced utilization of plant manufacturing capacity. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $3.3 million in the quarter, or 20.6% of net sales, as compared to 16.4% of net sales in the prior year quarter. During the quarter, the Company continued to realize significant increases in employee medical claims under our self-insurance program, as well as increases in the Company's general business insurance premiums. The decision to reduce inventory levels, as previously mentioned in the September 18, 2003 outlook, while generating unfavorable manufacturing variances, strengthened the balance sheet of the Company. Cash flow continued to be strong in the quarter, as the Company reduced long-term debt by $0.4 million and funded from operations $0.6 million of capital projects that are focused on growth areas of the business. Our cash position has now improved approximately $3.0 million over our December 2002 balance.
BALCHEM CORPORATION (Amex:BCP) Page 3 - ------------------------------ For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, net sales were $45.5 million compared to $45.8 million in the same period last year. Net earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 was $4.2 million or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $5.8 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, for the comparable year-ago period. The strength of the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segments continues to be offset by the weak performance of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment. Outlook - ------- Commenting on the outlook for the fourth quarter and year-end 2003, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "Strength in the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segments should continue. Our Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment is seeing signs of volume improvement in the domestic food sector and improving dairy economics. However, this segment's full year sales are not expected to generate results equal to the full year results of 2002.

Item 12.

On February 12, 2004, Balchem Corporation issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2003. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99 to this report.
SIGNATURE Under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the authorized undersigned. BALCHEM CORPORATION By:/s/ Dino A. Rossi --------------------------- Dino A. Rossi, President, Chief Executive Officer Dated: February 12, 2004 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated February 12, 2004, reporting Balchem's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2003.

BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) ------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the Quarter ended December 31, 2003 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) For the Three Months Ended December 31, --------------------------------------- 2003 2002 ---- ---- Net sales $16,408 $14,356 Gross profit 5,356 5,454 Operating expenses 3,258 2,763 ------- ------- Earnings from operations 2,098 2,691 Other expense 46 70 ------- ------- Earnings before income tax expense 2,052 2,621 Income tax expense 654 1,002 ------- ------- Net earnings $ 1,398 $ 1,619 ======= ======= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.29 $ 0.34 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.28 $ 0.33 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, ---------------------------------------- 2003 2002 ---- ---- Net sales $61,875 $60,197 Gross profit 21,152 23,310 Operating expenses 12,137 11,125 ------- ------- Earnings from operations 9,015 12,185 Other expense 252 340 ------- ------- Earnings before income tax expense 8,763 11,845 Income tax expense 3,125 4,429 ------- ------- Net earnings $ 5,638 $ 7,416 ======= ======= Basic net earnings per common share $ 1.17 $ 1.56 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 1.13 $ 1.50
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) Page 2 Net sales for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2003 were a record $16.4 million, an increase of 14.3%, as compared to $14.4 million reported for the comparable period last year. Net earnings for the fourth quarter, however, were $1.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $1.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, reported for the same period last year. Net earnings for this quarter were negatively impacted by a one-time organizational charge of approximately $0.4 million pre-tax that, if stated without these charges, would reflect an earnings per diluted share of $0.33, which would be flat with the prior year quarter. The fourth quarter net sales closed the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, at a record $61.9 million, an increase of 2.8% over the net sales of $60.2 million reported for the prior comparable period. While the fourth quarter net earnings rebounded sequentially from the third quarter, they were not strong enough to offset the shortfall of the second and particularly third quarter net earnings. Net earnings for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 were $5.6 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $7.4 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, for the comparable prior year. For the fourth quarter of 2003, the ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of approximately $2.7 million on record sales of $7.2 million. Net sales were 24.7% higher than the prior year comparable quarter and earnings from operations were 37.4% higher. These results were largely driven by increased sales volume of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and sales of single use ethylene oxide canisters for sterilization use in medical facilities. The BCP Ingredients segment, which markets unencapsulated choline supplements to the feed industry, recorded sales of $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, increasing 30.9% over sales of the prior year comparable quarter, driven by increased sales volume in liquid and dry choline as well as other derivative products. BCP Ingredients earned approximately $0.10 million compared to $0.08 million earned in the prior year quarter. Sales of the Encapsulated/ Nutritional Products segment declined approximately $0.1 million to $6.1 million, a decline of 1.8% from the $6.2 million of sales in the prior year comparable quarter, while the earnings declined $1.3 million from a $0.6 million profit in the fourth quarter of 2002 to a loss of $0.7 million in the current period. The Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment continues to be challenged. Customers and prospects have postponed marketing launches of new products in the U.S. food market. In addition, increased competition in both the Domestic and International food markets during the quarter continue to result in lower volumes sold and lower average selling prices which contributed to the erosion in profit margins for this segment. We saw sales of the Reashure product by our Animal Nutrition and Health group begin to move up with the improved state of the dairy economy. As noted in an earlier press release, the Company has responded to market conditions by making several organizational changes. These changes were effected late in the fourth quarter in an effort to refocus our commercial efforts, reduce operating expenses and improve the overall financial performance of this segment. Consolidated gross profit in the quarter ended December 31, 2003 declined $0.1 million, or 1.8%, over the comparable prior year due largely to the decline in sales volume and lower margin product mix in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment as noted above. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $3.3 million in the quarter, or 19.9% of net sales, as compared to 19.2% of net sales in the prior year quarter. Our balance sheet ratios and cash flow continued to be strong in the quarter. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, the Company reduced long term debt, as scheduled, by $1.7 million from $9.5 million to $7.8 million. As previously noted, we continued to reduce inventory levels, ending the year at $6.0 million. Our cash balance closed at $9.2 million, an increase of $7.5 million for the year.
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) Page 3 Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2004, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "Strength in the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segments should continue. Our Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment sees signs of some volume improvement in the domestic food sector and a rebounding dairy economy. This segment should improve in early 2004 compared to the first six months of 2003. With the recent organizational changes, we expect to see improved market focus and intend to continue our efforts to exploit our technology in each business segment. We now expect modest consolidated earnings growth for the early part of 2004 compared to 2003, with more significant growth later in the year coinciding with continued improvement in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be conducted on Thursday, February 12, 2004, at 2:00 PM ET to review fourth quarter 2003 results. Dino A. Rossi, Balchem's President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, Chief Financial Officer, will host the call.

April 27, 2004 BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) ------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the Quarter ended March 31, 2004 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) For the Three Months Ended March 31, ------------------------------------ 2004 2003 ---- ---- Net sales $15,644 $14,816 Gross profit 5,613 5,651 Operating expenses 2,685 2,894 ------- ------- Earnings from operations 2,928 2,757 Other expense 27 73 ------- ------- Earnings before income tax expense 2,901 2,684 Income tax expense 1,085 1,001 ------- ------- Net earnings $ 1,816 $ 1,683 ======= ======= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.37 $ 0.35 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.36 $ 0.34 Net sales achieved a record high level for the quarter ending March 31, 2004 at $15.6 million, an increase of 5.6%, as compared to $14.8 million reported for the comparable period last year. Net earnings also set a record for the first quarter at $1.8 million, up 7.9% as compared with the same period last year. Fully diluted earnings per share increased 5.9% to $0.36 for the first quarter of 2004 as compared to $0.34 for the comparable quarter of the prior year. For the first quarter of 2004, the ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of approximately $2.6 million on record first quarter sales of $7.0 million. Net sales were 18.4% higher than the prior year comparable quarter and earnings from operations were 25.8% higher, driven by increased sales volume of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and sales of single use ethylene oxide canisters for sterilization use in medical facilities. The BCP Ingredients segment recorded sales of approximately $3.0 million, increasing 8.6% over sales of the prior year comparable quarter, with strong sales volume in dry and aqueous choline products for poultry and swine. BCP Ingredients earned approximately $0.27 million compared to $0.16 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $5.6 million, a decline of 8.1% from the $6.1 million reported in the prior year comparable quarter. Earnings from operations were $0.1 million in the current quarterly period as compared to $0.6 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This segment returned to profitability following the two immediately preceding quarterly losses.
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) Page 2 The Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment continues to be challenged; however, sales grew both sequentially and over the prior year quarter in a number of our key product lines. Our feed stable Reashure product and our newly launched Nitroshure product are showing growing market acceptance in the face of the improving U.S. dairy economy. We also saw our domestic food and nutrient sales increase over the prior year first quarter and remain stable on a sequential basis. We have responded to competitive challenges with newly engineered products that have effectively solved prospect and customer problems while meeting the food industry's increasing demand for lower priced solutions. These actions tend to generate lower gross margins than realized in this segment historically, but are intended to broaden our technology and customer acceptance. Consolidated gross profit in the quarter ended March 31, 2004 was relatively flat with the prior year at $5.6 million. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were approximately $2.7 million in the quarter, a decline of $0.2M, equal to 17.2% of net sales, as compared to $2.9 million or 19.5% of net sales in the prior year comparable quarter. This decline is a result of the Company having made several organizational and business model changes affecting the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment. Many of these changes were effected late in the fourth quarter of 2003 in an effort to refocus our commercial efforts, reduce operating expenses and improve the overall financial performance of this segment. Our balance sheet ratios and cash flow continued to be strong in the quarter. During the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the Company reduced long term debt, as scheduled, by $0.4 million from $7.8 million to $7.4 million. Our cash and investments balance closed the quarter at $12.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million over the year end balance of $9.2 million and approximately $10.9 million over the previous year March 31 level. Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2004, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "Strength in the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segments should continue. Our Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment is seeing signs of volume improvement in the domestic food and animal nutrition sectors in the rebounding food and dairy economies. We continue to see erratic purchasing patterns by some of our international food and human choline customers; however, this segment should improve through 2004. With the organizational changes in our Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment, we expect to see improved market focus. We intend to continue our efforts to exploit our technology in each business segment. Based on the foregoing, we expect modest consolidated sales and earnings growth for the year 2004, with more significant growth later in the year coinciding with expected improvement in the markets served by the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be conducted on Tuesday, April 27, 2004, at 2:00 PM ET to review first quarter 2004 results. Dino A. Rossi, Balchem's President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, Chief Financial Officer, will host the call.

Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) Page 2 Net sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004 were a record $16.4 million, an increase of 10.7%, as compared to $14.9 million for the comparable prior year period. Net earnings for the second quarter were $2.0 million, an increase of 18.3% as compared with the same period last year. This resulted in a diluted net earnings increase of 14.4% to $0.39 per share for the second quarter of 2004 versus $0.34 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year. In this second quarter of 2004, all three segments of the company reported improved sales and earnings as follows. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of approximately $2.5 million on record second quarter sales of $7.1 million. Net sales were 11.5% higher than the prior year comparable quarter and earnings from operations were 5.1% higher, driven by increased sales volume of packaged ethylene oxide and sales of single use ethylene oxide canisters for use in medical device sterilization. The BCP Ingredients segment recorded sales of approximately $3.0 million, increasing 8.9% over the prior year comparable quarter, with continued strong sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 42.3% to approximately $0.20 million as compared to $0.14 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $6.4 million in the period, an increase of 10.7% from the prior year comparable quarter, principally due to improvements in the domestic and international food markets as well as increasing dairy industry acceptance of Nitroshure, which was launched in the first quarter of 2004. Earnings from operations for this segment improved to $0.47 million in the current quarterly period as compared to $0.23 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was $6.0 million compared to $5.5 million for the comparable year-ago period due to the above noted increase in sales volumes. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were approximately 17.2% of net sales, consistent with the first quarter results, improving from 18.3% of net sales in the prior year comparable quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, net sales increased 8.1% to $32.1 million compared to $29.7 million in the comparable prior year period, while net earnings increased 13.1% to $3.8 million or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $3.4 million, or $0.68 per diluted share in the prior year comparable period. Our balance sheet ratios and cash flow continue to be strong. During the quarter ended June 30, 2004, the Company reduced long term debt, as scheduled, by $0.4 million from $7.4 million to $7.0 million. Our cash balance closed the quarter at $13.6 million, an increase of $4.4 million over the year end balance of $9.2 million and approximately $11.1 million over the previous year's June 30 level. Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2004, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "Strength in the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segments should continue. Sales in our Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment, increased 12.9% sequentially from the quarter ending March 31, 2004 and we continue to see signs of volume improvement in the human food and nutrition market as well as animal nutrition. This segment should continue to improve through 2004. We have also added additional personnel talent to this segment in the marketing, sales and application R&D areas to improve our ability to serve our markets and exploit our technology. Based on the foregoing, we expect modest consolidated sales and earnings growth for the balance of 2004 over the first six months of this year, and double digit growth in earnings for the balance of 2004 over 2003 second half results.

Exhibit 10.3.1 BALCHEM CORPORATION STOCK OPTION GRANT This STOCK OPTION GRANT (the "Grant"), dated as of , is between ----- --------- BALCHEM CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (the "Corporation") and ----------- (the "Optionee"). - -------------------- -------- W I T N E S S E T H: 1. Grant of Options. Pursuant to the provisions of the 1999 Stock Plan of ---------------- the Corporation, as the same may be amended from time to time (the "Plan"), the Corporation has on the date set forth on Exhibit A hereto granted to Optionee, --------- subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and subject further to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the right and option to purchase from the Corporation the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation ("Stock") ----- set forth in Exhibit A at the price per share set forth in Exhibit A, as (i) --------- ---------- incentive stock options ("Incentive Options") under Section 422 of the Internal ------------------ Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and/or (ii) non-incentive stock ---- options ("Non-Qualified Options"), as set forth in Exhibit A (the Incentive ---------------------- --------- Options and Non-Qualified Options granted hereby being referred to together herein as the "Option" or the "Options"). Notwithstanding anything to the ------ ------- contrary contained in this Grant, the aggregate fair market value of Stock (determined as of the date of grant) with respect to which options intended as Incentive Options, whether granted to Optionee hereby or heretofore granted to Optionee by the Corporation, become exercisable for the first time in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. Accordingly, to the extent that the fair market value of the Stock subject to such options intended as Incentive Options exceeds that amount, the Options corresponding to such excess, whether or not referred to as or originally intended to be Incentive Options, shall nevertheless be for all purposes Non-Qualified Options. All determinations with respect to the foregoing shall be made in the order that the particular stock options in question were granted. This limitation is intended to acknowledge and comply with the annual vesting limitation on incentive stock option treatment contained in Section 422(d) of the Code and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 2. Terms and Conditions. The term of the Option shall be for the period --------------------- specified in Exhibit A. The Option shall be exercisable at any time in whole or --------- in part and from time to time subject to earlier termination as provided in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Grant, unless otherwise expressly provided in Exhibit ------- A. Unless otherwise provided in Exhibit A as to Non-Qualified Options, the - - --------- Option may not be exercised (a) as to fewer than 100 shares at any one time (or for the remaining shares then purchasable under the Option, if fewer than 100 shares), and (b) until fulfillment of any conditions precedent set forth in Paragraph 7 hereof. The holder of any Option shall not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to the Stock issuable upon exercise of an Option until certificates for such Stock shall have been issued and delivered to him after the exercise of the Option. 3. Termination of Employment. In the event that the employment (as defined ------------------------- in the Plan) of Optionee shall be terminated (otherwise than by reason of death, or disability or for cause, as defined below), the Option shall be exercisable (to the extent that Optionee shall have been entitled to do so at the termination of his employment) at any time prior to the expiration of the period of sixty (60) days after such termination, but in no event later than the specified expiration date, except as may be expressly provided in Exhibit A with --------- respect to Non-Qualified Options. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that the employment of Optionee shall be terminated for cause, all vested and unvested portions of the Option shall be immediately forfeited by Optionee without any consideration. For the purposes hereof, "cause" shall be defined as: any illegal or disreputable conduct which impairs ----- or is injurious to the reputation, goodwill or business of the Corporation or is seriously injurious to its stockholders, or involves the misappropriation of funds or property of the Corporation or any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries or any of the customers or vendors thereof or others having business relations with any of them. A termination for "cause" will include any resignation in anticipation of discharge for "cause" or accepted by the Corporation in lieu of a formal discharge for "cause." This Grant does not constitute an employment contract. Nothing in the Plan or in this Grant shall confer upon Optionee any right to be continued in the employ of the Corporation or its subsidiaries for the length of any vesting schedule or for any portion thereof or for any other period of time, or interfere in any way with the right of the Corporation or any such subsidiary to terminate or otherwise modify the terms of Optionee's employment; provided, that a change in Optionee's duties or position shall not affect Optionee's Option so long as Optionee is still an employee of the Corporation or any Related Company (as defined in the Plan). 4. Death or Disability of Optionee. ------------------------------- (a) Death. If Optionee ceases to be employed by the Corporation and all ----- Related Companies by reason of his death, any unexercised portion of the Option shall be exercisable (to the extent that Optionee shall have been entitled to do so at the time of his death), by his estate, personal representative or beneficiary who has acquired the Option by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, at any time prior to the earlier of the specified expiration date of the Option or 180 days from the date of Optionee's death, except as may be provided in Exhibit A with respect to Non-Qualified Options. --------- (b) Disability. If Optionee ceases to be employed by the Corporation and ---------- all Related Companies by reason of his disability, any unexercised portion of the Option shall be exercisable (to the extent that Optionee shall have been entitled to do so at the date of termination of his employment), to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which he could have exercised it on that date, at any time prior to the earlier of the specified expiration date of the Option or 180 days from the date of the termination of Optionee's employment, except as may be provided in Exhibit A with respect to Non-Qualified Options. --------- For the purposes of the Plan, the term "disability" shall mean "permanent and ---------- total disability" as defined in Section 22(e)(3) of the Code or successor statute. 5. Transferability of Option. Incentive Options shall not be transferable ------------------------- otherwise than by will or the law of descent and distribution and are
exercisable during the lifetime of Optionee only by Optionee. Non-Qualified Options shall not be transferable, except as, and then only to the extent, if any, provided in Exhibit A hereto. 6. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization. In the event of changes in ------------------------------------------- the outstanding stock of the Corporation by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations or exchanges of shares, separations, reorganizations or liquidations, the number and class of shares subject to the Option shall be correspondingly adjusted as provided in the Plan. 7. Conditions Precedent To Exercise of Option. In the event that the ----------------------------------------------- exercise of the Option or the issuance and delivery of the shares hereunder shall be subject to, or shall require, any prior exchange listing, prior approval of the stockholders of the Corporation, or other prior condition or act, pursuant to the applicable laws, regulations or policies of any stock exchange, federal or local government or its agencies or representatives, and/or pursuant to the Plan, then the Option shall not be deemed to be exercisable under this Grant until such condition is satisfied. The Corporation shall not be liable in any manner to Optionee or any other party for any failure or delay by the Corporation on its part to fulfill any such condition. 8. Methods of Exercising Option. Subject to the terms and conditions of ------------------------------ this Grant, the Option may be exercised by delivering a signed, completed exercise notice in the form of Exhibit B hereto, as the same may be modified --------- from time to time by determination of the Corporation in its discretion, to the Corporation, at its office at 52 Sunrise Park Road, P.O. Box 600, New Hampton, New York, 10958. Such notice shall (i) identify the Option to which it applies (i.e., Incentive Option and/or Non-Qualified Option), (ii) state the election to exercise the Option, (iii) designate the number of shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised, and (iv) be signed by the person or persons so exercising the Option, and shall otherwise be in such form and substance as the Corporation may require. Such notice shall be accompanied by payment of the full purchase price of such shares. The Corporation shall deliver to Optionee, at such address as is provided in the notice, a certificate or certificates representing such shares as soon as practicable after the notice shall be received and all conditions to the exercise of the Option are fulfilled and satisfied. Payment of such purchase price shall be made (a) in United States dollars in cash or by check, or (b) through delivery of shares of Stock theretofore owned by Optionee for at least six months and having a fair market value equal as of the date of the exercise to the cash exercise price of the Option, or (c) by any combination of the above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Optionee may not pay any part of the exercise price hereof by transferring Stock to the Corporation if such Stock is both subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code. The certificate or certificates for the shares as to which the Option shall have been so exercised shall be issued in the name of the person or person so exercising the Option (or, if the Option shall be exercised by Optionee and if Optionee shall so request in the notice exercising the Option, the certificate shall be issued in the name of Optionee and another person jointly, with right of survivorship) and shall be delivered as provided above to or upon the written order of the person or persons exercising the Option. In the event the Option shall be exercised, pursuant to Paragraph 4 hereof, by any person or persons other than Optionee, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option. At the election of the Corporation, such certificate may bear such legends regarding the limited
transferability of the shares under applicable securities laws the Corporation may require. All shares that shall be purchased upon the exercise of the Option as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable. 9. Certain Securities Law Matters. By acceptance of the Option, Optionee ------------------------------- agrees that a purchase of shares under the Option will not be made with a view to their distribution, as that term is used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), unless in the opinion of the Corporation such distribution is in compliance with or exempt from the registration and prospectus requirements of the Act, and Optionee agrees to sign a certificate to such effect at the time of exercising the Option (which certificate shall, if required by the Corporation, be in such form and substance, and pertaining to such securities law related matters, as the Corporation may require in its discretion), and agrees that the certificate for the shares so purchased may, if deemed appropriate by the Corporation, be inscribed with a legend to ensure compliance with the Act. Optionee agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein and the requirements of the Act, the Corporation may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent. The Corporation shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any shares purchased upon the exercise of the Option that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Grant and/or the Plan, or (ii) to treat as owner of such shares or to accord the right to vote or receive dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such shares shall have been so sold or transferred. 10. Capital Changes and Business Successions. The Plan contains provisions ---------------------------------------- covering the treatment of the Option in a number of contingencies such as stock splits and mergers. Provisions in the Plan for adjustment with respect to stock subject to options and the related provisions with respect to successors to the business of the Corporation are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference. In general, Optionee should not assume that the Option necessarily would survive the acquisition of the Corporation. 11. Early Disposition. Optionee agrees to notify the Corporation in writing ----------------- immediately after Optionee makes a Disqualifying Disposition of the Stock received pursuant to the exercise of any of the Incentive Options. A "Disqualifying Disposition" is any disposition (including any sale) of such -------------------------- Stock before the later of (a) two years after the date Optionee was granted the ----- Option or (b) one year after the date Optionee acquired Stock by exercising the Option. If Optionee has died before such Stock is sold, these holding period requirements do not apply and no Disqualifying Disposition can occur thereafter. Optionee also agrees to provide the Corporation with any information which it shall request concerning any such disposition. Optionee acknowledges that he or she will forfeit the favorable income tax treatment otherwise available with respect to the exercise of any of the Incentive Options, if he or she makes a Disqualifying Disposition of the Stock received upon exercise of the Option. 12. Withholding Taxes. Upon the exercise of a Non-Qualified Option, the ------------------ making of a Disqualifying Disposition, the exercise of an Option transferred by the original Optionee in accordance with the terms of this Grant or the Plan, or the vesting of restricted Stock acquired on the exercise of the Option under the Plan, the Corporation may require Optionee or the purchaser or original Optionee to pay to the Corporation in cash an amount equal to all applicable withholding
taxes in respect of the amount that is considered compensation includable in such person's gross income. The Corporation in its discretion may condition (i) the exercise of the Option, (ii) the vesting of restricted Stock acquired by exercising the Option, or (iii) the exercise of a transferred Option, on Optionee's payment of such amount. At the Corporation's discretion, the amount required to be withheld may be withheld in cash from such wages, or (with respect to compensation income attributable to the exercise of the Option) in kind from the Stock otherwise deliverable to Optionee on exercise of the Option. Optionee further agrees that, if the Corporation does not withhold an amount from Optionee's wages sufficient to satisfy the Corporation's withholding obligation, Optionee will reimburse the Corporation on demand, in cash, for the amount underwithheld. 13. Fair Market Value of Stock. If, at the time the Option is granted under -------------------------- the Plan, the Corporation's Stock is publicly traded, "fair market value" shall ----------------- be determined as of the last business day for which the prices or quotes discussed in this sentence are available prior to the date such Option is granted and shall mean (i) the average (on that date) of the high and low prices of the Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which the Stock is traded, if the Stock is then traded on a national securities exchange; or (ii) the last reported sale price (on that date) of the Stock on the NASDAQ National Market List, if the Stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange and is reported on the NASDAQ National Market List; or (iii) the average of the closing bid and asked prices last quoted (on that date) by an established quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if the Stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange and is not then reported on the NASDAQ National Market List. However, if the Stock is not publicly traded at the time the Option is granted under the Plan, "fair market value" shall be deemed to be the fair value of the Stock as determined by the Corporation's Board of Directors or any Compensation Committee thereof (the "Committee"), after taking --------- into consideration all factors which it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the Stock in private transactions negotiated at arm's length, if any. The determination by the Board of Directors or the Committee of fair market value shall be conclusive and binding. The fair market value of the Stock in question shall be determined as of the day on which the event occurs. 14. Terms of Plan Control. The Option granted hereunder is granted pursuant --------------------- to the provisions of the Plan, the receipt of a copy of which Optionee hereby acknowledges.

Terms and Conditions. The term of the Option shall be for the period --------------------- specified in Exhibit A. The Option shall be exercisable at any time in whole or --------- in part and from time to time subject to earlier termination as provided in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Agreement. The holder of any Option shall not have any rights as a stockholder with respect to the stock issuable upon exercise of an Option until certificates for such Stock shall have been issued and delivered to him after the exercise of the Option. 3. Termination as a Director. In the event that Optionee shall cease to be ------------------------- a director, or, if Optionee is a director emeritus of the Corporation, Optionee shall cease to be a director emeritus, of the Corporation (otherwise than by reason of death or disability), the Option shall be exercisable (to the extent that Optionee shall have been entitled to do so at the time of said cessation) at any time prior to such cessation, but in no event later than the specified expiration date of the Option. Nothing in the Plan or in this Agreement shall confer upon Optionee any right to be continued as a director or as a director emeritus of the Corporation for the term of the Option or for any portion thereof or for any other period of time, or interfere in any way with the right of the stockholders and/or the directors of the Corporation to replace or remove Optionee as a director or a director emeritus of the Corporation, with or without cause, in accordance with the Corporation's By-laws and applicable law.
4. Death or Disability of Optionee. -------------------------------- (a) Death. If Optionee ceases to be a director or director emeritus of the ----- Corporation by reason of his death, any unexercised portion of the Option shall be exercisable (to the extent that Optionee shall have been entitled to do so at the time of his death), to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which he could have exercised it on that date, by his estate, personal representative or beneficiary who has acquired the Option by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, at any time prior to the earlier of the specified expiration date of the Option or 90 days from the date of Optionee's death. (b) Disability. If Optionee resigns, or otherwise ceases to be a director ---------- or director emeritus by the Corporation by reason of his disability, any unexercised portion of the Option shall be exercisable (to the extent that Optionee shall have been entitled to do so at the date of termination of his membership on the Board), to the extent of the number of shares with respect to which he could have exercised it on that date, at any time prior to the earlier of the specified expiration date of the Option or 90 days from the date of resignation or cessation. For all purposes of this Agreement, the term "disability" shall mean "permanent and total disability" as defined in Section ---------- 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") or successor statute. ---- 5. Transferability of Option. The Option shall not be transferable, except ------------------------- as, and then only to the extent, provided in Exhibit A hereto. --------- 6. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization. In the event of changes in ------------------------------------------- the outstanding stock of the Corporation by reason of stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations or exchanges of shares, separations, reorganizations or liquidations, the number and class of shares subject to the Option shall be correspondingly adjusted as provided in the Plan. 7. Conditions Precedent To Exercise of Option. In the event that the ----------------------------------------------- exercise of the Option or the issuance and delivery of the shares hereunder shall be subject to, or shall require, any prior exchange listing, prior approval of the stockholders of the Corporation, or other prior condition or act, pursuant to the applicable laws, regulations or policies of any stock exchange, federal or local government or its agencies or representatives, and/or pursuant to the Plan, then the Option shall not be deemed to be exercisable under this Agreement until such condition is satisfied. The Corporation shall not be liable in any manner to Optionee or any other party for any failure or delay by the Corporation on its part to fulfill any such condition.
8. Methods of Exercising Option. Subject to the terms and conditions of ------------------------------ this Agreement, the Option may be exercised by delivering a signed, completed exercise notice in the form of Exhibit B hereto, as the same may be modified ---------------- from time to time by determination of the Corporation in its discretion, to the Corporation, at its office at P.O. Box 175, Slate Hill, New York, 10973. Such notice shall (i) identify the Option to which it applies (i.e., Incentive Option and/or Non-Qualified Option), (ii) state the election to exercise the Option, (iii) designate the number of shares in respect of which the Option is being exercised, and (iv) be signed by the person or persons so exercising the Option, and shall otherwise be in such form and substance as the Corporation may require. Such notice shall be accompanied by payment of the full purchase price of such shares. The Corporation shall deliver to Optionee, at such address as is provided in the notice, a certificate or certificates representing such Stock as soon as practicable after the notice shall be received and all conditions to the exercise of the Option are fulfilled and satisfied. Payment of such purchase price shall be made (a) in United States dollars in cash or by check, or (b) through delivery of shares of Stock theretofore owned by Optionee for at least six months and having a fair market value equal as of the date of the exercise to the cash exercise price of the Option, or (c), in the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") (that is, --------- only in the event of the express prior approval thereof by the Committee), by delivery (including by telecopier) to the Corporation or its designated agent of an executed irrevocable exercise notice together with irrevocable instructions to a broker-dealer to sell (or margin) a sufficient portion of the shares and deliver the sale (or margin loan) proceeds directly to the Corporation to pay for the exercise price, or (d) by any combination of the above if permitted hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Optionee may not pay any part of the exercise price hereof by transferring Stock to the Corporation if such Stock is both subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and not transferable within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code. The certificate or certificates for the shares as to which the Option shall have been so exercised shall be issued in the name of the person or person so exercising the Option (or, if the Option shall be exercised by Optionee and if Optionee shall so request in the notice exercising the Option, the certificate shall be issued in the name of Optionee and another person jointly, with right of survivorship) and shall be delivered as provided above to or upon the written order of the person or persons exercising the Option. In the event the Option shall be exercised, pursuant to Paragraph 4 hereof, by any person or persons other than Optionee, such notice shall be accompanied by appropriate proof of the right of such person or persons to exercise the Option. At the election of the Corporation, such certificate may bear such legends regarding the limited transferability of the shares under applicable securities laws the Corporation may require. All shares that shall be purchased upon the exercise of the Option as provided herein shall be fully paid and non-assessable.
9. Certain Securities Law Matters. By acceptance of the Option, Optionee ------------------------------- agrees that a purchase of shares under the Option will not be made with a view to their distribution, as that term is used in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), unless in the opinion of the Corporation such distribution is in compliance with or exempt from the registration and prospectus requirements of the Act, and Optionee agrees to sign a certificate to such effect at the time of exercising the Option (which certificate shall, if required by the Corporation, be in such form and substance, and pertaining to such securities law related matters, as the Corporation may require in its discretion), and agrees that the certificate for the shares so purchased may, if deemed appropriate by the Corporation, be inscribed with a legend to ensure compliance with the Act. Optionee agrees that, in order to ensure compliance with the restrictions referred to herein and the requirements of the Act, the Corporation may issue appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent. The Corporation shall not be required (i) to transfer on its books any shares purchased upon the exercise of the Option that have been sold or otherwise transferred in violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement and/or the Plan, or (ii) to treat as owner of such shares or to accord the right to vote or receive dividends to any purchaser or other transferee to whom such shares shall have been so sold or transferred. 10. Capital Changes and Business Successions. The Plan contains provisions ---------------------------------------- covering the treatment of the Option in a number of contingencies such as stock splits and mergers. Provisions in the Plan for adjustment with respect to stock subject to options and the related provisions with respect to successors to the business of the Corporation are hereby made applicable hereunder and are incorporated herein by reference. In general, Optionee should not assume that the Option necessarily would survive the acquisition of the Corporation. 11. Withholding Taxes. Upon the exercise of a Non-Qualified Option, the ------------------ exercise of an Option transferred by the original Optionee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the Plan, or the vesting of restricted Common Stock acquired on the exercise of the Option, the Corporation may require Optionee or the purchaser or original Optionee to pay to the Corporation in cash an amount equal to all applicable withholding taxes in respect of the amount that is considered compensation includable in such person's gross income. The Corporation in its discretion may condition (i) the exercise of the Option, (ii) the vesting of restricted Common Stock acquired by exercising the Option, or (iii) the exercise of a transferred Option, on Optionee's payment of such amount. At the Corporation's discretion, the amount required to be withheld may be withheld in cash from fees and/or other compensation payable to Optionee, or (with respect to compensation income attributable to the exercise of the Option) in kind from the Stock otherwise deliverable to Optionee upon exercise of the Option. Optionee further agrees that, if the Corporation does not withhold an amount from Optionee's fees or other compensation sufficient to satisfy the Corporation's withholding obligation, Optionee will reimburse the Corporation on demand, in cash, for the amount underwithheld.
12. Fair Market Value of Stock. If, at the time the Option is granted under -------------------------- the Plan, the Corporation's Stock is publicly traded, "fair market value" shall ----------------- be determined as of the last business day for which the prices or quotes discussed in this sentence are available prior to the date such Option is granted and shall mean (i) the average (on that date) of the high and low prices of the Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which the Stock is traded, if the Stock is then traded on a national securities exchange; or (ii) the last reported sale price (on that date) of the Stock on the NASDAQ National Market List, if the Stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange and is reported on the NASDAQ National Market List; or (iii) the average of the closing bid and asked prices last quoted (on that date) by an established quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if the Stock is not then traded on a national securities exchange and is not then reported on the NASDAQ National Market List. However, if the Stock is not publicly traded at the time the Option is granted under the Plan, "fair market value" shall be deemed to be the fair value of the Stock as determined by the Corporation's Board of Directors or any Committee, after taking into consideration all factors which it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the Stock in private transactions negotiated at arm's length, if any. The determination by the Board of Directors or the Committee of fair market value shall be conclusive and binding. The fair market value of the shares in question shall be determined as of the day on which the event occurs. 13. Terms of Plan Control. The Option granted hereunder is granted pursuant --------------------- to the provisions of the Plan, the receipt of a copy of which Optionee hereby acknowledges. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall in any way be deemed to alter or modify the provisions of the Plan and no act of the Corporation or its directors, officers or employees shall be deemed to be a waiver or modification of any provision of the Plan. The provisions of the Plan shall in all respects govern the Option. The Committee shall have authority in its discretion, but subject to the express provisions of the Plan, to interpret the Plan and this Agreement; to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan and the Option; and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan or the Option. The Committee's determination on the foregoing matters shall be conclusive. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized officer and Optionee has executed this Agreement as of the date first written above.

Rossi, President, Chief Executive Officer Dated: October 26, 2004 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated October 26, 2004, reporting its financial results for the third quarter of 2004.

October 26, 2004 BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) ------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the Quarter ended September 30, 2004 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) For the Three Months Ended September 30, ---------------------------------------- 2004 2003 ---- ---- Net sales $17,356 $15,791 Gross profit 6,219 4,657 Operating expenses 2,789 3,260 ------- ------- Earnings from operations 3,430 1,397 Other expense 39 62 ------- ------- Earnings before income tax expense 3,391 1,335 Income tax expense 1,231 468 ------- ------- Net earnings $ 2,160 $ 867 ======= ======= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.43 $ 0.18 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.42 $ 0.17 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, --------------------------------------- 2004 2003 ---- ---- Net sales $49,449 $45,467 Gross profit 17,855 15,796 Operating expenses 8,308 8,879 ------- ------- Earnings from operations 9,547 6,917 Other expense 88 206 ------- ------- Earnings before income tax expense 9,459 6,711 Income tax expense 3,482 2,470 ------- ------- Net earnings $ 5,977 $ 4,241 ======= ======= Basic net earnings per common share $ 1.20 $ 0.88 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 1.17 $ 0.85
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) Page 2 Record net sales were achieved for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 of $17.4 million. This is an increase of 9.9%, as compared to $15.8 million for the comparable prior year period and marks the first time the company has surpassed sales of $17 million in a quarter. Net earnings for the third quarter were $2.2 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 149% as compared with the same period last year. This is largely due to the fact that we continued to operate the Encapsulated/Nutritional Product segment profitably, reflecting our designed turn-around, versus the loss incurred in the prior year comparable quarter. This resulted in a diluted net earnings increase of 141.3% to $0.42 per share for the third quarter of 2004 versus $0.17 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year. In this third quarter of 2004, all three segments of the company reported improved sales and earnings versus the prior year comparable period. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of approximately $2.7 million on record quarterly sales of $7.2 million. Net sales were 7.3% higher than the prior year comparable quarter and earnings from operations were 17.6% higher, driven by increased sales volume of packaged ethylene oxide and sales of single use ethylene oxide canisters for use in medical device sterilization. The BCP Ingredients segment realized record quarterly sales of approximately $3.7 million, increasing 19.9% over the prior year comparable quarter, with continued strong sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. Earnings from operations for this sector improved to approximately $0.39 million as compared to $0.17 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $6.5 million in the period, an increase of 7.7% from the prior year comparable quarter, principally due to improvements in the domestic and international food markets as well as sales in the most recent quarter of Nitroshure, which is being sold into the animal health industry. Earnings from operations for the encap segment were $0.34 million in the current quarterly period as compared to a $1.07 million loss in the prior year comparable quarter. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 was $6.2 million, an increase of 33.5%, compared to $4.7 million for the comparable year period due to the above noted increase in sales and improvements in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Product business operating result. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $2.8 million, approximately 16.0% of net sales, improving from 20.6% of net sales in the prior year comparable quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, net sales have increased 8.8% to $49.4 million compared to $45.5 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 40.9% to $6.0 million or $1.17 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $4.2 million, or $0.85 per diluted share in the prior year comparable period. Our balance sheet ratios and cash flow continued to be strong. During the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company reduced long term debt, as scheduled, by $0.5 million from $7.0 million to $6.5 million. Our cash balance closed the quarter at $17.3 million, an increase of $8.1 million over the year end balance of $9.2 million and approximately $12.7 million over the previous year's September 30 level.
Balchem Corporation (AMEX: BCP) Page 3 Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2004, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "Strength in the ARC Specialty Products and BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segments should continue. Our Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment quarterly sales increased 2.0% sequentially, as we continue to see signs of volume improvement, albeit fluctuating, in the human food and nutrition market. We have responded to food marketplace economic pressures by re-engineering products to enable us to reduce price and, in some instances, lowered average selling prices. We are now also beginning to feel the impact of raw material increases that could squeeze our gross margins. Despite these issues, we do expect this segment to continue to improve through 2004. Animal nutrition sales have contributed nicely, as Reashure and Nitroshure sales growth is expected to continue. Based on the foregoing, we expect modest consolidated sales and earnings growth, over this third quarter result, to close out the balance of 2004. Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be conducted on Tuesday, October 26, 2004, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review third quarter 2004 results (for the period ending September 30, 2004).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Balchem Corporation Announces Stock Split and Increase in Cash Dividend New Hampton, New York. December 16, 2004: Ba1chem Corporation (Amex:BCP) today announced that its Board of Directors has voted to approve a 3-for-2 stock split, to be effected in the form of a stock dividend, and also a cash dividend of $0.09 per share. For purposes of the cash dividend, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock to which it will apply will give effect to the stock dividend. Both dividends will be payable on January 20, 2005 to stockholders of record as of December 30, 2004. Pursuant to the stock dividend, a stockholder will receive for each two shares of Balchem Common Stock held of record on December 30, 2004, one additional share of Common Stock. Stockholders will also receive $0.09 per share of Common Stock on a post stock split basis. Stockholders entitled to fractional shares resulting from the stock dividend will receive cash in lieu of such fractional shares based upon the closing price of Balchem's Common Stock on the record date. The stock split to be effected by means of the stock dividend will increase the number of Common Shares outstanding from approximately 5,079,010 to 7,619,010 shares. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, stated: "This Board action recognizes the company's strong financial performance and reflects the Board's continued confidence in the company's prospects, stemming from our core business as well as new initiatives underway. The cash dividend effectively represents a 69% increase over last year's dividend, when adjusted for the 3-for-2 stock split. We also expect that the resulting increase in our outstanding shares should improve trading liquidity and provide opportunities for broader ownership of our stock, and believe that these actions are in the best interests of Balchem and our stockholders."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On December 15, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Balchem Corporation ("Balchem") approved Balchem's Incentive Compensation Program for the 2005 calendar year (the "ICP). The ICP provides for the awarding of bonus compensation to executive officers and certain other employees , based upon the level of achievement of specific goals established for the particular officer or employee, and for the weighting of those goals to determine the amount of the bonus. No bonuses are required to be paid under the ICP unless a specified minimum level of consolidated net income before interest and taxes ("NIBIT") is achieved. The Compensation Committee has established such minimum level of NIBIT for 2005 based upon Balchem's estimated results of operations for the 2004 calendar year. Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement between Balchem and Dino A. Rossi, its President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Rossi is entitled to annual discretionary bonuses of up to 100% of his base salary, based upon Balchem achieving operating and/or financial targets established by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof. 50% of such bonus compensation is determined pursuant to the ICP. The Compensation Committee has established a minimum level of consolidated net income for the 2005 fiscal year to be achieved by Balchem in order for Mr. Rossi to be entitled to the portion of such bonus compensation not covered by the ICP.

SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. BALCHEM CORPORATION By:/s/ Dino A. Rossi ------------------------- Dino A. Rossi, President, Chief Executive Officer Dated: December 20, 2004
Exhibit Index ------------- Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- Exhibit 10.8 2005 Incentive Compensation Program

EXHIBIT 10.8 SUMMARY OF 2005 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION The Incentive Compensation Program (ICP) is a compensation and reward mechanism that shares with certain Balchem Corporation personnel, gains realized by the corporation as a result of successful effort, individually or as a member of the corporate team, beyond the basic tasks of their job responsibilities. These achievements are critical to the company's attainment of its corporate goals. The ICP also assists in communication and professional growth. To derive optimum benefits from the efforts, the person must be fully acquainted with corporate goals and the value system under which they have been created. Achievements that require the individual to exceed minimum, acceptable performance will result in sharpened job skills, enhanced creative thinking and a greater level of professional satisfaction. The ICP is, as its name implies, an incentive for certain employees to meet successfully specific objectives beneficial to the corporation. A safeguard requires that before an employee receives any bonus payments, the basic responsibilities of the job description must have been carried out satisfactorily. This ensures that normal operations will not be sacrificed, but maintained at desired levels. In order for any and all participants to be eligible to receive any portion of the ICP payout, the defined minimum Corporate NIBIT (Net Income Before Interest and Taxes) objective must be met. Failure of the Company to reach the NIBIT objective will result in no payout of ICP's for that year under this program. BONUSABLE GOALS The process of establishing bonusable goals requires a well-defined annual business plan from which most goals can be measured. The annual business plan, approved by the Board of Directors, evolves from the Corporate Strategic Plan that can also be the basis for some goals. o Identification with corporate goals o Identification of key objectives o A minimum NIBIT will be established annually which must be achieved in order for any portion of bonus to be paid. The Board of Directors reserves the right to approve a bonus payment, even when the Corporate NIBIT objective is not met, for individuals that achieved extraordinary performance in any given year. DETERMINE RELATIVE VALUE OF GOALS A. The goal must be a stretch, beyond job responsibilities and the person's overall job performance must be rated at least as "meets expectations" level. Page 1 of 3
B. Placing value on specific goal will be arrived at by: o To what degree will the objective help Balchem meet its stated goal for the year? o What is the relative degree of difficulty required to achieve the goal, i.e., creativity, involvement or negotiation with others, problem solving and other indices? o The intrinsic value of the goal: magnitude of income enhancement or cost savings? C. Typical number of ICP goals: Each employee will normally have from 4 to 6 bonusable goals. BONUSABLE RANGE: ICP may be implemented in a range of 10-50% of an eligible employee's current salary. A 10% of salary bonus target will be established as a minimum for those employees entering the ICP for the first time. Lower acceptable level and upper attainable levels are to be established for each goal wherever possible: The lower limit is to be the level that would be the equivalent of excellent effort to achieve the goal in its entirety, but not total achievement. o Achieving the lower limit results in receiving 70% of the 100% bonus for that goal. The upper level is the maximum that can be reasonably expected. o Attainment of the upper level or more will result in receiving 130% of the 100% bonus for that goal. Attainment of a goal between the lower limit and upper level may result in a bonus in proportion to the deviation from the 100% level for that goal. In determining the extent of fulfillment, judgment may have to be used when deciding the appropriate award level when hard accounting numbers are not available. When there is unclear distinction between levels of fulfillment, the following questions can be used to help make the final determination: o Were there advantages/benefits to the company above and beyond that which the business plan projected? o Were there extenuating or unanticipated circumstances or events that either benefited or hindered the accomplishment of results? ICP Eligible Personnel and levels of compensation are reviewed and approved annually by the Corporation Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Page 2 of 3
Weighting Guidelines: A. Approximately 20-30% of the bonus will be tied to corporate goals. B. Approximately 40% of the bonus will be based upon how successfully the division or group contributes to corporate performance; i.e., sales & profits, new customers, new products, cost reductions, efficiencies, etc. C. Approximately 30-40% will be based upon individual objectives. A minimum NIBIT objective will be established annually. This minimum NIBIT - -------------------------------------------------------------------------- objective must be achieved in order for any portion of bonus to be paid. The - ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will redefine this goal annually based on prior year's performance and new annual plan. All participating personnel will receive annual merit performance evaluations that measure both job performance per the job description and accomplishment toward ICP goals that are directly linked to corporate plans. Thus, total compensation for eligible participants will be determined based upon both merit and ICP program goal achievement. Employees must receive an overall annual evaluation of at least "Meets Expectations" to be eligible to participate in or receive any portion of a bonus. Page 3 of 3

Rossi, President, Chief Executive Officer Dated: February 15, 2005 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated February 15, 2005, reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2004.

BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) ------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the Quarter ended December 31, 2004 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) All per share information has been adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend declared on December 16, 2004 and paid on January 20, 2005. For the Three Months Ended December 31, --------------------------------------- 2004 2003 ---- ---- Net sales $ 17,957 $ 16,408 Gross profit 5,951 5,356 Operating expenses 2,701 3,258 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 3,250 2,098 Other (income) expense (6) 46 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 3,256 2,052 Income tax expense 1,207 654 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 2,049 $ 1,398 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.27 $ 0.19 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.26 $ 0.19 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, ---------------------------------------- 2004 2003 ---- ---- Net sales $ 67,406 $ 61,875 Gross profit 23,806 21,152 Operating expenses 11,009 12,137 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 12,797 9,015 Other expense 82 252 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 12,715 8,763 Income tax expense 4,689 3,125 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 8,026 $ 5,638 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 1.07 $ 0.78 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 1.03 $ 0.75
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) Page 2 Record net sales were achieved for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 of $18.0 million. This is an increase of 9.4%, as compared to $16.4 million for the comparable prior year period. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $2.0 million, an increase of $.7 million, or 46.6% as compared with the same period last year. This resulted in a diluted net earnings increase of 39.5% to $0.26 per share for the fourth quarter of 2004 versus $0.19 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year. In this fourth quarter of 2004, all three segments of the company reported improved sales and earnings versus the prior year comparable period. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of approximately $2.9 million on record quarterly sales of $7.5 million. Net sales were 4.1% higher than the prior year comparable quarter and earnings from operations were 8.7% higher, driven principally by increased sales volume of packaged ethylene oxide and sales of single use ethylene oxide canisters for use in medical device sterilization. The BCP Ingredients segment realized record quarterly sales of approximately $4.3 million, increasing 35.7% over the prior year comparable quarter, due principally to increased sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. Earnings from operations for this sector improved to approximately $0.26 million as compared to $0.10 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $6.2 million in the period, an increase of 2.2% from the prior year comparable quarter, principally due to improvements in the domestic food market as well as sales in the most recent quarter of Nitroshure, which is being sold into the animal health industry. Earnings from operations for the encap segment were $0.09 million in the current quarterly period as compared to a $0.67 million loss in the prior year comparable quarter which had included $0.4 million of re-organization charges. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 was $6.0 million, an increase of 11.1% compared to $5.4 million for the comparable year period, due to the above noted increase in sales. Although sales volumes and gross profit have increased during the quarter as compared to the comparable prior year period, our operating margins, in the three segments, were unfavorably impacted by rising raw material and energy costs. While we do not foresee near-term relief from these rising costs, we have initiated price increases to our various markets effective January 1, 2005 which should help to somewhat offset the noted cost increases. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $2.7 million, approximately 15.0% of net sales, improving from 19.9% of net sales in the prior year comparable quarter, which had included the previously noted re-organization charges. For the year ended December 31, 2004, net sales have increased 8.9% to a record $67.4 million compared to $61.9 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 42.4% to a record $8.0 million or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $5.6 million, or $0.75 per diluted share in the prior year comparable period. In addition, our balance sheet ratios and cash flow continued to strengthen. During the quarter ended December 31, 2004, the Company pre-paid $7.8 million, the remaining balance of its term loan. Our cash balance closed the quarter at $12.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million over the previous year's December 31 level, reflecting the noted prepayment of the term loan.
Balchem Corporation (AMEX: BCP) Page 3 Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2005, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "Having closed-out a record year in sales and earnings, we believe Balchem is positioned, financially and strategically, to capitalize on growth opportunities. We expect modest double digit increases in sales and earnings from organic growth in the three segments. We will seek to continue to improve our operating cost structure with improved volumes and enhanced technology, easing the pressure of higher energy and raw material costs. We are cautiously optimistic that we will identify one or more new strategic alliance and/or acquisition opportunities that will compliment the organic growth expectations."

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On February 10, 2005, the Board of Directors of Balchem Corporation (the "Company") granted options to purchase shares of its Common Stock to the five non-management directors of the Company pursuant to the Company's 1999 Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the "Plan").

The principal office of the corporation in the State of Maryland shall be located at the 20th Floor, 10 Light Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202. Section 2. OTHER OFFICES. The corporation may have offices at such other places within or without the State of Maryland as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the business of the corporation may require. ARTICLE II MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS Section 1. PLACE. All meetings of shareholders shall be held at the principal office of the corporation, or at such other place within the United States as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting. Section 2. ANNUAL MEETING. The annual meeting of the shareholders shall be held on such day in June in each year as the Board of Directors may fix for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may come before the meeting. If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be a legal holiday, such meeting shall be held at the same time on the next succeeding business day. Section 3. SPECIAL MEETING. The president or Board of Directors may call special meetings of the shareholders during the interval between annual meetings. Special meetings of shareholders shall also be called by the secretary upon the written request of the holders of shares entitled to cast not less than 25% of all of the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of such meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on thereat. The secretary shall inform the shareholders making such request of the reasonably estimated cost of preparing and mailing such notice of the meeting, and upon payment to the corporation of such costs by the shareholders, the secretary shall give notice stating the purpose or purposes of the meeting to all shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting. No special meeting need be called upon the request of the holders of shares entitled to cast less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at such meeting, to consider any matter which is, in the opinion of the Board of Directors or of the Executive Committee, if there is one in being, substantially the same as a matter voted upon at any special meeting of the shareholders held during the preceding twelve months. Section 4. NOTICE. Not less than ten (10) nor more than ninety (90) days before the date of every shareholders meeting, the secretary shall give to each shareholder who may be entitled to vote at such meeting, and to each shareholder not entitled to vote who is entitled by
statute to notice, written or printed notice stating the time and place of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, or as otherwise may be required by statute, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called either by mail or by presenting it to him personally or by leaving it at his residence or usual place of business. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the shareholder at his post office address as it appears on the records of the corporation, with postage thereon prepaid. Section 5. SCOPE OF NOTICE. No business shall be transacted at any special meeting of shareholders except that specifically designated in the notice. Any business of the corporation may be transacted at the annual meeting without being specifically designated in the notice, except such business as is required by statute to be stated in such notice. Section 6. QUORUM. At any meeting of shareholders the presence in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes thereat shall constitute a quorum; but this section shall not affect any statutory or charter requirement for the vote necessary for the adoption of any measure. If, however, such quorum shall not be present at any such meeting of shareholders, the shareholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until such quorum shall be present. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall been present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The shareholders present at a meeting which has been duly called and convened may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. Section 7. VOTING. A majority of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders duly called and at which a quorum is present, shall be sufficient to take or authorize action upon any matter which may properly come before the meeting, unless another method or number of votes is required by statute or by the charter of the corporation. Unless otherwise provided in these By-Laws or in the charter of the corporation, each outstanding voting share shall be entitled to one vote upon each matter submitted to vote at a meeting of shareholders. Section 8. PROXIES. At all meetings of shareholders a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the secretary of the corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Section 9. VOTING OF SHARES BY CERTAIN HOLDERS. Shares standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or foreign, when entitled to be voted, may be voted by the president or vice president or by proxy appointed by the president or a vice president of such other corporation, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote such shares pursuant to a by-law or a resolution of the Board of Directors of such other corporation presents a certified copy of such by-law or resolution, in which case such person may vote such shares. Any fiduciary may vote shares standing in his name as such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy.
Shares of its own stock belonging to this corporation shall not be voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time, but shares of its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity may be voted by a committee consisting of all the directors of the corporation who shall vote all the shares in proportion to the vote of the directors, except in an election of directors, when all such shares shall be divided into an equal number of parts, which number of parts shall correspond to the number of directors being elected, and a part shall be voted for each director proposed by immediate past management, and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time. Section 10. INSPECTORS. At any meeting of shareholders the chairman of the meeting may, or upon request of any shareholder shall, appoint one or more persons as inspectors for such meeting. Such inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of shares represented at the meeting, based upon their determination of the validity and effect of proxies, count all votes and report the results and do such other acts as are proper to conduct the election and voting with impartiality and fairness to all the shareholders. Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or by a majority of them if there be more than one inspector acting at such meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall be prima facie evidence thereof. Section 11. INFORMAL ACTION BY SHAREHOLDERS. Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting forth the action to be taken shall be signed by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof.

Section 4. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by or at the request of the president or by a majority of the directors then in office.

Personally delivered or telegram notices shall be given at least two (2) days prior to the meeting. Notice by mail shall be given at least five (5) days prior the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail properly addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. If notice be given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual, regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice, unless specifically required by statute.

If required by the Board of Directors, any officer or other party shall give the corporation a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as shall be satisfactory to the Board of Directors for the faithful performance of his duties and for the restoration to the corporation, in case of his death, resignation, retirement or removal from his office or other position, all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in his possession or under his control belonging to the corporation. ARTICLE VI CONTRACTS, LOANS, CHECKS AND DEPOSITS Section 1. CONTRACTS.

ARTICLE VII SHARES OF STOCK Section 1. CERTIFICATES OF STOCK. Each shareholder shall be entitled to a certificate or certificates which shall represent and certify the number and kind and class of shares owed by him in the corporation. Each certificate shall be signed by the president or a vice president and countersigned by the secretary or an assistant secretary or the treasurer or an assistant treasurer and shall be sealed with the corporate seal. The signatures may be either manual or facsimile. Certificates shall be consecutively numbered; and if the corporation shall, from time to time, issue several classes of stock, each class may have its own number series. In case any officer who has signed any certificate ceases to be an officer of the corporation before the certificate is issued, the certificate may nevertheless be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if the officer had not ceased to be such officer as to the date of its issue.

The corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Maryland. Section 3. LOST CERTIFICATE. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the corporation alleged to have been stolen, lost or destroyed upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be stolen, lost or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion, and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such stolen, lost or destroyed certificate or his legal representative to advertise the same in such manner as it shall require and/or to give bond, with sufficient surety, to the corporation to indemnify it against any loss or claim which may arise by reason of the issuance of a new certificate. Section 4. CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS OR FIXING OF RECORD DATE. The Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a date as the record date for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, any meeting of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of any rights, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose. Such date, in any
case, shall be not more than ninety (90) days, and in case of a meeting of shareholders not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which the meeting or particular action requiring such determination of shareholders is to be held or taken. In lieu of fixing a record date, the Board of Directors may provide that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a stated period but not to exceed, in any case, twenty (20) days. If the stock transfer books are closed for the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders, such books shall be closed for at least ten (10) days immediately preceding such meeting. If no record date is fixed and the stock transfer books are not closed for the determination of shareholders: (a) the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day on which the notice of meeting is mailed, or the thirtieth (30th) day before the meeting, whichever is the closer date to the meeting; (b) the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend or an allotment of any rights shall be at the closed of business on the day on which the resolution of the Board of Directors, declaring the dividend or allotment of rights, is adopted. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof, except where the determination has been made through the closing of the stock transfer books and the stated period of closing has expired. ARTICLE VIII FISCAL YEAR The Board of Directors shall have the power, from time to time, to fix the fiscal year of the corporation by a duly adopted resolution. ARTICLE IX DIVIDENDS Section 1. DECLARATION. Dividends upon the capital stock of the corporation, subject to the provisions, if any, of the charter of the corporation, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, pursuant to law. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation, subject to the provisions of law and of the charter. Section 2. CONTINGENCIES. Before payment of any dividends, there may be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Directors may from time to time, in its absolute discretion, think proper as a reserve fund to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board shall determine to be in the best interest of the corporation, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.
ARTICLE X SEAL The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the corporation, the year of its organization and the words, Incorporated Maryland.

In the event of settlement of such action, suit or proceeding in the absence of such adjudication, indemnification shall include reimbursement of amounts paid in settlement and expenses actually and necessarily incurred by such director or officer in connection therewith, but such indemnification shall be provided only if this corporation is advised by its counsel that in his opinion such settlement is for the best interests of this corporation and the director or officer to be indemnified has not been guilty of gross negligence or misconduct in respect of any matter covered by such settlement. Such right of indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right, or rights, to which such director or officer may be entitled under any agreement, vote of shareholders or otherwise. ARTICLE XII WAIVER OF NOTICE Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of these By-Laws or under the provisions of the charter of the corporation or under the provisions of the Maryland corporation law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of any meeting need be set forth in the waiver of notice, unless specifically required by statute. The attendance of any person at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the grounds that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. ARTICLE XIII AMENDMENT OF BY-LAWS Section 1. BY DIRECTORS. The Board of Directors shall have the power, at any annual or regular meeting, or at any special meeting, if notice thereof be included in the notice of such special meeting, to alter or repeal any By-Laws of the corporation and to make
new By-Laws, except that the Board of Directors shall not alter or repeal this section or any By-Laws made by the shareholders. Section 2. BY SHAREHOLDERS.

SIGNATURE Under the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the authorized undersigned. BALCHEM CORPORATION By:/s/ Dino A. Rossi ------------------------- Dino A. Rossi, President, Chief Executive Officer Dated: April 28, 2005 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated April 28, 2005, reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) Reported as follows (unaudited) for the Quarter ended March 31, 2005 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) All per share information has been adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend declared on December 16, 2004 and paid on January 20, 2005. For the Three Months Ended March 31, ------------------------------------ 2005 2004 ---- ---- Net sales $ 19,340 $ 15,644 Gross profit 7,182 5,613 Operating expenses 3,151 2,685 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 4,031 2,928 Other (income) expense (38) 27 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 4,069 2,901 Income tax expense 1,501 1,085 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 2,568 $ 1,816 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.34 $ 0.25 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.32 $ 0.24 New All Time Quarterly Records Were Achieved In Net Sales And Net Earnings. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Record net sales were achieved for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 of $19.3 million. This is an increase of 23.6%, as compared to $15.6 million for the comparable prior year period. Net earnings for the first quarter were a record $2.6 million, an increase of 41.4% as compared with the same period last year. This resulted in a diluted net earnings increase of 33.3% to $0.32 per share for the first quarter of 2005 versus $0.24 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year, again setting a new all time quarterly record. In this first quarter of 2005, all three segments of the company reported improved sales and earnings versus the prior year comparable period. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $7.8 million in the period, an increase of 38.9% from the prior year comparable quarter with particular strength in sales of food ingredients for the domestic and international markets, and for Reashure(TM) and Nitroshure(TM), our animal nutrition and health products targeted for dairy cows. Earnings from operations for the encap segment were $0.88 million in the current quarterly period as compared to a $0.08 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The BCP Ingredients segment realized record quarterly sales of approximately $4.4 million, increasing 47.0% over the prior year comparable quarter, due principally to increased sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. Earnings from operations for this segment doubled, improving to approximately $0.55 million as compared to $0.27 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of approximately $2.6 million on quarterly sales of $7.1 million. Net sales were 1.5% higher than the prior year comparable quarter due principally to increased revenues from sales of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization. These increased sales were partially offset by slowness in the ethylene oxide blends and EO canister product lines. Earnings from operations were 1.5% greater than the prior year comparable quarter for this segment.
Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 was $7.2 million, an increase of 27.9% compared to $5.6 million for the prior year comparable period, due to the above noted increase in sales. Sales volumes increased 26% from the levels in the comparable prior year quarter, driving improvements to gross margin levels, particularly in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products and BCP, Ingredients segments. Certain product gross margins were unfavorably impacted by rising raw material and energy costs however, the larger sales volumes helped to overcome this effect as we leveraged on our manufacturing capabilities. While we do not foresee near-term relief from these rising costs, price increases to various markets have helped to somewhat offset these noted cost increases. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $3.2 million, up $0.5 million from the comparable quarter last year, but equaling approximately 16.3% of net sales, improving from 17.2% of net sales in the prior year comparable quarter. Our balance sheet remained strong at quarter end reflecting total cash and investments of $16.1 million, no long-term debt and shareholder equity of $53.8 million. Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2005, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "Our Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment sees signs of volume improvement in the domestic food sector and a steady dairy economy which should result in continued improvement in sales of Reashure(TM) and Nitroshure(TM) over 2004 levels. Strength in BCP Ingredients Unencapsulated Feed Supplements segment should continue and we expect improved growth from the ARC Specialty Products segment. Overall, we continue to expect modest double digit increases in total sales and earnings from organic growth for the year. We will seek to continue to improve our operating cost structure through improved volumes and enhanced technology, in order to ease the pressure of higher energy and raw material costs. We are cautiously optimistic that we will identify one or more new strategic alliance and/or acquisition opportunities that will complement the organic growth expectations." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be conducted on Thursday, April 28, 2005 at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review first quarter 2005 results (for the period ending March 31, 2005).

ARTICLE 11 ---------- Indemnification and Survival ---------------------------- 11.1 Indemnification of Purchaser. Subject to Section 11.8 hereof, Seller ---------------------------- agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, shareholders, agents, employees, successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses, direct or indirect damages, fines, penalties or liabilities (including interest which may be imposed by a court in connection therewith), income taxes with respect to any indemnification payments hereunder, court costs, litigation expenses, reasonable attorneys' and paralegals' fees and accounting fees (collectively "Damages") ------- suffered, sustained or incurred by Purchaser or such other parties with respect to, arising from or in connection with, or alleged to result from, arise out of or in connection with: (a) a breach by Seller of any representation or warranty made or misrepresentation made by Seller in this Agreement and not waived by Purchaser in writing; 25
(b) a breach or non-performance by Seller of any covenant, restriction or agreement made by Seller in this Agreement and not waived by Purchaser in writing; or (c) any threatened or instituted Claim of any kind whatsoever, whether instituted or commenced prior to or after the Closing Date, to the extent that it relates to or arises from the Business or the Acquired Assets on or prior to the Closing Date. 11.2 Indemnification of Seller. Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and ------------------------- hold Seller and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, shareholders, agents, employees, successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered, sustained or incurred by Seller or such other parties with respect to, to the extent arising from or in connection with, or alleged to result from, arise out of or in connection with: (a) a breach by Purchaser of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement and not waived by Seller in writing; or (b) a breach or non-performance by Purchaser of any covenant, restriction or agreement made by Purchaser in this Agreement and not waived by Seller in writing; or (c) any threatened or instituted Claim of any kind whatsoever, which is instituted or commenced on or after the Closing Date, to the extent that it relates to or arises from Purchaser's ownership or operation of the Business or the Acquired Assets after the Closing Date, it being understood and agreed by Seller that this indemnification shall not be applicable with respect to any event, act, omission, occurrence or condition to the extent that it existed or commenced prior to the Closing Date and which continues or extends beyond the Closing Date. 11.3 Procedure for Indemnification. ----------------------------- (a) The party or parties which are entitled to be indemnified under this Article 11 (individually or collectively the "Indemnified Party") ------------------ shall promptly give notice to the indemnifying party after obtaining knowledge of any claim as to which recovery may be sought against the indemnifying party because of the indemnity in this Article 11. If such indemnity shall arise from the claim of a third party, the Indemnified Party shall permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of any such claim and any litigation resulting from such claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to indemnification hereunder shall not be affected by any failure of an Indemnified Party to give such notice or delay by the Indemnified Party in giving such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, the rights and remedies of the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of the failure to give, or delay in giving, such notice. Failure by an indemnifying party to notify an Indemnified Party of its election to defend any such claim or action by a third party within fifteen (15) Business Days after notice thereof shall have been given to the indemnifying party shall be deemed a waiver by the indemnifying party of its right to defend such claim or action. If the indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of any such claim, the Indemnified Party shall have no further right to indemnification hereunder with respect to claims consisting of its legal fees and expenses, so long as the indemnifying party is continuing to defend such claim in good 26
faith. With respect to any claim by a third party, upon the written request of the indemnifying party, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the indemnifying party all relevant information in the possession of the Indemnified Party that may be material to such claim. If the indemnifying party shall not undertake the defense of such claim, as provided herein, then the obligation of the Indemnified Party to furnish information, as aforesaid, shall cease. (b) If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of such claim or litigation resulting therefrom, the obligations of the indemnifying party hereunder as to such claim shall include taking all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or settlement of such claim or litigation and holding the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and all damages caused by or arising out of any settlement approved by the indemnifying party or any judgment in connection with such claim or litigation. The indemnifying party shall not, in the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, consent to entry of any judgment (other than a judgment of dismissal on the merits without costs) except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party or enter into any settlement (except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party) which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation. If the Indemnified Party elects to reject a settlement or compromise proposed by the indemnifying party, where the claim or cause of action can be resolved solely by the payment of monetary damages, the indemnifying party shall have no further obligation to defend the claim and the indemnifying party's indemnification liability to the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim shall be no more than the highest bona fide offer by the indemnifying party to settle or compromise any claim where the claimant states in writing that such offer of settlement or compromise is unconditionally acceptable to it but the settlement or compromise is prevented from occurring by any action or a withholding of consent or approval on the part of the Indemnified Party. (c) If the indemnifying party shall not assume the defense of any such claim by a third party or litigation resulting therefrom after receipt of notice from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may defend against such claim or litigation in such manner as it deems appropriate, and unless the indemnifying party shall deposit with the Indemnified Party a sum equivalent to the total amount deemed by such Indemnified Party's counsel to be reasonable, including such counsel's estimate of the fees and costs of defending the same, the Indemnified Party may settle such claim or litigation on such terms as it may reasonably deem appropriate and the indemnifying party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for the amount of such settlement and for all damage incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense against or settlement of such claim or litigation. (d) The indemnifying party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for the amount of any judgment rendered with respect to any claim by a third party in such litigation and for all damage incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense against such claim or litigation, whether or not resulting from, arising out of, or incurred with respect to, the act of a third party. 27

Except as is otherwise expressly provided for in this Section 11.4, representations and warranties of any party hereto set forth herein shall survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date.

Any representation and warranty of Purchaser which was known by Purchaser to be untrue when made shall survive the Closing without limitation. Any claim which either party makes against the other in writing prior to the expiration of the applicable cut-off period provided for in this Section 11.4 shall survive the expiration of such period and the party asserting the claim shall have the right to pursue the same in accordance with the applicable indemnification provisions provided for in this Agreement. 11.5 Interest Upon Damages. In addition to any amounts payable by any ----------------------- indemnifying party to the Indemnified Party pursuant to Article 11 hereof, such indemnifying party shall pay to the Indemnified Party interest upon each portion or component of the Damages paid to the Indemnified Party at the six month LIBOR Rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, calculated from the date such indemnifying party is obligated to make such payment through the date the Damages are paid in full. 11.6 Minimum Threshold; Maximum Liability. ------------------------------------ (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 11.1 or 11.2 above, Seller shall not be liable to Purchaser with respect to indemnities provided by them under Section 11.1 until such time as the aggregate Damages exceeds One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000); provided, however, that in the event the aggregate Damages shall exceed -------- ------- One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), then Seller shall be liable for all such Damages, including the first One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) of Damages. (b) Subject to Section 11.7 below, the maximum aggregate liability of Seller under Section 11.1 hereof shall be fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price (the "Cap"). --- 11.7 Exceptions to the Cap. The Cap shall not apply with respect to the ---------------------- breach by Seller of (i) any representation or warranty made by Seller herein that was known to be untrue when made, or (ii) the representations and warranties made by Seller pursuant to Section 4.1 {Organization}, 4.3 {Authorization}, 4.8 {Title}, or 4.21 {Brokers and Finders} hereof. 11.8 Exclusive Remedy. Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a ----------------- matter of law, including without limitation, claims under applicable state and federal securities laws and fraud claims, the remedies provided for in this Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto and shall preclude assertion by any such party of any other rights or the seeking of any other remedies (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) against another party hereto with respect to the any matter covered by the indemnification provisions contained in this Article 11; provided that nothing herein shall be -------- construed or interpreted as limiting or impairing 28

BALCHEM CORPORATION By:/s/ Dino A. Rossi ------------------------- Dino A. Rossi, President, Chief Executive Officer Dated: October 26, 2005 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated October 26, 2005, reporting its financial results for the third quarter of 2005.

Exhibit 99.1 BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) ------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) All per share information has been adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend declared on December 16, 2004 and paid on January 20, 2005. For the Three Months Ended September 30, ---------------------------------------- 2005 2004 ---- ---- Net sales $ 21,145 $ 17,356 Gross profit 7,649 6,219 Operating expenses 2,918 2,789 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 4,731 3,430 Other (income) expense (126) 39 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 4,857 3,391 Income tax expense 1,833 1,231 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 3,024 $ 2,160 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.39 $ 0.29 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.37 $ 0.28 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, --------------------------------------- 2005 2004 ---- ---- Net sales $ 59,969 $ 49,449 Gross profit 21,943 17,855 Operating expenses 8,902 8,308 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 13,041 9,547 Other (income) expense (231) 88 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 13,272 9,459 Income tax expense 4,950 3,482 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 8,322 $ 5,977 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 1.08 $ 0.80 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 1.04 $ 0.78
New All Time Quarterly Records In Net Sales And Net Earnings ------------------------------------------------------------ Net sales of $21.1 million and net earnings of $3.0 million set new quarterly records for the period ending September 30, 2005, and reflect increases of 21.8% and 40% respectively over the prior year comparable quarter. These strong results were achieved by continued growth in the core segments of Balchem combined with the recent acquisition of certain assets of Loders Croklaan. These results generated a diluted earnings per share increase of 32.1%, or $0.37 per share, for this third quarter of 2005 versus $0.28 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year, also setting a new all time quarterly record. In the third quarter of 2005, all three segments of the company reported improved sales and earnings. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of $2.8 million on third quarter sales of $7.4 million. Net sales were 2.5% higher than the prior year comparable quarter and earnings from operations were 5.5% higher, driven principally by increased sales volume of packaged ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The BCP Ingredients segment realized record sales of $5.3 million, increasing 43.7% over the prior year comparable quarter, with continued strong sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 142.3% to $0.94 million as compared to $0.39 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $8.5 million in the period, an increase of 30.7% from the prior year comparable quarter, including $1.8 million of sales from the Loders Croklaan acquisition noted above. The domestic food market in the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment was quite strong; however, this growth was offset partially by some slowness in the nutritional supplement area. Earnings from operations for this segment improved to $0.95 million in the current quarterly period as compared to $0.35 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 was $7.6 million, an increase of 23.0% compared to $6.2 million for the prior year comparable period, due largely to the above noted increase in sales. Gross profit, as a percentage of sales, improved to 36.2% from 35.8% due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and favorable product mix. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $2.9 million, as compared to $2.8 million for the prior year comparable quarter, declining to approximately 13.8% of net sales from 16.1% of net sales in the comparable quarter of the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, net sales have increased 21.3% to $60.0 million compared to $49.5 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 39.2% to $8.3 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $6.0 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Balance sheet ratios and cash flow continue to be strong. Our September 30, 2005 balance sheet reflects total net cash and investments of $10.7 million after recognition of the previously noted acquisition of certain assets of Loders Croklaan. The company has no long-term debt and shareholder equity increased to $60.1 million.
Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2005, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "We are very pleased with the overall growth of all segments of the business, and are especially pleased with the integration and the immediate accretive results of the select Loders Croklaan assets acquired. We are now being confronted with higher raw material costs due to the well publicized effects of natural gas and other petrochemical derivative products. We will continue to aggressively position ourselves with our supply chain providers to keep these costs as low as possible and introduce price increases with our customers prudently. However, new product introductions, volume improvements, continued manufacturing efficiencies and the ability to leverage off of our existing operating structure should help us to achieve comparable double-digit growth in the fourth quarter versus the prior year comparable quarter. We will continue to build on our enhanced technology capabilities in the food, pharmaceutical and nutritional markets, as well as seeking more strategic alliances, joint ventures or acquisitions for each of the segments to complement our growth objectives." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be conducted on Wednesday, October 26, 2005 at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review third quarter 2005 results (for the period ending September 30, 2005).

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On November 2, 2005, Balchem Corporation ("Balchem"), through its wholly owned subsidiary Balchem Minerals Corporation ("BCM"), entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement with Chelated Minerals Corporation ("CMC"), a privately held, Utah corporation, and its shareholders to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of CMC for a purchase price of $17,350,000 (the "Stock Purchase Agreement"). The purchase price is subject to adjustment based upon CMC's working capital as of the closing date. CMC is a global leader in nutrient delivery technology for the animal health industry through its proprietary chelation process. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains, among other things, representations and warranties of the parties, conditions to closing and other customary provisions. The representations and warranties from the shareholders set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement shall survive the closing of this transaction for a period of one year; however liability of the shareholders for breach of the representations and warranties shall be limited to $7,500,000. The parties have agreed to hold $800,000 of the purchase price in a cash escrow account for a period of one year after the closing to secure the selling shareholders' indemnification obligations and obligations with respect to the purchase price adjustment under the Stock Purchase Agreement. The parties anticipate closing the transaction during the fourth quarter of 2005. In connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement and as an inducement for Balchem to enter into the transaction, Balchem will enter into agreements with certain key shareholders of CMC under which such shareholders will agree not to compete with Balchem or BCM in the chelated materials animal nutrition industries for a period of ten years following the closing date.

Section 9.2 Indemnification by the Purchaser. Subject to the limits set --------------------------------- forth in this Article 9, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the Shareholders and each of the Shareholders' successors and assigns (the Shareholders and such persons are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Shareholder's Indemnified Persons"), harmless from and against any and all Losses that the Shareholders' Indemnified Persons may suffer, sustain, incur or become subject to arising out of or due to: (a) any inaccuracy of any representation of the Purchaser in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by or referred to in this Agreement, or any schedule or exhibit hereto or thereto, or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto; (b) the breach of any warranty of the Purchaser in this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by or referred to in this Agreement, or any schedule or exhibit hereto or 27
thereto, or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto; or (c) the nonfulfillment of any covenant, undertaking, agreement or other obligation of the Purchaser under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by or referred to in this Agreement, or any schedule or exhibit hereto or thereto, or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or thereto not otherwise waived by the Shareholders, including, without limitation, any failure by the Purchaser to pay all Purchaser Acquisition Expenses (as defined in Section 10.1) in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.1. Section 9.3 Survival of Representations, and Warranties; Deductible. The -------------------------------------------------------- representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and the parties' right to indemnity in accordance with this Article 9 shall survive the Closing Date and shall remain in full force and effect thereafter for a period of twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and shall be effective with respect to any inaccuracy therein or breach thereof, notice of which shall have been duly given within such 12 month period in accordance with Section 9.4 hereof, after which twelve (12) month period they shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. Except as provided in Section 9.5, anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither party shall be entitled to any recovery from the other party with respect to any inaccuracy or breach of such warranties or representations unless and until the amount of such Losses suffered, sustained or incurred by the asserting party, or to which such party becomes subject, by reason of such inaccuracy or breach, shall exceed $60,000 calculated on a cumulative basis. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the Shareholders or the Purchaser be liable to the other, in each case, in an aggregate amount in excess of $7,500,000 (the "Indemnity Cap"). As an illustration of the provisions of Sections 9.1 and 9.3, a Shareholder holding 10% of the Shares could not be liable to the Purchaser in an amount exceeding $750,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.3 to the contrary, the covenants of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive according to their respective terms. Section 9.4 Notice and Opportunity to Defend. If there occurs an event --------------------------------- which either party asserts is an indemnifiable event pursuant to Sections 9.1 or 9.2 hereof, the party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnitee") shall notify the party obligated to provide indemnification (the "Indemnitor") promptly. If such event involves (a) any claim, or (b) the commencement of any action or proceeding by a third person, the Indemnitee shall give the Indemnitor written notice of such claim or the commencement of such action or proceeding. Delay or failure to so notify the Indemnitor shall only relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder to the extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by reasons of such delay or failure. The Indemnitor shall have a period of fifteen (15) days (or such lesser period as circumstances may dictate, if the nature of the claim requires an earlier response) within which to notify the Indemnitee of its intention to assume responsibility for the defense or settlement of the claim or action, and shall have the right to compromise or defend, at its own expense and by counsel chosen by the Indemnitor and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, such matter, so long as (i) the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee of its intention to assume responsibility to do so within the prescribed period; (ii) the Indemnitor provides the Indemnitee with such assurances as may be reasonably required by the Indemnitee to assure that the Indemnitor has the financial resources to and will assume and be responsible for the liability at issue, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.5 hereof, (iii) the particular claim or cause of action involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief, (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect to, the 28
claim or action is not, in the good faith judgment of the Indemnitee, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests of the Indemnitee, and (v) the Indemnitor conducts the defense of the claim or action actively and diligently. If the Indemnitor does not respond within such period or rejects responsibility for such matter in whole or in part, or if any of the conditions set forth in the preceding sentence is not satisfied or becomes unsatisfied, the Indemnitee shall be free to defend or compromise such claim or action in any matter it may reasonably deem appropriate, without prejudice to any of its rights hereunder, and may pursue any and all remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee under applicable Law. The Indemnitee agrees, at the Indemnitor's cost and expense, to cooperate fully with the Indemnitor and its counsel in the defense against any such asserted liability. In any event, the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor shall have the right to participate at its own expense in the defense of such asserted liability, including any meetings, discussions, and negotiations with any adverse party. Any compromise of such asserted liability by the Indemnitor shall require the prior written consent of the Indemnitee and until such consent is obtained the Indemnitor shall continue the defense of such asserted liability. If, however, the Indemnitee refuses its consent to a bona fide offer of settlement which the Indemnitor wishes to accept that involves solely money damages (and no injunctive or other equitable relief) in an amount to be paid entirely by the Indemnitor without contribution by the Indemnitee and provides for an unconditional release of the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may continue to pursue such matter, free of any participation by the Indemnitor, at the sole expense of the Indemnitee. In such event, the obligation of the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee shall be equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of the offer of settlement which the Indemnitee refused to accept plus the costs and expenses of the Indemnitee prior to the date the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee of the offer of settlement, and (ii) the actual out-of-pocket amount the Indemnitee is obligated to pay as a result of the Indemnitee's continuing to pursue such matter. Section 9.5 Reduction for Insurance. The amount which an Indemnitor is ------------------------- required to pay to, for, or on behalf of an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article 9 shall be reduced (including, without limitation, retroactively) by any insurance proceeds actually recovered by or on behalf of the Indemnitee in reduction of the related indemnifiable loss (the "Indemnifiable Loss"). Amounts required to be paid, as so reduced, are hereinafter sometimes called an "Indemnity Payment". If an Indemnitee shall have received, or if an Indemnitor shall have paid on its behalf, an Indemnity Payment in respect of an Indemnifiable Loss and shall subsequently receive, directly or indirectly, insurance proceeds in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss, then such Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the Indemnitor the amount of such insurance proceeds, or, if less, the amount of the Indemnity Payment. The parties hereto agree that the foregoing shall not affect the subrogation rights of any insurance companies making payments hereunder. Section 9.5 Offset of Escrow. The Shareholders' indemnification ------------------ obligations under Section 9.1 and Section 9.3 shall be secured by $800,000 held pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. ARTICLE 10. MISCELLANEOUS. Section 10.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, -------- each of the parties hereto shall pay its own expenses and costs incurred or to be incurred by it in negotiating, closing and carrying out this Agreement.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. On November 7, 2005, Balchem Corporation ("Balchem"), entered into a license agreement (the "License Agreement") with Project Management and Development Co., Ltd. ("PMD"), a corporation organized under the laws of Great Britain. The License Agreement gives PMD the right to utilize Balchem's proprietary continuous manufacturing technology for the production of aqueous choline chloride (the "Balchem Technology") in connection with PMD's construction and operation of an aqueous choline chloride production facility at PMD's Al-JuBail, Saudi Arabia petrochemical facility, currently scheduled for completion in 2008. The License Agreement provides PMD with the exclusive right to use the Balchem Technology in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait and UAE, as well as the non-exclusive right to market, sell and use the products derived from the Balchem Technology on a world-wide basis. The License Agreement further provides that Balchem will be PMD's exclusive North American distributor for said products during the term of the agreement. The License Agreement terminates either 10 years from the start-up of the PMD's production facility or December 31, 2020, whichever is earlier. Pursuant to the License Agreement, PMD will pay Balchem a license fee of $1,400,000 and a fee of $840,000 for the delivery by Balchem of certain preliminary drawings, specifications, process design documents containing the Balchem Technology, and additional training. These fees are to be paid in installments upon achievement of certain performance milestones set forth in the License Agreement. Balchem will provide certain performance guarantees associated with the Balchem Technology. In the event that the PMD manufacturing facility, if properly designed and constructed, fails to attain said performance guarantees, liquidated damages may be assessed, but not exceeding 70% of the license fee. The foregoing description of the License Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the Process and Product License Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. Although the PMD's signature on the License Agreement is dated October 18, 2005, PMD did not communicate its acceptance of the agreement to Balchem or deliver the executed agreement to Balchem until November 7, 2005, and therefore it did not become a binding agreement until that date. On November 14, 2005, the Company issued a press release announcing the entry into the Process and Product License Agreement. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

This AGREEMENT shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England, excluding its conflict of laws provisions. 9.9 Dispute Resolution 9.9.1 Any dispute that may arise under or in relation to this AGREEMENT shall be determined by arbitration, unless agreement in writing has been reached between the PARTIES to the dispute sixty (60) days after formal written notice of dispute or disagreement has been given by one PARTY to the other PARTIES to the dispute. The PARTIES agree that service of any notices in reference to such arbitration at their addresses as given in this AGREEMENT shall be valid and sufficient. 9.9.2 The arbitration shall be conducted according to the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC Rules"), in London, or another mutually agreeable location.

PMD CHOLINE CHLORIDE PROJECT COMPREHENSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 9.9.5 Any decision rendered by the arbitral tribunal, including the arbitral award shall be treated in secrecy by the arbitral tribunal and the PARTIES. 9.9.6 Each PARTY shall bear its costs and expenses incurred with the arbitration, including solicitors' fees. The PARTIES shall also share equally the arbitrators' fees and expenses provided, however, that the arbitrators may provide for alternative allocation of such expenses to a PARTY. 9.9.7 If any dispute: 9.9.7.1 raises issues which are substantially the same as, or connected with, or touch upon, or concern issues raised in any dispute or difference arising out of or in connection with the EPC Contract or the tri-partite agreement referred to in Article 9.11 (a "Related Project Dispute"); or 9.9.7.2 arises out of, or touches upon, or concerns substantially the same facts as are the subject of a Related Project Dispute, then notwithstanding that arbitrators may have been agreed or appointed under this AGREEMENT (but subject to clause 9.8), PMD may, by written notice to BALCHEM, the EPC CONTRACTOR and the arbitrators who have already been agreed or appointed hereunder, require the reference of any such dispute to be referred to and finally settled by the arbitral tribunal appointed or to be appointed under the EPC Contract in respect of any such related dispute ("Joint Tribunal"). 9.9.8 The Joint Tribunal shall become the arbitral tribunal in respect of any dispute or difference between the PARTIES.

Pending such determination, the fees of the arbitrators whose authority has been revoked shall be paid in equal portions by the PARTIES. 9.9.11 It is not intended that this clause shall operate so as to deprive any PARTY to a dispute of anything which, apart from this clause, would be a valid claim or defence. Accordingly, all claims and defences which were originally made in the cancelled arbitration shall be deemed for all purposes to have been brought when made and not be affected in any way by the revocation of the authority of the arbitrators or the cancellation of the arbitration pursuant to Articles 9.7 and 9.9 so that the position of either PARTY to the dispute shall not thereby be prejudiced with respect to any rule of law, statute, regulation or contractual provision which imposes a time limit on the commencement of proceedings or the right to any remedy. 9.9.12 The Joint Tribunal in determining any dispute shall consider all evidence which it may think pertinent to that dispute which is filed or called by a PARTY to the arbitration proceedings. 9.9.13 Notwithstanding any reference to arbitration hereunder the PARTIES shall continue to perform their respective obligations under this AGREEMENT unless the PARTIES otherwise agree. 9.10 Export of Technical Data - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Page 31

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 20, 2005, the Board of Directors of Balchem Corporation ("Balchem") approved Balchem's Incentive Compensation Program for the 2006 calendar year (the "ICP). The ICP provides for the awarding of bonus compensation to executive officers and certain other employees, based upon the level of achievement of specific goals established for the particular officer or employee, and for the weighting of those goals to determine the amount of the bonus. No bonuses are required to be paid under the ICP unless a specified minimum level of consolidated net income before interest and taxes ("NIBIT") is achieved. The Compensation Committee has established such minimum level of NIBIT for 2006 based upon Balchem's estimated results of operations for the 2005 calendar year.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement between Balchem and Dino
A. Rossi, its President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Rossi is entitled to annual discretionary bonuses of up to 100% of his base salary, based upon Balchem achieving operating and/or financial targets established by the Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof. 50% of such bonus compensation is determined pursuant to the ICP. The Compensation Committee has established a minimum level of consolidated net income for the 2006 fiscal year to be achieved by Balchem in order for Mr. Rossi to be entitled to the portion of such bonus compensation not covered by the ICP.

EXHIBIT 10.8
 
SUMMARY OF
2006 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
 
The Incentive Compensation Program (ICP) is a compensation and reward mechanism that shares with certain Balchem Corporation personnel, gains realized by the corporation as a result of successful effort, individually or as a member of the corporate team, beyond the basic tasks of their job responsibilities. These achievements are critical to the company's attainment of its corporate goals.
 
The ICP also assists in communication and professional growth. To derive optimum benefits from the efforts, the person must be fully acquainted with corporate goals and the value system under which they have been created. Achievements that require the individual to exceed minimum, acceptable performance will result in sharpened job skills, enhanced creative thinking and a greater level of professional satisfaction.
 
The ICP is, as its name implies, an incentive for certain employees to meet successfully specific objectives beneficial to the corporation. A safeguard requires that before an employee receives any bonus payments, the basic responsibilities of the job description must have been carried out satisfactorily. This ensures that normal operations will not be sacrificed, but maintained at desired levels. In order for any and all participants to be eligible to receive any portion of the ICP payout, the defined minimum Corporate NIBIT (Net Income Before Interest and Taxes) objective must be met. Failure of the Company to reach the NIBIT objective will result in no payout of ICP's for that year under this program.
 
BONUSABLE GOALS
 
The process of establishing bonusable goals requires a well-defined annual business plan from which most goals can be measured. The annual business plan, approved by the Board of Directors, evolves from the Corporate Strategic Plan that can also be the basis for some goals.
 
 - 
Identification with corporate goals
 - 
Identification of key objectives
 - 
A minimum NIBIT will be established annually which must be achieved in order for any portion of bonus to be paid.
 
The Board of Directors reserves the right to approve a bonus payment, even when the Corporate NIBIT objective is not met, for individuals that achieved extraordinary performance in any given year.
 
DETERMINE RELATIVE VALUE OF GOALS
 
A. The goal must be a stretch, beyond job responsibilities and the person's overall job performance must be rated at least as "meets expectations" level.
 
B. Placing value on specific goal will be arrived at by:
 - 
To what degree will the objective help Balchem meet its stated goal for the year?
 
 - 
What is the relative degree of difficulty required to achieve the goal, i.e., creativity, involvement or negotiation with others, problem solving and other indices?
 
 - 
The intrinsic value of the goal: magnitude of income enhancement or cost savings?
 
C. Typical number of ICP goals: Each employee will normally have from 4 to 6 bonusable goals.
 
BONUSABLE RANGE:
 
ICP may be implemented in a range of 10-50% of an eligible employee's current salary.
 
A 10% of salary bonus target will be established as a minimum for those employees entering the ICP for the first time.
 
Lower acceptable level and upper attainable levels are to be established for each goal wherever possible:
 
The lower limit is to be the level that would be the equivalent of excellent effort to achieve the goal in its entirety, but not total achievement.
 
 - 
Achieving the lower limit results in receiving 70% of the 100% bonus for that goal.
 
The upper level is the maximum that can be reasonably expected.
 
 - 
Attainment of the upper level or more will result in receiving 130% of the 100% bonus for that goal.
 
Attainment of a goal between the lower limit and upper level may result in a bonus in proportion to the deviation from the 100% level for that goal.
 
In determining the extent of fulfillment, judgment may have to be used when deciding the appropriate award level when hard accounting numbers are not available. When there is unclear distinction between levels of fulfillment, the following questions can be used to help make the final determination:
 
 - 
Were there advantages/benefits to the company above and beyond that which the business plan projected?
 - 
Were there extenuating or unanticipated circumstances or events that either benefited or hindered the accomplishment of results?
 
ICP Eligible Personnel and levels of compensation are reviewed and approved annually by the Corporation Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
 
Weighting Guidelines:
 
A. Approximately 20-30% of the bonus will be tied to corporate goals.
 
 
 
 
B. Approximately 40% of the bonus will be based upon how successfully the division or group contributes to corporate performance; i.e., sales & profits, new customers, new products, cost reductions, efficiencies, etc.
 
C. Approximately 30-40% will be based upon individual objectives.
 
A minimum NIBIT objective will be established annually. This minimum NIBIT
 
objective must be achieved in order for any portion of bonus to be paid. The
 
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will redefine this goal annually based on prior year's performance and new annual plan.
 
All participating personnel will receive annual merit performance evaluations that measure both job performance per the job description and accomplishment toward ICP goals that are directly linked to corporate plans. Thus, total compensation for eligible participants will be determined based upon both merit and ICP program goal achievement.
 
Employees must receive an overall annual evaluation of at least "Meets Expectations" to be eligible to participate in or receive any portion of a bonus.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On December 29, 2005, the Board of Directors of Balchem Corporation (the "Company") authorized the Company to enter into Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements (the "Agreements") to purchase the Company's Common Stock with the five non-employee directors of the Company pursuant to the Company's 1999 Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the "Plan"). This Agreement replaces the Stock Option Plan that non-employee directors participated in in prior years.
 
Under the Agreements, each of Hoyt Ammidon, Jr., John Y. Televantos, Edward L. McMillan, Kenneth P. Mitchell and Elaine R. Wedral has the right, pursuant to the Plan, to purchase up to 3,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at the purchase price of $.06-2/3 per share. The purchased stock is subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company and to restrictions on transfer until it vests in accordance with the provisions of the Agreements. The purchased stock will vest in full seven years from the date of the Agreements, provided the purchaser is still a director of the Company on that date. The purchased stock will also vest in full prior to seven years upon: (1) the purchaser's retirement from the Company's Board of Directors at or after age 70; (2) the purchaser's death or major disability, (3) the purchaser's resignation from the Company's Board of Directors due to a conflict of interest or serious illness, and (4) a change of control of the Company (as defined in the Agreements). The purchased shares will not vest and the Company may repurchase all of the purchased shares at a purchase price of $.06-2/3 per share in the event of gross misconduct on the part of the purchaser in the performance of his or her duties as a director of the Company prior to vesting, as determined by majority vote of the Board of Directors. A pro rated amount of the purchased shares may be repurchased by the Company at a purchase price of $.06-2/3 per share in the event the purchaser ceases to be a director of the Company prior to vesting of the purchased shares for any reason other than gross misconduct.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreements is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.

No Transfer pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective, and the Company shall not be required to recognize any transferee of Shares hereunder as a stockholder of the Company, unless and until the conditions set forth in the preceding sentence have been met and the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement.
 
7.

            All certificates representing Shares owned by the Purchaser shall have affixed thereto a legend in substantially the following form, in addition to any other legends that may be required under federal or state securities laws or under the Shareholders Agreement:

- 5 -
 
 
 
9.            
Remedies
. (a)  The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the provisions of this Agreement will cause irreparable damage to the Company and that the Company will have no adequate remedy at law for such violation. Accordingly, the Purchaser agrees that the Company shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, specific performance or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any further violation of such provision or affirmatively compelling the Purchaser to carry out his or her obligations hereunder. Such right to equitable relief shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy the Company may have at law or in equity.
 
(b)           In the event that the Purchaser fails to deliver any certificates representing Shares required to be transferred to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Company may (i) elect to establish a segregated account in which the purchase price for such Shares shall be placed, such account to be turned over to the Purchaser upon delivery of the certificates representing such Shares together with appropriate instruments of transfer duly executed by the Purchaser, and (ii) immediately thereafter take such action as may be required to transfer record title to such Shares to itself. The Purchaser hereby grants the Company a power of attorney for effecting any transfer in accordance with the previous sentence, such power of attorney to be deemed coupled with an interest and irrevocable.
 
10.           
Section 83(b) Election
. Purchaser understands that under Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the difference between the purchase price paid for the Shares and their fair market value on the date any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such Shares lapse will be reported as ordinary income at that time. For this purpose, the term "forfeiture restrictions" includes the right of the Company to repurchase the Shares pursuant to its repurchase option under Section 5 of this Agreement. Purchaser understands that Purchaser may elect to be taxed at the time the Shares are acquired hereunder to the extent the fair market value of the Shares differs from the purchase price rather than when and as such Shares cease to be subject to such forfeiture restrictions, by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the I.R.S. within thirty (30) days after the date of purchase hereunder. If the fair market value of the Shares at the date of purchase equals the purchase price paid (and thus no tax is payable), the election must be made to avoid adverse tax consequences in the future. Purchaser understands that failure to make this filing within the thirty (30) day period will result in the recognition of ordinary income by the Purchaser (in the event the fair market value of the Shares increases after the date of purchase) as the forfeiture restrictions lapse. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS PURCHASER'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE COMPANY'S, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b). PURCHASER IS RELYING
SOLELY
ON PURCHASER'S ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO FILE AN 83(b) ELECTION. PURCHASER ALSO AGREES TO PROVIDE COMPANY WITH A COPY OF THE 83(b) ELECTION IF SO FILED.
11.           
Withholding
.       The Company shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to the Purchaser any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to any of the Shares issued hereunder.
 
 
- 6 -
 
 
 
12.           
Severability
. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law.
 
13.           
Waiver; Amendment
. No provision of this Agreement shall be waived or amended, either generally or in any particular instance, except in a writing signed by the Company and the Purchaser.
 
14.          
Binding Effect.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and the Purchaser and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors and assigns. No transfer of any of the Shares shall be effective unless the transferee first agrees in writing to all of the terms hereof.
 
15.           
No Rights To Employment
. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Purchaser any right to be retained, in any position, as an employee of or consultant or advisor to the Company.
 
16.           
Notices
. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and deemed effectively given upon personal delivery, delivery by Federal Express or other recognized overnight delivery service or upon deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, if to the Company at its executive offices and if to the Purchaser at the address shown beneath his or her signature to this Agreement, or in either case at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section.
 
17.           
Pronouns.
Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.
 
18.          
Entire Agreement
. This Agreement and the documents and agreements referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
 
19.          
Governing Law
. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Company and each of the Purchasers hereby (a) agree that any action, suit or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of the State of New York or any federal court located in such state, and (b) irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of any such action, suit or proceeding.
 
20.           
1999 Stock Plan
. The Shares are issued pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Plan, a copy of which has been furnished to the Purchaser, and are subject to such Plan in all respects.

21.            
Section 409A Compliance
. This Stock Purchase Right is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, and the regulations issued thereunder. To the extent of any inconsistencies with the requirements of Section 409A, the Stock Purchase Right shall be interpreted and amended in order to meet such Section 409A requirements.

BALCHEM CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation having an address of P. O. Box 600, 52 Sunrise Park Road, New Hampton, New York 10958 (herein called the Company), hereby promises to pay to the order of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (successor by merger to Fleet National Bank) a national banking association having an office at 69 State Street, Albany, New York 12201 (the Bank or the Holder), or its successors or assigns, the principal sum of TEN MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($10,000,000.00), with interest thereon as set forth below.
SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF TERMS. The following words and terms as used in this Note shall have the following meanings unless the context or use indicates another or different meaning or intent:
Adjusted Libor Rate - Means a rate per annum subject to adjustment approximately each one month, two months, three months or six months, as applicable equal to the Libor Rate plus one percent (1.00%).
Business Day - In respect of any date that is specified in this Note to be subject to adjustment in accordance with applicable Following Business Day Convention, a day which commercial banks settle payment in London if the payment obligation is calculated by reference to any Libor Rate.
Default Rate - A per annum rate to two percent (2%) above the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Note.
Election Notice - The Libor Interest Rate Period notice to be delivered by the Company to the Bank from time to time in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto, in which the Company shall irrevocably indicate a Libor Interest Rate Period.
Event of Default - Any of those events defined as an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement.
Following Business Day Convention - The convention for adjusting any relevant date if it would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day. The term Business Day when used in conjunction with the term Following Business Day Convention and a date, shall mean that an adjustment will be made if that date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day so that the date will be the first following day that is a Business Day.
Libor Interest Rate Period - The one month, two month or three month, as applicable, (or slightly longer or shorter) period during which the Adjusted Libor Rate is in effect provided, however, that in no event shall any Interest Rate Election Period extend beyond the Maturity Date of this Loan.
Libor Rate - Means, the interest rate determined by the following formula (all amounts in the calculation will be determined by the Bank as of the first day of the Libor Interest Rate Period):
Loan - - The loan of $10,000,000.00 by the Lender to the Company that is the subject of this Note.
Loan Agreement - Means the amended and restated loan agreement dated the date hereof by and between the Company and the Bank, as such may be further amended or supplemented from time to time.
London Inter-Bank Offered Rate Means, for any applicable Libor Interest Rate Period, the rate per annum equal to the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate (BBA LIBOR), as published by Reuters (or other commercially available source providing quotations of BBA LIBOR as selected by the Bank from time to time) at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time two (2) London Banking Days before the commencement of the applicable Libor Rate Interest Period, for U.S. Dollar deposits (for delivery on the first day of such interest period) with a term equivalent to such Libor Rate Interest Period. If such rate is not available at such time for any reason, then the rate for that Libor Rate Interest Period will be determined by such alternate method as reasonably selected by the Bank. A "London Banking Day" is a day on which banks in London are open for business and dealing in offshore dollars.
Maturity Date - March 1, 2009.
Prime Rate - Means the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by the Bank as its Prime Rate. The Prime Rate is set by the Bank based on various factors, including the Banks costs and desired return, general economic conditions and other factors, and is used as a reference point for pricing some loans. The Bank may price loans to its customers at, above, or below the Prime Rate. Any change in the Prime Rate shall take effect at the opening of business on the day specified in the public announcement of a change in the Banks Prime Rate.
Reserve Percentage - Means the total of the maximum reserve percentages for determining the reserves to be maintained by member banks of the Federal Reserve System for Eurocurrency Liabilities, as defined in the Federal Reserve Board Regulation D, rounded upward to the nearest 1/100 of one percent. The percentage will be expressed as a decimal, and will include, but not be limited to, marginal, emergency, supplemental, special and other reserve percentages.
All other capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Loan Agreement (as hereinafter defined).
SECTION 2. INTEREST; PAYMENTS. (A) Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Note, commencing on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter up to and including the Maturity Date, interest (calculated on the Principal Balance hereof and based upon the actual number of days elapsed over a 360 day year) shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Libor Rate and shall be payable monthly as set forth in Section 2(B) hereof. In the event the Principal Balance remains outstanding after the Maturity Date, interest (calculated on the Principal Balance hereof and based upon the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year) shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.
(B)
  
   
Commencing April 1, 2006 and continuing on the first calendar day of each calendar month thereafter during the term hereof up to but not including the Maturity Date, monthly payments of accrued interest hereunder together with equal monthly payments of principal in an amount equal to $250,000.00 shall be due and owing.
(C)
 
 In the event that any portion of any payment due hereunder is not made within ten (10) days of the date such payment became due, the Company shall pay to the Holder on demand a late payment charge equal to five percent (5%) of the portion of any such payment not paid within such ten (10) day
   
2
period provided, however, that such late payment charge shall not exceed $10,000.00 in the aggregate per incident and shall not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate upon the maturity or acceleration of the Principal Balance.
(D)
  
   
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, on the Maturity Date, the entire outstanding principal amount hereof and all accumulated, accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable.
(E)
  
   
All payments received pursuant to this Note shall be applied first to the payment of all fees, expenses, and other amounts due to the Holder (excluding principal and interest), then to accrued, accumulated and unpaid interest, and the balance in reduction of the Principal Balance hereof, provided that should an Event of Default have occurred and be continuing, payments received hereunder shall be applied at the discretion of the Holder.
(F)
 
 All payments of interest and principal are to be made for the account of Bank of America, N.A., Peter D, Kiernan Plaza, Albany, New York 12207 or at such other place as the Holder may direct the Company by written notice. All payments shall be in lawful money of the United States in immediately available funds and are subject to the Following Business Day Convention with respect to date of payment.
   
SECTION 3. PREPAYMENT, MANDATORY REDEMPTION. (A) The Company may upon at least three (3) prior Business Days notice to the Holder (which notice shall be irrevocable) prepay the Principal Balance
, and any such prepayment shall occur only on the last day of the Libor Interest Rate Period. Each prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Portion, whether voluntary, by reason of acceleration or otherwise, will be accompanied by the amount of accrued interest on the amount prepaid and a prepayment fee as described below. A prepayment is a payment of an amount on a date earlier than the scheduled payment date for such amounts as required by this Note. The prepayment fee will be the sum of fees calculated separately for each Prepaid Installment, as follows:
(i)
  
   
The Bank will first determine the amount of interest which would have accrued each month for the Prepaid Installment had it remained outstanding until the applicable Original Payment Date, using the interest rate applicable to the Prepaid Installment under this Note.
(ii)
       
   
  
The Bank will then subtract from each monthly interest amount determined in (i) above, the amount of interest which would accrue for that Prepaid Installment if it were reinvested from the date of prepayment through the Original Payment Date, using the Treasury Rate.
(iii)  
   
If (i) minus (ii) for the Prepaid Installment is greater than zero, the Bank will discount the monthly differences to the date of prepayment by the Treasury Rate. The Bank will then add together all of the discounted monthly differences for the Prepaid Installment.
The following definitions will apply to the calculation of the prepayment fee:
(i)
        
   
  
Original Payment Dates mean the dates on which the prepaid principal would have been paid if there had been no prepayment. If any of the principal would have been paid later than the end of the fixed rate interest period in effect at the time of prepayment, then the Original Payment Date for that amount will be the last day of the interest period.
3
 
(ii)
 
   
 
Prepayment Installment means the amount of the prepaid principal which would have been paid on a single Original Payment Date.
 
(iii)
  
   
Treasury Rate means the interest rate yield for U.S. Government Treasury Securities which the Bank determines could be obtained by reinvesting a specified Prepaid Installment in such securities from the date of prepayment through the Original Payment Date. The Bank may adjust the Treasury Rate to reflect the compounding, accrual basis, or other costs of the prepaid amount. Each of the rates is the Banks estimate only and the Bank is under no obligation to actually reinvest any prepayment. The rates will be based on information from either the Telerate or Reuters information services,
The Wall Street Journal
, or other information sources the Bank deems appropriate.
If by reason of an Event of Default the Bank elects to declare this Note to be immediately due and payable, then any prepayment fee with respect to the resulting prepayment shall become due and payable in the same manner as though the Company had exercised a right of prepayment.
SECTION 4. LOAN AGREEMENT. The loan evidenced by this Note is being made pursuant to the terms, provisions and conditions of a certain amended and restated loan agreement dated the date hereof (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the Loan Agreement) by and between the Company and the Holder.
SECTION 5. DOCUMENTS. Reference is hereby made to the Loan Agreement and to all amendments and supplements thereto for the provisions, among others, with respect to the nature and extent of the rights, duties and obligations of the Company and the Holder and the terms upon which this Note is or may be secured.
SECTION 6. DEFAULT; ACCELERATION. The entire unpaid Principal Balance of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest due hereon, may be declared immediately due and payable by the Holder upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default as defined in the Loan Agreement provided, however, that from and after the date of any such declaration, the outstanding Principal Balance hereof and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable, interest shall continue to accrue on the unpaid Principal Balance to the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate.
SECTION 7. COVENANT AGAINST USURY. All agreements between the Company and the Holder are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Holder for the use or the forbearance of the indebtedness evidenced hereby exceed the maximum permissible under applicable law. As used herein, the term applicable law shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof provided, however that in the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then this Note shall be governed by such law as of its effective date. In this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is the intent of the Company and the Holder in the execution, delivery and acceptance of this Note to contract in strict compliance with the laws of the State of New York from time to time in effect. If, under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any law of the Financing Documents at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of such validity prescribed by applicable law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limits of such validity, and if under or from circumstances whatsoever the Holder should ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful
4
rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest. This provision shall control every other provision of all agreements between the Company and the Guarantors and the Holder.
SECTION 8. WAIVER OF DILIGENCE, PRESENTMENT, DEMAND, ETC. The Company hereby waives with respect to this Note: diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of bankruptcy of the Company or any other person or entity liable in respect to this Note, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or any other such Person; protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment of any such liabilities and any other notice and all demands whatsoever except as specifically set forth in this Note or any of the other Financing Documents.
SECTION 9. WAIVER, CHANGE, MODIFICATION OR DISCHARGE. The provisions of this Note may not be waived, changed, modified or discharged orally, but only by agreement in writing, signed by the party against whom any enforcement of any waiver, change, modification or discharge is sought.
SECTION 10. TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENT OF NOTE; PLEDGE OF RIGHTS; PARTICIPATION. (A) The Holder may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Note and the other Financing Documents to any of the twelve (12) Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341. No such pledge or enforcement thereof shall release the Holder from its obligations under any of the Financing Documents.
(B)
  
   
The Holder shall have the unrestricted right at any time and from time to time, to grant to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each, a Participant) participating interests in the Holders obligation to lend hereunder and/or any or all of the loans held by the Holder hereunder. In the event of any such grant by the Holder of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Company, the Holder shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder and the Company shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Holder in connection with the Holders rights and obligations hereunder.
The Holder shall have the unrestricted right at any time or from time to time, to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each, an Assignee), and the Company agrees that it shall execute, or cause to be executed, such documents, including without limitation, amendments to this Loan Agreement and to the other Financing Documents as the Holder shall deem necessary to effect the foregoing. In addition, at the request of the Holder and any such Assignee, the Company shall issue one or more new promissory notes, as applicable, to any such Assignee and, if the Holder has retained any of its rights and obligations hereunder following such assignment, to the Holder, which new promissory notes shall be issued in replacement of, but not in discharge of, the liability evidenced by the promissory note held by the Holder prior to such assignment and shall reflect the amount of the respective commitments and loans held by such Assignee and the Holder after giving effect to such assignment. Upon the execution and delivery of appropriate assignment documentation, amendments and any other documentation required by the Holder in connection with such assignment, and the payment by Assignee of the purchase price agreed to by the Holder, and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a party to this Loan Agreement and shall have all of the rights and obligations of the Holder hereunder and under the other Financing Documents to the extent that such rights and obligations have been assigned by the Holder pursuant hereto and to the assignment documentation between the Holder and such Assignee, and the Holder shall be released from its obligations hereunder and thereunder to a corresponding extent.
Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and except with respect to an assignment or transfer of the Loans mandated by a Governmental Authority, the Company shall have the
5
right to approve the identity of any Participant or Assignee pursuant to this subsection (B), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Except as aforesaid, the right of the Holder to assign or grant a participation interest shall not require notice to or consent of the Company.
The Holder may furnish any information concerning the Company in its possession from time to time to prospective Assignees and Participants, provided that the Holder shall require any such prospective Assignee or Participant to agree in writing for the benefit of the Company to maintain the confidentiality of such information.
SECTION 11. JURY TRIAL WAIVER. THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDER (BY ACCEPTANCE OF THIS NOTE) MUTUALLY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM BASED HEREON, ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS NOTE OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALINGS, STATEMENTS OR ACTIONS OF THE HOLDER RELATING TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LOAN OR ENFORCEMENT OF THIS NOTE, AND AGREE THAT NEITHER PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH ACTION WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE COMPANY HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO CLAIM OR RECOVER IN ANY LITIGATION ANY SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES OTHER THAN, OR IN ADDITION TO, ACTUAL DAMAGES. THE COMPANY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE HOLDER HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE HOLDER WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER. THIS WAIVER CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE HOLDER TO ACCEPT THIS NOTE AND MAKE THE LOAN.
SECTION 12. RIGHT OF SET OFF. The Company hereby grants to the Holder, a continuing lien, security interest and right of setoff as security for all liabilities and obligations to the Holder, whether now existing or hereafter arising, upon and against all deposits, credits, collateral and property, now or hereafter in the possession, custody, safekeeping or control of the Holder or any entity under the control of Bank of America Corporation and its successors and assigns, or in transit to any of them. At any time, without demand or notice (any such notice being expressly waived by the Company), the Holder may set off the same or any part thereof and apply the same to any liability or obligation of the Company even though unmatured and regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral securing this Note. ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE THE HOLDER TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THIS NOTE, PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY, ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVED.
SECTION 13. EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ENFORCEMENT. The Company shall pay on demand all reasonable expenses of the Holder in connection with the preparation, administration, default, collection, waiver or amendment of loan terms, or in connection with the Holders exercise, preservation or enforcement of any of its rights, remedies or options hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable fees of outside legal counsel or the allocated costs of in-house legal counsel, accounting, consulting, brokerage or other similar professional fees or expenses, and any reasonable fees or expenses associated with travel or other costs relating to any appraisals or examinations conducted in connection with the loan or any collateral therefor, and the amount of all such expenses shall, until paid, bear interest at the rate applicable to principal hereunder (including any default rate) and be an obligation secured by any collateral.

THE COMPANY AGREES THAT ANY SUIT FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS NOTE MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE GOVERNING STATE OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING THEREIN AND CONSENTS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT AND SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH SUIT BEING MADE UPON THE COMPANY BY MAIL AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN.

ADVANCES
. Advances under this Note shall be reflected on the records of the Payee. In absence of an Event of Default by the Company, as the Company makes repayments of principal, it shall be permitted to re-borrow hereunder until the Maturity Date. When requesting each advance of Loan proceeds from the Bank, the Company shall deliver to the Bank an Election Notice setting forth the Loan Portion, and indicating a Libor Interest Rate Period for such Loan Portion. The Interest Rate Election for each Loan Portion shall remain in effect until expiration of the Libor Interest Rate Period for that Loan Portion. Prior to the end of the Libor Interest Rate Period at issue, the Company shall deliver to the Bank a new Election Notice designating the new Libor Interest Rate Period to apply to the Loan Portion. In the event the Company fails to deliver an Election Notice to the Bank prior to the expiration of any Libor Interest Rate Period, the current Libor Interest Rate Period then in effect interest shall apply to that Loan Portion until the Company again designates a Libor Interest Rate Period. Once chosen, the Loan Portion and the Libor Interest Rate Period shall remain in effect until the expiration of the Libor Interest Rate Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, (i) there shall be no more than three (3) Loan Portions outstanding at any one time bearing interest at the Adjusted Libor Rate (ii) the Companys ability to elect to have the Adjusted Libor Rate apply to the Loan or a Loan Portion shall be conditioned upon the absence of an Event of Default that is then continuing and (iii) Bank shall not be obligated to honor an Election Notice in the event either (x) dollar deposits in the principal amount requested, and for the periods equal to the applicable Libor Interest Rate Period selected, are not available in the London inter-bank market or (y) the Libor Rate does not accurately reflect the cost of said requested principal amount, in which event the interest rate shall be determined by the Bank based upon a comparable Prime Rate based rate of interest until such time as said conditions no longer exist.
PAYMENTS
. In the event the entire amount of any payment due hereunder is not paid within ten (10) days after the same is due a late fee equal to five percent (5%) of the required payment will be charged by the Payee provided, however,
that such late fee shall not exceed $10,000.00 in the aggregate per incident and shall not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate upon the maturity or acceleration of the Principal Balance.
Accrued interest shall be payable on the first day of the month immediately succeeding the date of this Note, and on the first day of each succeeding month thereafter during the term of this note and all disbursed unpaid principal together with accrued interest will be paid in full no later than the Maturity Date. All payments shall be applied first to the payment of all fees, expenses and other amounts due to the Payee (excluding principal and interest), then to accrued interest, and the balance on account of outstanding principal; provided, however that after the occurrence of an Event of Default, payments will be applied to the obligations of the Company to the Payee as the Payee determines in its sole discretion. All payments shall be in lawful money of the United States in immediately available funds, without counterclaim or set off and free and clear of and without any deduction or withholding for, any taxes or other payments, and are subject to the Following Business Day Convention with respect to date of payment.
PREPAYMENT
. The Company may prepay a Libor Advance only upon at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Bank (which notice shall be irrevocable), and any such prepayment shall occur only on the last day of the Libor Interest Rate Period. Each prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Portion, whether voluntary, by reason of acceleration or otherwise, will be accompanied by the amount of accrued interest on the amount prepaid and a prepayment fee as described below. A prepayment is a payment of an amount on a date earlier than the scheduled payment date for such amounts as required by this
3
Note. The prepayment fee will be the sum of fees calculated separately for each Prepaid Installment, as follows:
The following definitions will apply to the calculation of the prepayment fee:
If by reason of an Event of Default the Bank elects to declare this Note to be immediately due and payable, then any prepayment fee with respect to the resulting prepayment shall become due and payable in the same manner as though the Company had exercised a right of prepayment.
LETTERS OF CREDIT
. All commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit issued hereunder shall be issued pursuant to the standard documentation provided by the Bank and shall be subject to the payment of an annual fee equal to one percent (1.00%) of the face amount of all standby letters of credit and one quarter of one percent (.25%) of the face amount of all commercial letters of credit, so issued and outstanding, such fee to be due and payable in advance in quarterly installments on the first day of each calendar quarter based upon the total outstanding commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit hereunder as of January 1 of each year. Any outstanding commercial letters of credit issued
4
pursuant to the terms hereof shall expire no later than 180 days following the Maturity Date and any outstanding stand by letter of credit issued pursuant to the terms hereof shall expire no later than 360 days following the Maturity Date.
DEFAULT
. Upon the occurrence of one or more Events of Default under the Loan Agreement, the entire principal and interest on this Note shall become immediately due and payable without presentment or protest or other notice of demand, all of which are expressly waived by the Company. If the Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects not to demand payment by the Company, notwithstanding said failure to demand, the Bank shall be under no obligation to make advances pursuant to the terms of this Note unless and until the Event of Default is cured to the satisfaction of the Bank.
If an Event of Default should occur and be continuing or after the Maturity Date or after judgment has been rendered on this Note, all Loan Portions shall bear interest at the Default Rate until the earlier of (i) the Event of Default is cured, or (ii) all Loan Portions are paid in full.
The powers and remedies given hereby shall not be exclusive of any other powers and remedies available to the Payee. No course of dealings between the Company and the Payee and no delay on the part of the Payee in exercising any rights with respect to any default shall operate as a waiver of any rights of the Payee. Failure upon the part of the Payee to exercise any rights with respect to any default shall not operate as a waiver of any rights with respect to any other default.
Interest after maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) shall be payable at the Default Rate set forth herein until this Note is paid in full.
PARTIAL INVALIDITY
. If any provision of this Note or the application of it to any person or circumstance, shall be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Note or the application of that provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected and every other provision of this Note shall be valid and fully enforceable.
WAIVER, CHANGE, MODIFICATION OR DISCHARGE
. This Note may not be waived, changed, modified or discharged orally, but only by agreement in writing signed by the party against whom any enforcement of any waiver, change, modification or discharge is sought.
COVENANT AGAINST USURY
. All agreements between the Company and the Bank are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Bank for the use or the forbearance of the indebtedness evidenced hereby exceed the maximum permissible under applicable law. As used herein, the term applicable law shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof provided, however that in the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then this Note shall be governed by such law as of its effective date. In this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is the intent of the Company and the Bank in the execution, delivery and acceptance of this Note to contract in strict compliance with the laws of the State of New York from time to time in effect. If, under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of such validity prescribed by applicable law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limits of such validity, and if under or from circumstances whatsoever the Bank should ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest. This provision shall control every other provision of all agreements between the Company and the Bank.

. The Company hereby waives with respect to this Note: diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of bankruptcy of the Company or any other person or entity liable in respect to this Note, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or any other such person; protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment of any such liabilities and any other notice and all demands whatsoever except as specifically set forth in this Note.

Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and except with respect to an assignment or transfer of the Loans mandated by a Governmental Authority, the Company shall have the right to approve the identity of any Participant or Assignee under this subsection (B), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Except as aforesaid, the right of the Bank to assign or grant a participation interest shall not require notice to or consent of the Company.
The Bank may furnish any information concerning the Company in its possession from time to time to prospective Assignees and Participants, provided that the Bank shall require any such prospective Assignee or Participant to agree in writing for the benefit of the Company to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated February 17, 2006, reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2005.

Record net sales were achieved for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 of $23.1 million. This is an increase of 28.8%, as compared to $18.0 million for the comparable prior year. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $2.6 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 28.4% as compared with the same period last year. This resulted in an increase in diluted net earnings of 29.4% to $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of 2005 versus $0.17 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year.
In the fourth quarter of 2005, sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $9.4 million in the period, an increase of 50.3% from the prior year comparable quarter, including $1.5 million of sales from the Loders Croklaan acquisition. This growth was driven principally by strength in sales of food ingredients for the domestic and international markets, improved sales
 
of human choline products and continued strong sales of REASHURE our animal nutrition and health product targeted for dairy cows. Earnings from operations for this segment improved to $0.79 million in the current quarterly period as compared to $0.09 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of $2.6 million on fourth quarter sales of $7.3 million. Net sales were 1.4% lower than the prior year comparable quarter, principally a result of slowness in sales of ethylene oxide canisters, as our customers adjusted inventory levels down near year end. Earnings from operations for this segment were 9.3% lower than the prior year quarter, driven principally by higher raw material and energy costs. The BCP Ingredients segment realized record sales of $6.4 million, increasing 50.1% over the prior year comparable quarter, with continued strong sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 70.9% to $0.45 million as compared to $0.26 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Earnings from this segment were also unfavorably impacted by higher raw material and energy costs.
Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 was $6.7 million, an increase of 13.2% compared to $6.0 million for the prior year comparable period, due largely to the above noted increase in sales. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses were $2.9 million, as compared to $2.7 million for the prior year comparable quarter, declining to approximately 12.4% of net sales from 15.0% of net sales in the comparable quarter of the prior year, as we continue to leverage our sales growth with our current infrastructure.
We set new net sales and net earnings records for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, as net sales increased 23.3% to $83.1 million from $67.4 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings increased 36.5% to $11.0 million, or $.91 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $8.0 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period.
Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Our December 31, 2005 balance sheet reflects total net cash and investments of $13.0 million after recognition of the previously noted acquisition of certain assets of Loders Croklaan. In the quarter, we also bought back $1.1M of our stock, under our stock re-purchase program, due to low prices in the market. The company has no long-term debt and shareholder equity increased to $60.1 million.
 
 
 
Outlook
Commenting on 2005, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said We are very pleased with the overall growth of all segments of the business, and are especially pleased with the integration and the accretive results of the Loders Croklaan assets acquired. In the fourth quarter, we experienced unfavorable raw material cost increases that reduced our profitability by approximately $0.9M, largely due to the well publicized effect of increased natural gas and energy related costs. We continue to aggressively position ourselves with our supply chain providers to keep these costs as low as possible and have introduced price increases with our customers, effective January 1, 2006, to help defray these cost increases. New product introductions, volume improvements, continued manufacturing efficiencies and the ability to leverage off of our existing operating structure should help us achieve continuing double-digit growth in the upcoming year. We expect to build on our enhanced technology capabilities in the food, pharmaceutical, nutritional, and animal health markets, as well as seek out more strategic alliances, joint ventures or acquisitions for each of the segments to complement our growth objectives. To this point, one week ago, we closed the previously announced acquisition of Chelated Minerals Corporation (CMC). We are very pleased to add this new technology, product line and expanded customer base to our animal nutrition and health business. CMC had revenues of approximately $6.0 million in 2005, and we expect double digit growth in this business in 2006, leveraging off of our existing infrastructure both corporately and in the business sector.

Exhibit Index Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation, dated May 1, 2006

BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) ------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) All per share information has been adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend declared on December 15, 2005. For the Three Months Ended March 31, ------------------------------------ 2006 2005 ---- ---- Net sales $ 24,597 $ 19,340 Gross profit 8,222 7,182 Operating expenses 3,753 3,151 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 4,469 4,031 Other income (expense) (24) 38 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 4,445 4,069 Income tax expense 1,587 1,501 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 2,858 $ 2,568 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.25 $ 0.23 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.24 $ 0.21 Record net sales of $24.6 million were achieved for the quarter ended March 31, 2006. This is an increase of 27.2% above the $19.3 million result of the prior year comparable quarter. Net earnings for the first quarter were $2.9 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 11.3% as compared with the same period last year, and includes a $0.25 million expense recognizing the impact of SFAS 123R (equity based compensation) for the first time. This $2.9 million net earnings resulted in an increase in diluted net earnings of 14.3% to $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2006 versus $0.21 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year. In the first quarter of 2006, sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $9.8 million, an increase of 24.8% from the prior year comparable quarter. This includes $1.0 million of sales from the Loders Croklaan acquisition and $.88 million of sales from the Chelated Minerals Corporation (CMC) acquisition completed in February, 2006. Additional growth was driven principally by strength in sales of food ingredients and human choline products. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 18.5% to $1.04 million in the current period as compared to $0.88 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of $2.8 million on record quarterly sales of
BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) 2 $8.0 million. Net sales were 11.5% higher than the prior year comparable quarter, principally a result of increased sales of 100% ethylene oxide, ethylene oxide canisters and propylene oxide. Earnings from operations for this segment were 6.4% higher than the prior year quarter. The BCP Ingredients segment realized another record sales quarter of $6.9 million, increasing 57.1% over the prior year comparable quarter, with continued strong sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 19.9% to $0.66 million as compared to $0.55 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Earnings from this segment, while increasing, were unfavorably impacted by a scheduled plant turnaround that idled production of liquid choline for one week, but this action also increased our production capacity by approximately 15% going forward. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 was $8.2 million, an increase of 14.5% compared to $7.2 million for the prior year comparable period, due largely to the above noted increase in sales. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 19.1% to $3.8 million, as compared to $3.2 million for the prior year comparable quarter, equaling 15.3% of net sales, a reduction from the 16.3% of the prior year. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Early in the quarter, we borrowed $10 million, the proceeds of which were used to fund the previously noted acquisition of CMC, in part. The remaining balance of the $17.4 million purchase price of the acquisition was funded through Balchem's cash on hand. Our March 31, 2006 balance sheet reflects total net cash and investments of $6.3 million after recognition of the aforementioned acquisition and the re-payment of $2.8 million of the previously noted borrowings. Outlook Commenting on 2006, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "We are very pleased with the growth of all segments of the business, and are especially pleased with the integration and the accretive results of both the acquired Loders Croklaan assets and the CMC business. In the first quarter, we recognized a 4% sequential gross margin improvement from the fourth quarter of 2005, due to the previously discussed price increases, which were put in place to offset raw material cost increases. We also realized improvement at this level due to successful integration of the noted acquisitions. Our operating expenses increased by approximately $0.6 million from the prior year comparable quarter, of which $0.2 million was from SFAS 123R, additional technical and sales personnel from the acquisition of CMC, and we also spent approximately $0.2 million toward our targeted efforts into the pharmaceutical market. With these increases, we still reduced operating expenses from 16% to 15% of net sales. We expect to continue building on our larger business and human capital base throughout 2006, achieving double digit growth in sales and earnings over 2005". Non-GAAP Disclosures Certain disclosures prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) included in this release are accompanied by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management has determined that inclusion of these disclosures provides investors a meaningful presentation of the company's operating results in addition to the GAAP disclosure. This non-GAAP condensed consolidated statement of operations is provided to enhance overall understanding of our current financial performance and how management views operating results. The presentation of this non-GAAP information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not
BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) 3 necessarily comparable to non-GAAP results published by other companies. This non-GAAP disclosure and management's rationale for providing it is as follows: The reported net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 includes expenses related to the expensing of stock options and restricted stock awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R "Share Based Payments," which the Company adopted on January 1, 2006. Given the significance and non-cash nature of this expense relative to the operating results for the periods presented, this expense has been excluded from the following first quarter non-GAAP presentation. Excluding the impact of the SFAS 123R charges, net earnings increased 21.2% year-over-year to $3.1 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. These results equally compare to net income of $2.6 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the previously reported first quarter of 2005, which did not require recognition of SFAS 123R charges. Reconciliation of non-GAAP Earnings (in 000's, except per share data) Quarter Ended March 31, 2006 GAAP FAS 123R Non-GAAP ---- -------- -------- Basis Pro-Forma ----- --------- Net sales $ 24,597 $ -- $ 24,597 Gross profit 8,222 27 8,249 Operating expenses 3,753 (235) 3,518 -------- -------- -------- Earnings from operations 4,469 262 4,731 Other income (expense) (24) -- (24) -------- -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 4,445 262 4,707 Income tax expense 1,587 8 1,595 -------- -------- -------- Net earnings $ 2,858 $ 254 $ 3,112 ======== ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.25 $ 0.02 $ 0.27 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.24 $ 0.02 $ 0.26 Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be held on Monday, May 1, 2006 at 2:00 PM Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDT) to review first quarter 2006 results.

For the Three Months Ended June 30, ----------------------------------- 2006 2005 ---- ---- Net sales $ 25,100 $ 19,484 Gross profit 8,800 7,112 Operating expenses 3,930 2,833 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 4,870 4,279 Other income (expense) (57) 67 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 4,813 4,346 Income tax expense 1,758 1,616 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 3,055 $ 2,730 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.26 $ 0.24 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.25 $ 0.23 For the Six Months Ended June 30, --------------------------------- 2006 2005 ---- ---- Net sales $ 49,697 $ 38,824 Gross profit 17,022 14,294 Operating expenses 7,683 5,984 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 9,339 8,310 Other income (expense) (81) 105 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 9,258 8,415 Income tax expense 3,345 3,117 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 5,913 $ 5,298 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.51 $ 0.46 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.49 $ 0.44
Balchem Corporation (AMEX: BCP) 2 Record net sales of $25.1 million were achieved for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. This is an increase of 28.8% above the $19.5 million result of the prior year comparable quarter. Record net earnings for the second quarter were $3.1 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 11.9% as compared with the same period last year, and includes $0.2 million of expense to recognize the impact of SFAS 123R (equity based compensation) which the Company adopted on January 1, 2006. This $3.1 million in net earnings resulted in an increase in diluted net earnings of 8.7% to $0.25 per share for the second quarter of 2006 versus $0.23 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year. In the second quarter of 2006, sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were a record $10.5 million, an increase of 55.3% from the prior year comparable quarter. This includes $2.5 million of sales from the Chelated Minerals Corporation (CMC) and Loders Croklaan acquisitions. Additional organic growth was derived principally from strength in sales of food, nutritional and human choline products, which grew 18.6% over the prior year comparable period. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 66.3% to $1.01 million in the current period as compared to $0.61 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of $2.8 million on quarterly sales of $8.0 million, which were 5.3% higher than the prior year comparable quarter, principally a result of increased sales of ethylene oxide products and propylene oxide. Earnings from operations for this segment were 5.5% lower than the prior year quarter, primarily a result of higher raw material costs and the inclusion of $0.11 million for the aforementioned SFAS 123R expense. The BCP Ingredients segment achieved quarterly sales of $6.6 million, increasing 28.6% over the prior year comparable quarter, with continued strong sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. The overall increase in sales volume and a favorable product mix drove earnings from operations for this segment, improving 46.9% to a record $1.1 million, as compared to $0.74 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 was a record $8.8 million, or an increase of 23.7% compared to $7.1 million for the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the above noted increase in sales. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 38.7% to $3.9 million, as compared to $2.8 million for the prior year comparable quarter, equaling 15.7% of net sales. This was an increase from the 14.5% of the prior year, and was primarily due to the inclusion of $0.24 million of the SFAS 123R expense, additional amortization and selling expense resulting principally from the CMC acquisition and expenditures in support of our new pharmaceutical initiative. For the six months ended June 30, 2006, net sales have increased 28.0% to $49.7 million compared to $38.8 million in the comparable prior year period. Excluding the above noted acquisitions we have realized growth in the core segments of 16.7%, year over year. Net earnings increased 11.6% to $5.9 million or $0.49 per diluted share, from $5.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share in the prior year comparable period. Results for the six months ended June 30, 2006 includes SFAS 123R expense of $0.46 million, in this initial year of adoption. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Early in the first quarter, we borrowed $10 million, the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the CMC
Balchem Corporation (AMEX: BCP) 3 acquisition. On June 30, 2006, net cash and investments were $2.6 million, reflecting second quarter pre-payments of $5.0 million of the previously noted borrowings, reducing outstanding debt to $1.5 million at the end of the quarter. Outlook Commenting on 2006, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "We are very pleased with the growth of all segments of the business, and are especially pleased with the integration and the accretive results of the acquired CMC business. In the second quarter, we recognized a 7% sequential gross margin improvement from the first quarter of 2006, due to the product mix and the previously discussed price increases, which were put in place to offset raw material cost increases. We also realized improvement at this level due to the successful integration of the recent CMC acquisition. Our operating expenses increased as planned by approximately $1.1 million from the prior year comparable quarter as we added additional technical and sales personnel with the acquisition of CMC. We also spent approximately $0.3 million targeted at our efforts in the pharmaceutical market and $0.24 million was from SFAS 123R. We expect to continue building on our larger business and human capital base throughout 2006, achieving double digit growth in sales and earnings over 2005, and positioning for sustainable growth, going forward". Non-GAAP Disclosures Certain disclosures prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) included in this release are accompanied by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management has determined that inclusion of these disclosures provides investors a meaningful presentation of the company's operating results in addition to the GAAP disclosure. These non-GAAP condensed consolidated statements of operations are provided to enhance overall understanding of our current financial performance and how management views operating results. The presentation of this non-GAAP information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP results published by other companies. This non-GAAP disclosure and management's rationale for providing it is as follows: The reported net earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2006 includes expenses related to the expensing of stock options and restricted stock awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R "Share Based Payments," which the Company adopted on January 1, 2006. Given the significance and non-cash nature of this expense relative to the operating results for the periods presented, this expense has been excluded from the following second quarter and June 30th year-to-date non-GAAP presentations. Excluding the impact of the SFAS 123R charges, net earnings increased 19.4% quarter-over-quarter to $3.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. These results are comparable to net earnings of $2.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the previously reported second quarter of 2005, which did not require recognition of SFAS 123R charges. Excluding the impact of the SFAS 123R charges, net earnings increased 20.3% year-over-year to $6.4 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. These results are comparable to net income of $5.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the previously reported six months ended June 30, 2005, which did not require recognition of SFAS 123R charges.

Balchem Corporation (Amex: BCP) and its wholly owned subsidiary BCP Ingredients Inc. today announced the acquisition of an animal feed grade aqueous choline chloride manufacturing facility located in St. Gabriel, Louisiana.

EXHIBIT 99.1 BALCHEM CORPORATION (AMEX: BCP) ------------------------------- Reported as follows (unaudited) for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) All per share information has been adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend declared on December 15, 2005. For the Three Months Ended September 30, ---------------------------------------- 2006 2005 ---- ---- Net sales $ 25,122 $ 21,145 Gross profit 8,673 7,649 Operating expenses 3,692 2,918 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 4,981 4,731 Other income (expense) (3) 126 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 4,978 4,857 Income tax expense 1,827 1,833 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 3,151 $ 3,024 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.27 $ 0.26 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.26 $ 0.25 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, --------------------------------------- 2006 2005 ---- ---- Net sales $ 74,819 $ 59,969 Gross profit 25,695 21,943 Operating expenses 11,375 8,902 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 14,320 13,041 Other income (expense) (84) 231 -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 14,236 13,272 Income tax expense 5,172 4,950 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 9,064 $ 8,322 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.78 $ 0.72 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.75 $ 0.69
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) 2 Record net sales of $25.1 million were achieved for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. This is an increase of 18.8% above the $21.1 million result of the prior year comparable quarter. Record net earnings for the third quarter were $3.2 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 4.2% as compared with the same period last year. This result includes $0.2 million of expense to recognize the impact of SFAS 123R (equity based compensation), which the Company adopted on January 1, 2006, and $0.2 million of expenses to support our recent pharmaceutical initiative. The $3.2 million in net earnings resulted in an increase in diluted net earnings of 4.0% to $0.26 per share for the third quarter of 2006 versus $0.25 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year. Excluding the impact of the SFAS 123R charges, net earnings increased 11.0% quarter-over-quarter to $3.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. These results are comparable to net earnings of $3.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the previously reported third quarter of 2005, which did not require recognition of SFAS 123R charges. In the third quarter of 2006, sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $10.3 million, an increase of 21.7% from the prior year comparable quarter. This includes $1.2 million of sales from the Chelated Minerals Corporation (CMC) acquisition. Additional organic growth was derived principally from strength in sales of food, nutritional and human choline products, which grew 9.0% over the prior year comparable period. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 8.7% to $1.0 million in the current period as compared to $0.94 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of $2.9 million on quarterly sales of $8.0 million, which were 8.4% higher than the prior year comparable quarter, principally a result of increased sales of ethylene oxide products. Earnings from operations for this segment were 0.6% higher than the prior year quarter, primarily a result of the increased sales being partially offset by higher raw material costs and the inclusion of $0.12 million for the aforementioned SFAS 123R expense. The BCP Ingredients segment achieved quarterly sales of $6.8 million, increasing 28.7% over the prior year comparable quarter, with continued strong sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. The overall increase in sales volume drove earnings from operations for this segment, improving 16.0% to $1.1 million, as compared to $0.94 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The positive impact of the increased sales volume was partially offset by higher raw material costs in this segment also. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 was $8.7 million, or an increase of 13.4% compared to $7.6 million for the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the above noted increase in sales. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 26.5% to $3.7 million, as compared to $2.9 million for the prior year comparable quarter, equaling 14.7% of net sales. This was an increase from the 13.8% of the prior year, and was primarily due to the inclusion of $0.24 million of the SFAS 123R expense, additional amortization and selling expense resulting principally from the CMC acquisition and expenditures in support of our new pharmaceutical initiative. For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, net sales have increased 24.8% to $74.8 million compared to $60.0 million in the comparable prior year period. Excluding the acquisition of CMC, as well as the acquisition of certain assets of Loders Croklaan, we have realized growth in the core segments of 16.4%, year-over-year. Net earnings increased 8.9% to $9.1 million or $0.75 per diluted share, from $8.3 million, or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year comparable
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) 3 period. Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 includes SFAS 123R expense of $0.66 million, in this initial year of adoption. Excluding the impact of the SFAS 123R charges, net earnings increased 16.9% year-over-year to $9.7 million, or $0.80 per diluted share. These results are comparable to net income of $8.3 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the previously reported nine months ended September 30, 2005, which did not require recognition of SFAS 123R charges. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Early in the first quarter, we borrowed $10 million, the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the CMC acquisition. On September 30, 2006, net cash and investments were $2.7 million, reflecting third quarter payments of $1.5 million of the previously noted borrowings, resulting in no outstanding debt at the end of the quarter. Outlook Commenting on 2006, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "We are pleased with the overall performance of the business, and especially with our sequentially sustained level of profitability. We have successfully implemented price increases in select markets to deal with the persistent, elevated costs of raw materials, and we continue to position the company to grow solidly going forward. Our recent acquisitions are integrated, and while some areas of their cost structures are challenged, they are contributing consistently to our strategic direction. Outside acquisition funding has been completely retired, and we have initiated a number of cost reduction capital projects at our plant facilities to improve our cost position going forward. As noted in the last few earnings press releases, we do expect to deliver double digit growth in sales and earnings over 2005". Non-GAAP Disclosures Certain disclosures prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) included in this release are accompanied by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management has determined that inclusion of these disclosures provides investors a meaningful presentation of the company's operating results in addition to the GAAP disclosure. These non-GAAP condensed consolidated statements of operations are provided to enhance overall understanding of our current financial performance and how management views operating results. The presentation of this non-GAAP information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP results published by other companies. This non-GAAP disclosure and management's rationale for providing it is as follows: The reported net earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 includes expenses related to the expensing of stock options and restricted stock awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R "Share Based Payments," which the Company adopted on January 1, 2006. Given the significance and non-cash nature of this expense relative to the operating results for the periods presented, this expense has been excluded from the following third quarter and September 30th year-to-date non-GAAP presentations.

Item 5.02: Compensatory Arrangements for Certain Officers On December 8, 2006, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Balchem Corporation (the "Company") granted certain options to, authorized certain restricted stock arrangements for, and approved the bonus program for fiscal 2007 for its executive officers, including the executive officers who were listed as "named executive officers" in the Company's proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, Dino A. Rossi, the Company's President & Chief Executive Officer, Francis Fitzpatrick, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, David Ludwig, the Company's Vice President, General Manager ARC Specialty Products, Paul Richardson, the Company's Vice President, Research & Development, and Robert Miniger, the Company's Vice President, Human Resources. Options. The Board granted options to purchase shares of its Common Stock to certain executive officers of the Company pursuant to the Company's 1999 Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the "Plan"). Mr. Rossi, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mr. Ludwig, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Miniger were granted options to purchase 30,000, 23,000, 18,000, 15,000, and 7,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, at an exercise price of $26.71 per share. The options granted vest as follows: 20% on the first anniversary of the grant date; 40% on the second anniversary of the grant date; and 40% on the third anniversary of the grant date, and otherwise pursuant to the terms of the applicable Stock Option Grant agreement. These options expire on December 7, 2015. Restricted Stock. The Board authorized the Company to enter into Employee Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements (the "Employee Restricted Stock Agreements") with certain executive officers of the Company to purchase restricted shares of the Company's Common Stock pursuant to the Plan. The Board granted Mr. Rossi, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Mr. Ludwig, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Miniger the right to purchase up to 9,000, 3,000, 2,000, 3,000, and 1,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, respectively, at a purchase price equal to the par value of the shares ($.06-2/3 per share). The purchased stock is subject to a repurchase option in favor of the Company and to restrictions on transfer until it vests in accordance with the provisions of the Employee Restricted Stock Agreements. The purchased stock will vest in full four years from the date of the Employee Restricted Stock Agreements, or upon an earlier change of control of the Company (as defined in the Employee Restricted Stock Agreements), provided the purchaser is employed by the Company on that date. In the event the purchaser's employment with the Company is terminated for cause or upon the purchaser's voluntary resignation from the Company's employ, prior to vesting in full, the Company may repurchase all of the purchased shares at a purchase price of $.06-2/3 per share. The Company may repurchase a pro-rated amount of the purchased shares, based on the amount of time remaining until the vesting date, at a purchase price of $.06-2/3 per share in the event the purchaser ceases to be an employee of the Company prior to vesting by reason of: (1) the purchaser's voluntary retirement from the Company's employ at or after age 62; (2) the purchaser's death, major disability or significant illness; or (3) termination of the purchaser's employment by the Company without cause. Repurchases are subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board. Bonus Program. The Board also approved the Company's Incentive Compensation Program for the 2007 calendar year (the "ICP"). The ICP provides for the awarding of bonus compensation to executive officers and certain other employees, based
upon the level of achievement of specific goals established for the particular officer or employee, and for the weighting of those goals to determine the amount of the bonus. No bonuses are required to be paid under the ICP unless a specified minimum level of consolidated net income before interest and taxes ("NIBIT") is achieved. The Target Bonuses of the named executive officers of the Company is based upon a percentage of each executive officer's base yearly salary and is set forth in the table below. Name Target Bonus ---- ------------ Dino A. Rossi 50% Francis Fitzpatrick 35% David Ludwig 35% Paul Richardson 35% Robert Miniger 35% The Compensation Committee of the Board will determine actual bonus amounts paid to the executive officers, which may be higher or lower than the Target Bonus, based upon each executive officer's performance relative to the specific established performance goals upon which the Target Bonus amounts were based. Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement between the Company and Mr. Rossi, Mr. Rossi is entitled to annual bonus of up to 100% of his base salary, based upon Balchem achieving operating and/or financial targets established by the Board or an authorized committee thereof. Half of such bonus compensation is determined pursuant to the ICP. The Compensation Committee has established a minimum level of consolidated net income for the 2007 fiscal year to be achieved by the Company in order for Mr. Rossi to be entitled to the portion of such bonus compensation not covered by the ICP. The foregoing description of the terms of Employee Restricted Stock Agreements and the Stock Option Grant agreements is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of such agreements, the forms of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively. Item 7.01: Regulation FD. On December 12, 2006, the Company issued a press release announcing that on December 8, 2006 the Board of Directors of the Company approved and declared a 3-for-2 stock split, to be effected in the form of a stock dividend on its issued and outstanding Common Stock, as of 5:00 PM, New York City time, on December 29, 2006. Also, the Board of Directors of Balchem declared a cash dividend of $0.09 per share on all issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock held as of such record date, with the number of shares to which such cash dividend is to apply adjusted to give effect to the stock dividend. Both dividends will be payable on January 19, 2007 to stockholders of record as of the December 29, 2006 record date.

Adjustments for Stock Splits, Stock Dividends, etc. If from time to --------------------------------------------------- time while the Shares are subject to the repurchase option, or restrictions on transfer set forth herein, there is any stock split-up, stock dividend, stock distribution or other reclassification of the stock of the Company, any and all new, substituted or additional securities to which the Purchaser is entitled by reason of his ownership of the Shares shall be immediately subject to such repurchase option and restrictions on transfer in the same manner and to the same extent as the Shares and the price payable to the Purchaser upon the Company's exercise of the repurchase option shall be appropriately adjusted. 9. Remedies. (a) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that any -------- violation of the provisions of this Agreement will cause irreparable damage to the Company and that the Company will have no adequate remedy at law for such violation. Accordingly, the Purchaser agrees that the Company shall be entitled as a matter of right to an injunction, specific performance or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, restraining any further violation of such provision or affirmatively compelling the Purchaser to carry out his or her obligations hereunder. Such right to equitable relief shall be cumulative and in addition to any other right or remedy the Company may have at law or in equity. -5-
(b) In the event that the Purchaser fails to deliver any certificates representing Shares required to be transferred to the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Company may (i) elect to establish a segregated account in which the purchase price for such Shares shall be placed, such account to be turned over to the Purchaser upon delivery of the certificates representing such Shares together with appropriate instruments of transfer duly executed by the Purchaser, and (ii) immediately thereafter take such action as may be required to transfer record title to such Shares to itself. The Purchaser hereby grants the Company a power of attorney for effecting any transfer in accordance with the previous sentence, such power of attorney to be deemed coupled with an interest and irrevocable. 10. Section 83(b) Election. Purchaser understands that under Section 83 ---------------------- of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the difference between the purchase price paid for the Shares and their fair market value on the date any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such Shares lapse will be reported as ordinary income at that time. For this purpose, the term "forfeiture restrictions" includes the right of the Company to repurchase the Shares pursuant to its repurchase option under Section 5 of this Agreement. Purchaser understands that Purchaser may elect to be taxed at the time the Shares are acquired hereunder to the extent the fair market value of the Shares differs from the purchase price rather than when and as such Shares cease to be subject to such forfeiture restrictions, by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the Code with the I.R.S. within thirty (30) days after the date of purchase hereunder. If the fair market value of the Shares at the date of purchase equals the purchase price paid (and thus no tax is payable), the election must be made to avoid adverse tax consequences in the future. Purchaser understands that failure to make this filing within the thirty (30) day period will result in the recognition of ordinary income by the Purchaser (in the event the fair market value of the Shares increases after the date of purchase) as the forfeiture restrictions lapse. PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS PURCHASER'S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE COMPANY'S, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(b). PURCHASER IS RELYING SOLELY ON PURCHASER'S ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO FILE AN 83(b) ELECTION. PURCHASER ALSO AGREES TO PROVIDE COMPANY WITH A COPY OF THE 83(b) ELECTION IF SO FILED. 11. Withholding. The Company shall have the right to deduct from ----------- payments of any kind otherwise due to the Purchaser any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to any of the Shares issued hereunder. 12. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision ------------ of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement and each other provision of this Agreement shall be severable and enforceable to the extent permitted by law. 13. Waiver; Amendment. No provision of this Agreement shall be waived ------------------ or amended, either generally or in any particular instance, except in a writing signed by the Company and the Purchaser. 14. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to --------------- the benefit of the Company and the Purchaser and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, legal -6-
representatives, successors and assigns. No transfer of any of the Shares shall be effective unless the transferee first agrees in writing to all of the terms hereof. 15. No Rights To Employment. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall ----------------------- be construed as giving the Purchaser any right to be retained, in any position, as an employee of or consultant or advisor to the Company. 16. Notices. All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in ------- writing and deemed effectively given upon personal delivery, delivery by Federal Express or other recognized overnight delivery service or upon deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, if to the Company at its executive offices and if to the Purchaser at the address shown beneath his or her signature to this Agreement, or in either case at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section. 17. Pronouns. Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in -------- this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. 18. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents and agreements ----------------- referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. 19. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and ------------- enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

The Shares are issued pursuant to the Company's --------------- Amended and Restated 1999 Stock Plan, a copy of which has been furnished to the Purchaser, and are subject to such Plan in all respects. 21. Section 409A Compliance. This Stock Purchase Right is intended to ------------------------ comply with the requirements of Section 409A, and the regulations issued thereunder. To the extent of any inconsistencies with the requirements of Section 409A, the Stock Purchase Right shall be interpreted and amended in order to meet such Section 409A requirements. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or in any amendments attached hereto to the contrary, it is the intent of the Corporation to have this Plan interpreted and construed to comply with any and all provisions Section 409A including any subsequent amendments, rulings or interpretations from appropriate governmental agencies.

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Balchem Corporation Announces Stock Split and Increase in Cash Dividend New Hampton, New York. December 12, 2006. Ba1chem Corporation (Amex: BCP) today announced that its Board of Directors has voted to approve a 3-for-2 stock split, to be effected in the form of a stock dividend, and also a cash dividend of $0.09 per share. For purposes of the cash dividend, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock to which it will apply will give effect to the stock dividend. Both dividends will be payable on January 19, 2007 to stockholders of record as of December 29, 2006. Pursuant to the stock dividend, a stockholder will receive for each two shares of Balchem Common Stock held of record on December 29, 2006, one additional share of Common Stock. Stockholders will also receive $0.09 per share of Common Stock on a post stock split basis. Stockholders entitled to fractional shares resulting from the stock dividend will receive cash in lieu of such fractional shares based upon the closing price of Balchem's Common Stock on the record date. The stock split to be effected by means of the stock dividend will increase the number of Common Shares outstanding from approximately 11,767,000 to 17,650,500 shares. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, stated: "This action by the Board of Directors recognizes the company's quality financial performance and the Board's confidence in the management to continue delivering positive results. The cash dividend represents an increase of 50 percent over last year's dividend and allows us to reward our current shareholders while ensuring access to the capital necessary to fund our growth efforts. The stock dividend will improve the opportunity to add liquidity and appeal for our stock, providing enhanced value to Balchem shareholders." Brokers should instruct Balchem's transfer agent by January 12, 2007 as to their requirements for full shares or cash with respect to stock registered in their names as nominees.

Exhibit 99.1 BALCHEM CORPORATION (NASDAQ: BCPC) ---------------------------------- reported as follows (unaudited) for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) All per share information has been adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend declared on December 12, 2006. For the Three Months Ended December 31, --------------------------------------- 2006 2005 --------- --------- Net sales $ 26,086 $ 23,126 Gross profit 8,311 6,737 Operating expenses 3,469 2,875 --------- --------- Earnings from operations 4,842 3,862 Other income 23 57 --------- --------- Earnings before income tax expense 4,865 3,919 Income tax expense 1,651 1,287 --------- --------- Net earnings $ 3,214 $ 2,632 ========= ========= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.18 $ 0.15 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.17 $ 0.15 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, ---------------------------------------- 2006 2005 --------- --------- Net sales $ 100,905 $ 83,095 Gross profit 34,006 28,680 Operating expenses 14,844 11,777 --------- --------- Earnings from operations 19,162 16,903 Other income (expense) (61) 288 --------- --------- Earnings before income tax expense 19,101 17,191 Income tax expense 6,823 6,237 --------- --------- Net earnings $ 12,278 $ 10,954 ========= ========= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.70 $ 0.63 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.67 $ 0.61
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) 2 New Record Quarter Results for Net Sales and Net Earnings Record Net Sales of $26.1 million were achieved for the quarter ended ---------------- December 31, 2006. This is an increase of 12.8% above the $23.1 million result of the prior year comparable quarter. Record Net Earnings for the fourth quarter ------------------- were $3.2 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 22.1% as compared with the same period last year. This result includes $0.2 million of expense, net of tax, to recognize the impact of SFAS 123R (equity based compensation), which the Company adopted on January 1, 2006. The $3.2 million in net earnings resulted in an increase in diluted net earnings of 20.1% to $0.17 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 versus $0.15 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year. Excluding the impact of the SFAS 123R charges in 2006, net earnings increased 30.6% quarter-over-quarter to $3.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. These results are comparable to net earnings of $2.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the previously reported fourth quarter of 2005, which did not require recognition of SFAS 123R charges. In the fourth quarter of 2006, sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $10.9 million, an increase of 16.2% from the prior year comparable quarter. This includes $1.8 million of sales from the Chelated Minerals Corporation (CMC) acquisition. Additional organic growth was derived principally from strength in sales of human choline products, which grew 42.2% over the prior year comparable period and strong sales of REASHURE(R) our animal nutrition and health product targeted for dairy cows. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 42.6% to $1.1 million in the current period as compared to $0.79 million in the comparable quarter of the prior year. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of $2.9 million on record quarterly sales of $8.1 million. Earnings from operations for this segment were 10.9% higher than the prior year quarter, primarily a result of the increased sales. The BCP Ingredients segment achieved record quarterly sales of $7.1 million, increasing 10.7% over the prior year comparable quarter, with continued strong sales volumes in dry and aqueous choline products for the poultry and swine industries. The overall increase in sales volume drove earnings from operations for this segment, improving to $.81 million, as compared to $0.45 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 was $8.3 million, or an increase of 23.4% compared to $6.7 million for the prior year comparable period, primarily due to the above noted increase in sales. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 20.7% to $3.5 million, as compared to $2.9 million for the prior year comparable quarter, equaling 13.3% of net sales. This was an increase from the 12.4% of the prior year, and was primarily due to the inclusion of $0.3 million of the SFAS 123R expense, additional amortization and selling expense resulting principally from the CMC acquisition and expenditures in support of our ongoing pharmaceutical initiative. We set new net sales and net earnings records for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, as net sales increased 21.4% to $100.9 million from $83.1 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings increased 12.1% to $12.3 million, or $.67 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $11.0 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Excluding the acquisition of CMC, as well as the acquisition of certain assets of Loders Croklaan, we have realized net sales growth in the core segments of 14.2%, year-over-year. Results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 includes SFAS 123R expense of $1.1 million, in this initial year of adoption. Excluding the impact of the SFAS 123R charges, reported net earnings would have increased 20.2% year-over-year to $13.2 million, or $0.72 per
Balchem Corporation (AMEX:BCP) 3 diluted share. These results are comparable to net income of $11.0 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, for the previously reported twelve months ended December 31, 2005, which did not require recognition of SFAS 123R charges. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. In the first quarter of 2006, we borrowed $10 million, the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the CMC acquisition. On December 31, 2006, net cash and investments were $5.2 million, reflecting prepayment of the previously noted borrowings, resulting in no outstanding debt at the end of the year. Outlook Commenting on 2006, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "We are pleased with the overall performance of the business, especially when one equalizes the effect of SFAS 123R. This, combined with the results derived from the CMC acquisition and the domestic food business of the Loders acquisition, highlights our successful strategic integration and direction as we build off of our strong base of technology and business. We continued to invest in our pharmaceutical initiative, which, while costing us approximately $1MM for the year, is consistent with our plan, and our technology base is being leveraged nicely with quality data being generated to support this new strategic direction. We look to 2007 with continued double digit growth expectations from the newly defined core businesses, including continued spending toward our pharmaceutical objectives, in both sales and earnings." Non-GAAP Disclosures Certain disclosures prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) included in this release are accompanied by disclosures that are not prepared in conformity with GAAP. Management has determined that inclusion of these disclosures provides investors a meaningful presentation of the company's operating results in addition to the GAAP disclosure. These non-GAAP condensed consolidated statements of operations are provided to enhance overall understanding of our current financial performance and how management views operating results. The presentation of this non-GAAP information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP results published by other companies. This non-GAAP disclosure and management's rationale for providing it is as follows: The reported net earnings for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 includes expenses related to the expensing of stock options and restricted stock awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R "Share Based Payments," which the Company adopted on January 1, 2006. Given the significance and non-cash nature of this expense relative to the operating results for the periods presented, this expense has been excluded from the following fourth quarter and December 31st year-to-date non-GAAP presentations.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement. Asset Purchase Agreement ------------------------ On March 16, 2007, Balchem Corporation ("Balchem" or the "Company"), through its wholly-owned subsidiary BCP Ingredients, Inc. ("BCP"), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Chinook Global Limited ("Chinook"), a privately held Ontario corporation, pursuant to which BCP acquired certain of Chinook's choline chloride business assets for a purchase price of $29,000,000, plus the value of certain product inventories estimated at approximately $1,840,000. The acquisition closed effective the same date. The inventory purchase price is subject to adjustment based upon Chinook's actual finished goods and raw materials inventory as of the closing date. The parties have agreed to hold approximately $276,000 of the purchase price in a cash escrow account for a brief period after the closing to secure such purchase price adjustment. The assets acquired by BCP pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement include Chinook's finished product and raw material inventories and most of its customer accounts (including supply contracts and goodwill), which have a significant international presence in the choline and choline derivatives markets. The addition of the Chinook customer accounts is expected to add approximately $40,000,000 of new revenue per annum to BCP and contribute in excess of $6,000,000 per annum to the Company's EBITDA (defined as earnings before depreciation, amortization, interest expenses and taxes). The assets acquired by BCP did not include Chinook's choline manufacturing facilities in Sombra and Morrisburg, Ontario; however, under the Asset Purchase Agreement, BCP has a three-month right of negotiation for the purchase of the Morrisburg facility. In addition, BCP has a right to purchase equipment located at both facilities and the cost of such is effectively included in the purchase price. The Asset Purchase Agreement contains, among other things, customary representations and warranties of the parties, customary indemnities, and other customary provisions. In addition to the Asset Purchase Agreement, BCP entered into a Tolling Agreement of same date with Chinook, under which Chinook will manufacture dry choline chloride for Balchem for an interim period after closing not to exceed one year. In connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement and as an inducement for BCP to enter into the transaction, BCP entered into an agreement with Chinook and the shareholders of Chinook under which such shareholders and Chinook agreed not to compete with BCP in the choline chloride industry for a period of ten years following the closing date (the "Non-Competition Agreement"). The foregoing description of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Tolling Agreement and the Non-Competition Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the terms and provisions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Tolling Agreement and the Non-Competition Agreement, which are attached hereto as Exhibits 2.1, 10.1 and 10.2, respectively. On March 19, 2007, the Company issued a press release announcing the entry into the Asset Purchase Agreement. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.

Seller covenants and agrees that as a condition to any sale or other disposition of such real property occurring within 10 years of the Closing Date, Seller shall require the purchaser, lessees, licensee or other occupants of the Facilities (excluding any lender providing secured financing in an amount greater than or equal to $1 million to Seller or any purchaser upon the exercise of remedies by such lender involving the transfer of the Facilities) to agree to be bound by the form of non-competition agreement attached to the Consent Agreement. For clarity, a purchaser of any of the equipment or other removable property contained in or located at the Facilities as of the Effective Time that does not purchase the Facilities shall not be required to enter into any such agreement; provided, however, that the Seller shall not sell all or substantially all of such equipment to any such purchaser that, to Seller's Knowledge, intends to use such equipment within North America to compete with the Buyer in the Business.

Within 30 days after the Closing Date, or as they become due, Seller shall pay to customers all payments due for Non-Contingent Rebates arising out of sales of Business products by Seller prior to Closing. Buyer shall pay to customers, when due, all payments due for Non-Contingent Rebates arising out of sales of Business products by Buyer after the Closing. (b) Section 5.2(b) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth all rebate programs extended by Seller to customers with respect to sales of Business products for which Seller has an obligation arising out of sales made prior to Closing (i) only if sales of Business products made by Buyer to such customers after the Closing reach a certain level, (ii) that cannot be calculated as of the Closing without considering sales made by Buyer after the Closing or (iii) that cannot be calculated as of the Closing until Seller receives additional information from the applicable customers after the Closing (the "Contingent Rebates").

(b) In the event that the Buyer receives payment on any Seller Accounts Receivable, the Buyer shall hold such payment in trust for the Seller and shall immediately remit such payment to the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

In the event that the Seller receives any additional payments by a customer in 14
respect of accounts receivable of the Business after such time as the Seller has received payment in full for such customer's Seller Accounts Receivable, the Seller shall hold any such payment in trust for the Buyer and promptly remit any such payment to the Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 5.4 Transferred Employees.

Each Transferred Employee shall be engaged to perform duties on behalf of Buyer similar to those performed in the position currently held by the Transferred Employee.

During such three month period, Seller agrees that it will not offer to sell such Facility without first notifying Buyer and allowing Buyer a reasonable opportunity to exercise the right of negotiation described in the preceding sentence. 5.9 Customer Contract Liability. Pursuant to a certain Assumed Contract, Buyer shall be obligated following Closing to provide certain amounts of Business products to a certain customer free of charge. Seller agrees to continue to bear the economic burden of this obligation, in furtherance of which Seller agrees that, promptly after the Closing, Seller shall contact such customer and use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate with such customer to amend such contract to eliminate such obligation to provide free Business products, which efforts shall include an offer by the Seller to satisfy the obligation with a cash payment from the Seller to such customer in an amount equal to the remaining amount of free Business products to which such customer is entitled. In the event that Seller is unable to satisfy such obligation to such customer within three months after Closing, in consideration of Buyer's assumption of such obligation, Seller agrees to pay to an account or accounts designated in writing by Buyer such amount as is necessary to make Buyer whole for assuming the obligation to provide free Business products pursuant to the Assumed Contract. 5.10 Certain Deliveries.

Notwithstanding anything set forth in Article VI to the contrary: (a) Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any liability under Section 6.2(a) or 6.3(a) for any breaches of its representations and warranties, unless and until the total amount of the Damages under such subsection exceed $100,000, provided that in the event the aggregate Damages exceeds $100,000, then Seller or Buyer, as applicable, shall be liable for all such Damages in full from the first dollar of loss. (b) Seller shall have no liability under Section 6.2 to the extent the total amount of the Damages under such Section exceeds 20% of the Purchase Price. Buyer shall have no liability under Section 6.3 to the extent the total amount of the Damages under such Section exceeds 20% of the Purchase Price. The aforementioned limitation regarding liability shall not apply to Damages arising out of fraud, willful misconduct or the Retained Liabilities. (c) No indemnification shall be required by Seller under Section 6.2(a) unless Seller shall have received notice of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Buyer on or before the date one year after the Closing Date; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1 (Organization; Good Standing), 3.2 (Authority; Enforceability), 3.11 (Title to Personal Property) and 3.15 (Brokers). No other indemnification shall be required by Seller under Section 6.2 (including as to breaches of the representations and warranties excluded from the preceding limitation) unless Seller shall have received notice of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Buyer on or before the date three years after the Closing Date. (d) No indemnification payment shall be required by Buyer under Section 6.3(a) unless Buyer shall have received notice of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Seller on or before the date one year after the Closing Date; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1 (Organization; Good standing), 4.2 (Authority; Enforceability) and 4.5 (Brokers).

(e) All Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party shall be net of insurance proceeds and any amounts such Indemnified Party recovers from third parties. The amount of any Damages may be offset by any actual net Tax savings realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages in the taxable year in which such Damages are incurred or in any preceding taxable year as a result of the use of net operating loss carrybacks. In such event, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party the actual amount of such tax savings realized. In computing the amount of any such tax benefit, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize all other income gain, loss, deduction, or credit before recognizing any item arising from the incurrence or payment of any indemnified Damages. If the Indemnified Party does not realize any net Tax savings in the taxable year in which such Damages are incurred (or in any proceeding taxable year), but will realize a net Tax savings in a subsequent year, the Damages shall be reduced by the present value of the net Tax savings expected to be received, determined by discounting the expected payment by the Prime Rate in effect on the date of the Indemnified Party's incurrence of the Damages. (f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to indemnify, hold harmless or otherwise compensate any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party, respectively, for damage to reputation, lost business opportunities, lost profits, mental or emotional distress, consequential, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages, interference with business operations or diminution in value. For all purposes of this Agreement, the term "Damages" shall be deemed not to include any such non-reimbursable damages. (g) Upon any payment of Damages to an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party with respect to the Damages to which such indemnification relates; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party will only be subrogated to the extent of any amount paid by it pursuant to this Agreement in connection with such Damages. 6.5 Procedure for Indemnification - Third-Party Claims. -------------------------------------------------- (a) If any party shall claim indemnification hereunder arising from any claim or demand of a third party, the party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall notify the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the basis for such claim or demand setting forth the nature of the claim or demand in reasonable detail. The failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder except to the extent that the defense of such claim or demand is prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. (b) If any Proceeding is brought by a third party against an Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party gives notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 6.5(a), the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes, to assume the defense of such Proceeding, if (i) the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party intends to undertake such defense, (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the third-party claim actively and diligently with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and (iii) the Indemnifying Party is a party to the Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party has not determined in good faith that joint 19
representation would be inappropriate because of a conflict in interest. The Indemnified Party shall, in its sole discretion, have the right to employ separate counsel (who may be selected by the Indemnified Party in its sole discretion) in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense or compromise of such claim or demand. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Party's consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party and no material adverse effect on any other claims then pending against the Indemnified Party and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party (subject to the deductible set forth in Section 6.4(a)). (c) If (i) notice is given to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any third-party Proceeding and the Indemnifying Party does not, within 15 days after the Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, (ii) any of the conditions set forth in clauses (i)-(iii) of Section 6.5(b) above become unsatisfied, or (iii) it is reasonably likely that the Proceeding may adversely and materially affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification from the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement (subject to the deductible set forth in Section 6.4(a)), the Indemnified Party shall (upon notice to the Indemnifying Party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party shall remain responsible for any indemnifiable amounts arising from such third-party claim to the extent provided in this Article VI. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) of the preceding sentence, the Indemnifying Party, after additional investigation into the Proceeding, may later elect to assume the defense of the Proceeding upon 20 days' notice to the Indemnified Party; provided that both (x) such notice is provided no later than 180 days after the Indemnified Party's first written notice to the Indemnifying Party of such Proceeding and (y) the Indemnifying Party reimburses the Indemnified Party for all out-of-pocket costs expended by such party in the defense through such date of assumption and, in such event, the Indemnified Party shall retain its rights as set forth in subsection (ii) and (iii) of the preceding sentence. The Indemnifying Party may at any time elect to participate in such Proceedings, negotiations or defense at any time at its own expense. 6.6 Indemnification Procedure - Direct Claims. ----------------------------------------- (a) If an Indemnified Party shall claim indemnification hereunder for any claim other than third-party claims, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of the basis for such claim setting forth the nature and amount of the Damages resulting from such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall give written notice of any disagreement with such claim within 30 days following receipt of the Indemnified Party's notice of the claim, specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of such disagreement. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are unable to resolve any disagreement within 30 days following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the notice referred to in the preceding sentence, then the parties hereto agree to arbitrate any direct claim for Damages less than $1,000,000 (an "Arbitration Dispute") pursuant to this Section 6.6(a). With respect to any direct claim for Damages equal to or greater 20
than $1,000,000, arbitration shall not be mandatory hereunder and the parties shall be free to seek resolution of such dispute in state or federal courts. (b) With respect to any Arbitration Dispute, either party may commence arbitration proceedings with the CPR Institute for Arbitration Dispute Resolution ("CPR") office by filing a demand for arbitration in writing (a "Demand") with the CPR and by simultaneously sending a copy of the Demand to the other party. The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by and decided in accordance with the CPR Rules for Non-Administered Arbitration (the "CPR Rules") then in effect, unless the parties shall mutually agree otherwise in writing. Any evidentiary rules not expressly provided by the CPR Rules shall be determined in accordance with the Federal Rules of Evidence. The arbitration shall be governed by the U.S. Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. ss. 1, et seq. and shall be administered under the procedures set forth herein. (c) The arbitration panel to be selected (the "Arbitrators") shall be a balanced panel, consisting of (i) three independent and impartial arbitrators selected pursuant to CPR Rule 6.4 in the event the total amount in the Arbitration Dispute is $1 million or more; or (ii) one independent and impartial arbitrator selected pursuant to CPR Rule 6.4 in the event the total amount in the Arbitration Dispute is less than $1 million. (d) The arbitration shall be conducted in Detroit, Michigan; provided that the Arbitrator(s) may, for the convenience of the parties and without changing the site of the arbitration proceeding, permit the taking of evidence outside of Detroit, Michigan. (e) The Arbitrator(s) shall permit and facilitate discovery pursuant to CPR Rule 11, except that for claims involving $1 million or less no depositions shall be permitted; and for claims involving more than $1 million, each party shall be limited to two depositions. These limits on depositions shall not be modified without the written consent of all parties to the arbitration. Within 30 days after selection of a panel, the party filing the demand for arbitration shall provide copies of all business documents and other evidence in its possession that support its demand. Within 30 days of receipt of such information, the receiving party shall produce all business documents and evidence that support its defense or response. Thereafter, each party shall have the right to such other discovery procedures as the Arbitrator(s) may determine to be reasonably necessary for a fair understanding of any legitimate issue raised in the arbitration. A party's failure to timely disclose documents, witnesses, expert reports, calculations and other evidence relating to the Arbitration Dispute shall operate as a bar to the nondisclosing party's use of such evidence, and, in the Arbitrator's(s') discretion, be a basis for sanctions, including an award against the nondisclosing party. (f) It is the intention of the parties hereto that the arbitration proceeding be completed through the rendering of the award within six months of the selection of the Arbitrator(s), and each party hereto shall so instruct the Arbitrator(s) and take such other actions as may be reasonably required to give effect to such intention. The arbitration hearing shall be no longer than five consecutive Business Days to be equally divided between the parties. These timing requirements cannot be modified unless mutually agreed by the parties in writing. The award of the Arbitrator(s) may be monetary damages, an order requiring performance of obligations under this Agreement or any other appropriate award or remedy. Nor may the Arbitrator(s) make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 21
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Arbitrator(s) shall not be authorized or empowered to award punitive, exemplary, consequential or special damages, and the parties expressly waive any claim to such damages. (g) The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be shared equally by the parties and advanced by them from time to time as required; provided, that at the conclusion of the arbitration, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all attorneys' fees, filing fees, costs, including the costs of the arbitration previously advanced, expert fees and costs, and related expenses from the non-prevailing party and such recovery shall be made part of any judgment or arbitration award. (h) The final award rendered by the Arbitrator(s) (after any CPR appeal allowed herein) shall be final and binding upon the parties and judgment may be entered by any competent court having jurisdiction thereof. In the event of an arbitration award of Damages less than $500,000 (inclusive of costs, fees and interest), such award shall not be subject to appeal. In the event the award exceeds $500,000 (inclusive of any award of costs, fees and interest), an appeal may be taken under the CPR Arbitration Appeal Procedure from any final award of an arbitral panel arising out of or related to this Agreement. Such appeal must conform to the requirements of the CPR Arbitration Appeal Procedure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this paragraph and without prejudice to the above procedures, any of the parties may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for temporary injunctive judicial relief if such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status quo until such time as the arbitration panel is convened and available to hear such party's request for temporary relief. The award rendered by the Arbitrator(s), after any appeal taken pursuant to the foregoing, shall be final and not subject to judicial review, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The award of the Arbitrator(s) shall be accompanied by a written explanation of the basis for the award. Any amount owing by any Person as a result of this Section 6.6 shall be paid within two Business Days after final determination of such amount. 6.7 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, the right to indemnification and other rights under this Article VI shall constitute Buyer's and Seller's sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any and all claims arising under or relating to this Agreement, any agreement or document executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except for claims arising out of fraud, willful breach or failure to satisfy or pay Retained Liabilities. In furtherance of the foregoing, from and after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of Buyer and Seller hereby waive, release the other party (and its Affiliates, employees and agents) from, and covenant not to sue or institute legal proceedings with respect to, and shall cause any of their Affiliates to waive, release the other party (and its Affiliates, employees and agents) from, and covenant not to sue or institute legal proceedings with respect to, any and all rights, claims and causes of action that they may have against any other party or its Affiliates in connection with such transactions, except those arising under this Article VI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, in the event a party would be irreparably injured by a breach of a covenant set forth in this Agreement and monetary remedies would be inadequate to protect a party hereto or its subsidiaries against such breach, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies otherwise available to the parties, such party shall be entitled to seek applicable equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction. 22
ARTICLE VII GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.1 Expenses.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless signed in writing by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party shall be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party shall be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement. Any consent required or permitted by this Agreement is binding only if in writing. 7.4 Notices.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of 25
this Agreement held invalid, illegal or unenforceable only in part or degree shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable, and the determination that any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable as applied to particular circumstances shall not affect the application of such provision to circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable. 7.11 Counterparts.

Each such invoice shall contain reasonably sufficient detail to allow Balchem to determine the composition of the Service Price set out in such invoice. Balchem shall pay each such invoice within five business days of the date of such invoice. All such payments shall be made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by the Manufacturer.

The Deposit shall be applied to the invoice for the Service Price for the last month of the term of this 4
Agreement, and if the Deposit exceeds the invoice amount for such month, the Manufacturer shall promptly refund such excess to Balchem by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Balchem.

The Manufacturer's maximum aggregate liability (including any indemnification obligation) under this Agreement whether based on breach of contract or in tort (including negligence) under any warranty or otherwise shall in no event exceed the purchase price of the services provided by the Manufacturer with respect to which any related claim is made.

The Shareholders, through Chinook Lacy, Inc.; Chinook Kennedy, Inc.; and 2097299 Ontario Limited, own all of the outstanding capital stock of the Seller. Immediately following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, the Buyer will be engaged in the Business. The entering into of this Agreement by the Seller and the Shareholders is a condition precedent to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. Statement of Agreement The parties agree as follows: 1. Definitions. The capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 2. Non-competition. As an inducement for the Buyer to enter into the Purchase Agreement and in consideration for the Buyer's consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Seller and each Shareholder agree that: (a) For a period of ten (10) years following the Closing Date (the "Term"), neither the Seller nor any Shareholder nor any of their Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, engage or invest in, or own, manage, operate, finance, control or participate in the ownership, management, operation, financing or control of any Person engaged in, the Business (each, a "Competitor"), in each case in the following geographic areas: the United States, Canada, North America and the world; provided, however, that the Shareholders and the Seller, together with such Persons' Affiliates, in the aggregate, may purchase or otherwise acquire up to (but not more than) 5% of any class of securities of any enterprise (but without otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if such securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;
provided further, however, that a Shareholder may be employed by a Competitor in an area or unit of the Competitor's business whose products, services, or activities do not compete with the Business; provided further, however, that the Seller and the Shareholders may engage in the Business to the extent necessary to comply with the terms of, and fulfill the Seller's obligations under, any sales agreement or supply agreement in effect, or purchase order outstanding, as of the Closing Date that is not assumed by the Buyer. (b) The parties agree that none of the provisions of this section apply to the activities contemplated in the Tolling Agreement. (c) Each Shareholder shall, within ten days after accepting any employment, consulting engagement, engagement as an independent contractor, partnership or other association with a Competitor during the Term, advise such Competitor that such Shareholder is bound by this Agreement. (d) If any provision or part of Section 2 is unenforceable because of its duration or its geographic coverage, or because it is too expansive in any other respect, the parties hereto agree to modify this Section 2, and that the court making such determination shall have the power to interpret and modify this Section 2, to reduce the duration, the geographic coverage, or such other provision and to delete specific words or phrases herefrom ("blue-penciling"), so that this Section 2 shall extend over the longest time, the largest geographic area and in any other respect as is enforceable under applicable law and, in its reduced or blue-penciled form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced. 3. Reasonable Restraint. The Seller and each Shareholder acknowledge that (i) the Business is international in scope; (ii) the products and services related to the Business are marketed throughout the world; (iii) the Business competes with other businesses that are or could be located in any part of the world; (iv) the Buyer has required that the Seller and each Shareholder make the covenants set forth in this Agreement as a condition to the Buyer's consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and would not otherwise consummate such transactions; (v) the provisions of this Agreement impose a reasonable restraint on the Seller and are necessary to protect and preserve the Buyer's interests in and right to the use of the assets of the Business and the operation of the Businesses from and after Closing; (vi) the Shareholders, as equity owners of the Seller, will benefit from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; and (vii) the Buyer would be irreparably damaged if the Seller or any Shareholder were to breach the covenants set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement. 4. Injunctive Relief and Additional Remedy. The Seller and each Shareholder acknowledge that the injury that would be suffered by the Buyer as a result of a breach of the provisions of this Agreement (including any provision of Section 2) would be irreparable and that an award of monetary damages alone to the Buyer for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy.

Without limiting any party's equitable rights, remedies or defenses, to the extent available under applicable law, the existence of any claim or cause of action of the Seller, any Shareholder or their respective Affiliates against the Buyer or its Affiliates, whether predicated on the Purchase Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Buyer or its Affiliates of this Agreement. 6. Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom such amendment, modification or supplement is sought to be enforced. Any such writing must refer specifically to this Agreement. 7. Assignment; No Third-Party Rights.

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement may be executed on signature pages exchanged by facsimile, in which event each party shall promptly deliver to the others such number of original executed copies as the others may reasonably request [Signatures appear on following page.] 3

Box 600, 52 Sunrise Park Road, New Hampton, New York 10955 (herein called the "Company"), hereby promises to pay to the order of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (successor by merger to Fleet National Bank) a national banking association having an office at Peter D. Kiernan Plaza, Albany, New York 12207 (the "Bank" or the "Holder"), or its successors or assigns, the principal sum of TWENTY-NINE MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($29,000,000.00), or so much of said sum as may be advanced hereunder, with interest thereon as set forth below. SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF TERMS. The following words and terms as used in this Note shall have the following meanings unless the context or use indicates another or different meaning or intent: "Adjusted Libor Rate" - Means a rate per annum subject to adjustment approximately each one month equal to the Libor Rate plus one percent (1.00%). "Advance Notice" - the Notice to be delivered by the Company to the Bank in the form of Exhibit "A" attached hereto, which shall serve as a request by the Company that the Bank advance proceeds of the Loan. "Business Day" - In respect of any date that is specified in this Note to be subject to adjustment in accordance with applicable Following Business Day Convention, a day on which commercial banks settle payment in London if the payment obligation is calculated by reference to any Libor Rate. "Default Rate" - A per annum rate of two percent (2%) above the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Note. "Event of Default" - Any of those events defined as an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement. "Following Business Day Convention" - The convention for adjusting any relevant date if it would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day. The term "Business Day", when used in conjunction with the term "Following Business Day Convention" and a date, shall mean that an adjustment will be made if that date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day so that the date will be the first following day that is a Business Day. - 1 -
"Libor Interest Rate Period" - The one month (or slightly longer or shorter) period during which the Adjusted Libor Rate is in effect, provided, however, that in no event shall any Libor Interest Rate Period extend beyond the Maturity Date of this Note. "Libor Rate" - Means the interest rate determined by the following formula (all amounts in the calculation will be determined by the Bank as of the first day of the Libor Interest Rate Period): Libor Rate= London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ------------------------------ (1.00 - Reserve Percentage) "Loan" - The loan of $29,000,000.00 by the Lender to the Company that is the subject of this Note. "Loan Agreement" - Means the loan agreement dated the date hereof by and between the Company and the Bank as such may be amended or supplemented from time to time. "London Inter-Bank Offered Rate" - Means, for any applicable Libor Interest Rate Period, the rate per annum equal to the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate ("BBA LIBOR"), as published by Reuters (or other commercially available source providing quotations of BBA LIBOR as selected by the Bank from time to time) at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time two (2) London Banking Days before the commencement of the applicable Libor Interest Rate Period for U.S. Dollar deposits (for delivery on the first day of such Interest Period) with a term equivalent to such Libor Interest Rate Period. If such rate is not available at such time for any reason, then the rate for that Libor Interest Rate Period will be determined by such alternate method as reasonably selected by the Bank. A "London Banking Day" is a day on which banks in London are open for business and dealing in offshore dollars. "Maturity Date" - March 15, 2010. "Reserve Percentage" - Means the total of the maximum reserve percentages for determining the reserves to be maintained by member banks of the Federal Reserve System for Eurocurrency Liabilities, as defined in the Federal Reserve Board Regulation D, rounded upward to the nearest 1/100 of one percent. The percentage will be expressed as a decimal and will include, but not be limited to, marginal, emergency, supplemental, special and other reserve percentages. All other capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Loan Agreement. SECTION 2. ADVANCES. Advances under this Note shall be reflected on the records of the Bank which said records shall be conclusive absent manifest error. In the absence of an Event of Default or an event which, but for the passage of time, the giving of notice or both would constitute an Event of Default, the Company may request that the Bank advance Loan proceeds. When requesting each advance of Loan proceeds from the - 2 -
Bank, the Company shall deliver to the Bank an Advance Notice setting forth the amount of the advance requested. All advances must be requested prior to 3 p.m. on the date an advance is requested. SECTION 3. INTEREST; PAYMENTS. (A) Subject to the provisions of Section 6 of this Note, commencing on March 15, 2007 and continuing thereafter, interest (calculated on the principal balance hereof and based upon the actual number of days elapsed over a 360 day year) shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Libor Rate. Interest payments shall be payable monthly as set forth in Section 3(B) hereof. In the event the principal balance remains outstanding after the Maturity Date, interest (calculated on the principal balance hereof and based upon the actual number of days elapsed over a 360-day year) shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate. (B) Commencing on April 15, 2007 and continuing on the fifteenth (15th) calendar day of each calendar month thereafter during the term hereof up to but not including the Maturity Date, Borrower shall make monthly payments of accrued interest at the Adjusted Libor Rate together with equal monthly payments of principal in an amount equal to the quotient determined by dividing the amount advanced under this Note as of March 15, 2007 by sixty (60). (C) In the event that any portion of any payment due hereunder is not made within ten (10) days of the date such payment became due, the Company shall pay to the Holder on demand a late payment charge equal to five percent (5%) of the portion of any such payment not paid within such ten (10) day period, provided, however, that such late payment charge shall not exceed $10,000.00 in the aggregate per incident and shall not exceed $10,000.00 in the aggregate upon the maturity or acceleration of the Principal Balance. (D) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, on the Maturity Date, the entire outstanding principal amount hereof and all accumulated, accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable. (E) All payments received pursuant to this Note shall be applied first to the payment of all fees, expenses, and other amounts due to the Holder (excluding principal and interest), then to accrued, accumulated and unpaid interest and the balance in reduction of the Principal Balance hereof, provided that should an Event of Default have occurred and be continuing, payments received hereunder shall be applied at the discretion of the Holder. (F) All payments of interest and principal are to be made for the account of Bank of America, N.A., 69 State Street, Albany, New York 12207 or at such other place as the Holder may direct the Company by written notice. All payments shall be in lawful money of the United States in immediately available funds and are subject to the Following Business Day Convention with respect to date of payment. - 3 -
SECTION 4. PREPAYMENT, MANDATORY REDEMPTION. (A) The Company may upon at least three (3) prior Business Days' notice to the Holder (which notice shall be irrevocable) prepay the Principal Balance and any such prepayment shall occur only on the last day of the Libor Interest Rate Period. Each prepayment whether voluntary, by reason of acceleration or otherwise, will be accompanied by the amount of accrued interest on the amount prepaid and a prepayment fee as described below. A "prepayment" is a payment of an amount on a date earlier than the scheduled payment date for such amounts as required by this Note. The prepayment fee will be the sum of fees calculated separately for each Prepayment Installment, as follows: (i) The Bank will first determine the amount of interest which would have accrued each month for the Prepayment Installment had it remained outstanding until the applicable Original Payment Date using the interest rate applicable to the Prepayment Installment under this Note. (ii) The Bank will then subtract from each monthly interest amount determined in (i) above the amount of interest which would accrue for that Prepayment Installment if it were reinvested from the date of prepayment through the Original Payment Date using the Treasury Rate. (iii) If (i) minus (ii) for the Prepayment Installment is greater than zero, the Bank will discount the monthly differences to the date of prepayment by the Treasury Rate. The Bank will then add together all of the discounted monthly differences for the Prepayment Installment. The following definitions will apply to the calculation of the prepayment fee: (i) "Original Payment Dates" mean the dates on which the prepaid principal would have been paid if there had been no prepayment. If any of the principal would have been paid later than the end of the Libor Interest Rate Period in effect at the time of prepayment, then the Original Payment Date for that amount will be the last day of the Libor Interest Rate Period. (ii) "Prepayment Installment" means the amount of the prepaid principal which would have been paid on a single Original Payment Date. (iii) "Treasury Rate" means the interest rate yield for U.S. Government Treasury Securities which the Bank determines could be obtained by reinvesting a specified Prepayment Installment in such securities from the date of prepayment through the Original Payment Date. The Bank may adjust the Treasury Rate to reflect the compounding, accrual basis or other costs of the prepaid amount. Each of the rates is the Bank's estimate only and the Bank is under no obligation to actually reinvest any prepayment. The rates will be based on information from either the Telerate or Reuters information services, The Wall Street Journal or other information sources the Bank deems appropriate. - 4 -
If by reason of an Event of Default the Bank elects to declare this Note to be immediately due and payable, then any prepayment fee with respect to the resulting prepayment shall become due and payable in the same manner as though the Company had exercised a right of prepayment. SECTION 5. LOAN AGREEMENT. The loan evidenced by this Note is being made pursuant to the terms, provisions and conditions of a certain loan agreement dated the date hereof (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Loan Agreement") by and between the Company and the Holder. SECTION 6. DOCUMENTS. Reference is hereby made to the Loan Agreement and to all amendments and supplements thereto for the provisions, among others, with respect to the nature and extent of the rights, duties and obligations of the Company and the Holder and the terms upon which this Note is or may be secured. SECTION 7. DEFAULT; ACCELERATION. The entire unpaid Principal Balance of this Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest due hereon, may be declared immediately due and payable by the Holder upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an "Event of Default" as defined in the Loan Agreement, provided, however, that from and after the date of any such declaration, the outstanding Principal Balance hereof and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be due and payable, interest shall continue to accrue on the unpaid Principal Balance to the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Default Rate. SECTION 8. COVENANT AGAINST USURY. All agreements between the Company and the Holder are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Holder for the use or the forbearance of the indebtedness evidenced hereby exceed the maximum permissible under applicable law. As used herein, the term "applicable law" shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof, provided, however, that in the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then this Note shall be governed by such law as of its effective date. In this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is the intent of the Company and the Holder in the execution, delivery and acceptance of this Note to contract in strict compliance with the laws of the State of New York from time to time in effect. If, under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof or of any law of the Financing Documents at the time of performance of such provision shall be due shall involve transcending the limit of such validity prescribed by applicable law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limits of such validity and if under or from circumstances whatsoever the Holder should ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest. This provision shall control every other provision of all agreements between the Company and the Guarantors and the Holder. - 5 -
SECTION 9. WAIVER OF DILIGENCE, PRESENTMENT, DEMAND, ETC. The Company hereby waives with respect to this Note: diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of bankruptcy of the Company or any other person or entity liable in respect to this Note, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or any other such Person, protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment of any such liabilities and any other notice and all demands whatsoever except as specifically set forth in this Note or any of the other Financing Documents. SECTION 10. WAIVER, CHANGE, MODIFICATION OR DISCHARGE. The provisions of this Note may not be waived, changed, modified or discharged orally, but only by agreement in writing, signed by the party against whom any enforcement of any waiver, change, modification or discharge is sought. SECTION 11. TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENT OF NOTE; PLEDGE OF RIGHTS; PARTICIPATION. (A) The Holder may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Note and the other Financing Documents to any of the twelve (12) Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341. No such pledge or enforcement thereof shall release the Holder from its obligations under any of the Financing Documents. (B) The Holder shall have the unrestricted right, at any time and from time to time, to grant to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each, a Participant") participating interests in the Holder's obligation to lend hereunder and/or any or all of the loans held by the Holder hereunder. In the event of any such grant by the Holder of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Company, the Holder shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder and the Company shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Holder in connection with the Holder's rights and obligations hereunder. The Holder shall have the unrestricted right at any time or from time to time to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each, an "Assignee") and the Company agrees that it shall execute, or cause to be executed, such documents, including, without limitation, amendments to this Loan Agreement and to the other Financing Documents as the Holder shall deem necessary to effect the foregoing. In addition, at the request of the Holder and any such Assignee, the Company shall issue one or more new promissory notes, as applicable, to any such Assignee and, if the Holder has retained any of its rights and obligations hereunder following such assignment, to the Holder, which new promissory notes shall be issued in replacement of, but not in discharge of, the liability evidenced by the promissory note held by the Holder prior to such assignment and shall reflect the amount of the respective commitments and loans held by such Assignee and the Holder after giving effect to such assignment.

Exhibit 10.5 PROMISSORY NOTE (Revolving Line of Credit) $6,000,000.00 March 16, 2007 Albany, New York FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, BALCHEM CORPORATION, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Maryland and having an address of P.O. Box 600, 52 Sunrise Park Road, New Hampton, New York 10958 (herein called the "Company"), hereby promises to pay to the order of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (successor by merger to Fleet National Bank), a national banking association organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, its successors and assigns (herein called the "Payee" or the "Bank"), at such Payee's office at 69 State Street, Albany, New York 12207, or such other location as the Payee shall designate in writing from time to time, the unpaid amount of all sums that have been advanced to or for the benefit of the Company in accordance with the terms hereof in an amount not to exceed the principal sum of SIX MILLION AND NO\100 DOLLARS ($6,000,000.00), less the face amount of all commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit issued by the Payee at the request of the Borrower during the term hereof, which aggregate face amount of said letters of credit cannot exceed Six Million Dollars ($6,000,000.00) at any one time outstanding, together with interest on the disbursed, unpaid principal or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount due hereunder, together with interest at the rate specified below until paid in full. The records of the Payee maintained in the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the Company's obligations recorded therein. All computations of interest under this Note shall be made on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year and the actual number of days elapsed. DEFINITIONS. As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings: "Adjusted Libor Rate" - Means a rate per annum subject to adjustment approximately each one month equal to the Libor Rate plus one percent (1.00%). "Advance Notice" - The notice to be delivered by the Company to the Bank from time to time in the form of Exhibit "A" attached hereto, which shall serve as a request by the Company that the Bank advance a Loan Portion. "Business Day" - In respect of any date that is specified in the Note to be subject to adjustment in accordance with applicable Following Business Day Convention, a day which commercial banks settle payment in London if the payment obligation is calculated by reference to any Libor Rate. "Default Rate" - A per annum rate of two percent (2%) above the rate of interest otherwise applicable to the Note. - 1 -
"Event of Default" - Any of those events defined as an Event of Default under the Loan Agreement. "Following Business Day Convention" - The convention for adjusting any relevant date if it would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day. The term "Business Day", when used in conjunction with the term "Following Business Day Convention" and a date, shall mean that an adjustment will be made if that date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day so that the date will be the first following day that is a Business Day. "Libor Interest Rate Period" - The one month (or slightly longer or shorter) period during which the Adjusted Libor Rate is in effect provided, however, that in no event shall any Libor Interest Rate Period extend beyond the Maturity Date of this Loan. "Libor Rate" - Means the interest rate determined by the following formula (all amounts in the calculation will be determined by the Bank as of the first day of the Libor Interest Rate Period): Libor Rate= London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ------------------------------ (1.00-Reserve Percentage) "Loan" - The Loan of up to $6,000,000.00 by the Lender to the Company that is the subject of this Note. "Loan Agreement" - Means the loan agreement dated the date hereof by and between the Company and the Bank as such may be amended or supplemented from time to time. "Loan Portion" - Each advance of Loan proceeds by the Bank to the Company, each of which advances will be treated separately for the purposes of computing interest. Each such Loan Portion shall accrue interest at the Adjusted Libor Rate. "London Inter-Bank Offered Rate" - Means, for any applicable Libor Interest Rate Period, the rate per annum equal to the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate ("BBA LIBOR"), as published by Reuters (or other commercially available source providing quotations of BBA LIBOR as selected by the Bank from time to time) at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time two (2) London Banking Days before the commencement of the applicable Libor Interest Rate Period, for U.S. Dollar deposits (for delivery on the first day of such Interest Period) with a term equivalent to such Libor Interest Rate Period. If such rate is not available at such time for any reason, then the rate for that Libor Interest Rate Period will be determined by such alternate method as reasonably selected by the Bank. A "London Banking Day" is a day on which banks in London are open for business and dealing in offshore dollars. "Maturity Date" - May 31, 2009. - 2 -
"Prime Rate" - Means the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by the Bank as its Prime Rate. The Prime Rate is set by the Bank based on various factors, including the Bank's costs and desired return, general economic conditions and other factors and is used as a reference point for pricing some loans. The Bank may price loans to its customers at, above or below the Prime Rate. Any change in the Prime Rate shall take effect at the opening of business on the day specified in the public announcement of a change in the Bank's Prime Rate. "Reserve Percentage" - Means the total of the maximum reserve percentages for determining the reserves to be maintained by member banks of the Federal Reserve System for Eurocurrency Liabilities, as defined in the Federal Reserve Board Regulation D, rounded upward to the nearest 1/100 of one percent. The percentage will be expressed as a decimal and will include, but not be limited to, marginal, emergency, supplemental, special and other reserve percentages. ADVANCES. Advances under this Note shall be reflected on the records of the Payee which said records shall be conclusive absent manifest error. In the absence of an Event of Default or an event which, but for the passage of time, the giving of notice or both would constitute an Event of Default, as the Company makes repayments of principal, it shall be permitted to re-borrow hereunder until the Maturity Date. When requesting each advance of Loan proceeds from the Bank, the Company shall deliver to the Bank an Advance Notice setting forth the amount of the Loan Portion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Bank shall not be obligated to honor an Advance Notice in the event either (i) dollar deposits in the principal amount requested, and for the periods equal to the applicable Libor Interest Rate Period selected, are not available in the London inter-bank market or (ii) the Libor Rate does not accurately reflect the cost of said requested principal amount, in which event the interest rate shall be determined by the Bank based upon a comparable Prime Rate based rate of interest until such time as said conditions no longer exist. PAYMENTS. In the event the entire amount of any payment due hereunder is not paid within ten (10) days after the same is due, a late fee equal to five percent (5%) of the required payment will be charged by the Payee provided, however, that such late fee shall not exceed $10,000.00 in the aggregate per incident and shall not exceed $10,000.00 in the aggregate upon the maturity or acceleration of the principal balance. Accrued interest shall be payable on the first day of the month immediately succeeding the date of this Note and on the first day of each succeeding month thereafter during the term of this Note and all disbursed unpaid principal together with accrued interest will be paid in full no later than the Maturity Date. All payments shall be applied first to the payment of all fees, expenses and other amounts due to the Payee (excluding principal and interest), then to accrued interest and the balance on account of outstanding principal; provided, however that after the occurrence of an Event of Default, payments will be applied to the obligations of the Company to the Payee as the Payee determines in its sole discretion. All payments shall be in lawful money of the United States in - 3 -
immediately available funds, without counterclaim or setoff and free and clear of and without any deduction or withholding for, any taxes or other payments and are subject to the Following Business Day Convention with respect to date of payment. PREPAYMENT. The Company may prepay a Loan Portion only upon at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Bank (which notice shall be irrevocable), and any such prepayment shall occur only on the last day of the Libor Interest Rate Period. Each prepayment of a Loan Portion, whether voluntary, by reason of acceleration or otherwise, will be accompanied by the amount of accrued interest on the amount prepaid and a prepayment fee as described below. A "prepayment" is a payment of an amount on a date earlier than the scheduled payment date for such amounts as required by this Note. The prepayment fee will be the sum of fees calculated separately for each Prepayment Installment, as follows: (i) The Bank will first determine the amount of interest which would have accrued each month for the Prepayment Installment had it remained outstanding until the applicable Original Payment Date, using the interest rate applicable to the Prepayment Installment under this Note. (ii) The Bank will then subtract, from each monthly interest amount determined in (i) above, the amount of interest which would accrue for that Prepayment Installment if it were reinvested from the date of prepayment through the Original Payment Date, using the Treasury Rate. (iii) If (i) minus (ii) for the Prepayment Installment is greater than zero, the Bank will discount the monthly differences to the date of prepayment by the Treasury Rate. The Bank will then add together all of the discounted monthly differences for the Prepayment Installment. The following definitions will apply to the calculation of the prepayment fee: (i) "Original Payment Dates" mean the dates on which the prepaid principal would have been paid if there had been no prepayment. If any of the principal would have been paid later than the end of the Libor Interest Rate Period in effect at the time of prepayment, then the Original Payment Date for that amount will be the last day of the Libor Interest Rate Period. (ii) "Prepayment Installment" means the amount of the prepaid principal which would have been paid on a single Original Payment Date. (iii) "Treasury Rate" means the interest rate yield for U.S. Government Treasury Securities which the Bank determines could be obtained by reinvesting a specified Prepayment Installment in such securities from the date of prepayment through the Original Payment Date. The Bank may adjust the Treasury Rate to reflect the compounding, accrual basis or other costs of the prepaid amount. Each of the rates is the Bank's estimate only and the Bank is under no obligation to - 4 -
actually reinvest any prepayment. The rates will be based on information from either the Telerate or Reuters information services, The Wall Street Journal or other information sources the Bank deems appropriate. If by reason of an Event of Default the Bank elects to declare this Note to be immediately due and payable, then any prepayment fee with respect to the resulting prepayment shall become due and payable in the same manner as though the Company had exercised a right of prepayment. LETTERS OF CREDIT. All commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit issued hereunder shall be issued pursuant to the standard documentation provided by the Bank and shall be subject to the payment of an annual commission equal to one percent (1.00%) of the face amount of all standby letters of credit and one quarter of one percent (.25%) of the amount drawn on all commercial letters of credit, so issued and outstanding, such commission to be due and payable in advance at issuance and on each subsequent annual anniversary of the issuance of any outstanding standby letter of credit and at the time of each drawing on a commercial letter of credit. Any outstanding commercial letters of credit issued pursuant to the terms hereof shall expire no later than 180 days following the Maturity Date and any outstanding standby letter of credit issued pursuant to the terms hereof shall expire no later than 365 days following: (a) the issuance date of such standby letter of credit and (b) the Maturity Date. The Company shall also be responsible for paying the Bank's standard issuance, amendment, transfer and other fees associated with the issuance of letters of credit. DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of one or more Events of Default under the Loan Agreement, the entire principal and interest on this Note shall become immediately due and payable without presentment or protest or other notice of demand, all of which are expressly waived by the Company. If the Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects not to demand payment by the Company, notwithstanding said failure to demand, the Bank shall be under no obligation to make advances pursuant to the terms of this Note unless and until the Event of Default is cured to the satisfaction of the Bank. If an Event of Default should occur and be continuing on or after the Maturity Date or after judgment has been rendered on this Note, all Loan Portions shall bear interest at the Default Rate until the earlier of (i) the Event of Default is cured or (ii) all Loan Portions are paid in full. The powers and remedies given hereby shall not be exclusive of any other powers and remedies available to the Payee. No course of dealings between the Company and the Payee and no delay on the part of the Payee in exercising any rights with respect to any default shall operate as a waiver of any rights of the Payee. Failure upon the part of the Payee to exercise any rights with respect to any default shall not operate as a waiver of any rights with respect to any other default. Interest after maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) shall be payable at the Default Rate set forth herein until this Note is paid in full. - 5 -
PARTIAL INVALIDITY. If any provision of this Note or the application of it to any person or circumstance shall be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Note or the application of that provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected and every other provision of this Note shall be valid and fully enforceable. WAIVER, CHANGE, MODIFICATION OR DISCHARGE. This Note may not be waived, changed, modified or discharged orally, but only by agreement in writing signed by the party against whom any enforcement of any waiver, change, modification or discharge is sought. COVENANT AGAINST USURY. All agreements between the Company and the Bank are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of maturity of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Bank for the use or the forbearance of the indebtedness evidenced hereby exceed the maximum permissible under applicable law. As used herein, the term "applicable law" shall mean the law in effect as of the date hereof, provided, however, that in the event there is a change in the law which results in a higher permissible rate of interest, then this Note shall be governed by such law as of its effective date. In this regard, it is expressly agreed that it is the intent of the Company and the Bank in the execution, delivery and acceptance of this Note to contract in strict compliance with the laws of the State of New York from time to time in effect. If, under or from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision hereof at the time of performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of such validity prescribed by applicable law, then the obligation to be fulfilled shall automatically be reduced to the limits of such validity, and if under or from circumstances whatsoever the Bank should ever receive as interest an amount which would exceed the highest lawful rate, such amount which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance evidenced hereby and not to the payment of interest. This provision shall control every other provision of all agreements between the Company and the Bank. WAIVER OF DILIGENCE, PRESENTMENT, DEMAND, ETC. The Company hereby waives with respect to this Note: diligence, presentment, demand for payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of bankruptcy of the Company or any other person or entity liable in respect to this Note, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company or any other such person, protest, notice of dishonor or nonpayment of any such liabilities and any other notice and all demands whatsoever except as specifically set forth in this Note. TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENT OF NOTE; PLEDGE OF RIGHTS; PARTICIPATION. (A) The Bank may at any time pledge all or any portion of its rights under this Note to any of the twelve (12) Federal Reserve Banks organized under Section 4 of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 341. No such pledge or enforcement thereof shall release the Bank from its obligations hereunder. - 6 -
(B) The Bank shall have the unrestricted right, at any time and from time to time, and without the consent of or notice to the Company, to grant to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each, a "Participant") participating interests in the Bank's obligation to lend hereunder and/or any or all of the loans held by the Bank hereunder. In the event of any such grant by the Bank of a participating interest to a Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Company, the Bank shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations hereunder and the Company shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Bank in connection with the Bank's rights and obligations hereunder. The Bank shall have the unrestricted right, at any time or from time to time, to assign all or any portion of its rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Financing Documents to one or more banks or other financial institutions (each, an "Assignee") and the Company agrees that it shall execute, or cause to be executed, such documents, including without limitation, amendments to this Note and to the other Financing Documents as the Bank shall deem necessary to effect the foregoing. In addition, at the request of the Bank and any such Assignee, the Company shall issue one or more new promissory notes, as applicable, to any such Assignee and, if the Bank has retained any of its rights and obligations hereunder following such assignment, to the Bank, which new promissory notes shall be issued in replacement of, but not in discharge of, the liability evidenced by the promissory note held by the Bank prior to such assignment and shall reflect the amount of the respective commitments and loans held by such Assignee and the Bank after giving effect to such assignment. Upon the execution and delivery of appropriate assignment documentation, amendments and any other documentation required by the Bank in connection with such assignment, and the payment by Assignee of the purchase price agreed to by the Bank and such Assignee, such Assignee shall be a party to this Note and shall have all of the rights and obligations of the Bank hereunder and under the other Financing Documents to the extent that such rights and obligations have been assigned by the Bank pursuant hereto and to the assignment documentation between the Bank and such Assignee and the Bank shall be released from its obligations hereunder and thereunder to a corresponding extent. Provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and except with respect to an assignment or transfer of the Loans mandated by a Governmental Authority, the Company shall have the right to approve the identity of any Participant or Assignee under this subsection (B), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. Except as aforesaid, the right of the Bank to assign or grant a participation interest shall not require notice to or consent of the Company. The Bank may furnish any information concerning the Company in its possession from time to time to prospective Assignees and Participants, provided that the Bank shall require any such prospective Assignee or Participant to agree in writing for the benefit of the Company to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

In connection, the Company will assume liabilities certain relating to the business prior to the closing, including the payables and unpaid employee entitlements. In addition, employment of all of Akzo's current employees located at its Marano Ticino facility will be transferred to the Company. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Company will offer to employ Akzo's sales staff (currently employed by affiliates of Akzo). The Purchase Agreement contains, among other things, customary representations and warranties of the parties, customary indemnities, and other customary provisions, including an agreement of Akzo to conduct the business only in the ordinary course until the closing.

Methylamines are used as raw materials for the production of choline chloride and also widely used in many chemical and industrial applications. The parties estimate the transaction will close within the next thirty to sixty days after satisfaction of customary conditions contained in the agreement.

Independent Auditors' Report ---------------------------- The Shareholders of Chinook Global Limited We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Chinook Global Limited as of December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statement of earnings, stockholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for the twelve month period then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Chinook Global Limited as of December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the twelve month period then ended in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (1) Summary of significant accounting policies: (a) Basis of presentation Chinook Group Limited, amalgamated with Chinook Canada Limited on February 1, 2005 to form Chinook Global Limited ("CGL"). While the Company's fiscal period ends on March 31st, these financial statements have been prepared as at and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. On April 6, 2006, new investors, being members of management ("new investors") acquired 95.6% of the Company not previously held by management representing all the issued and outstanding Class A common stock of the Company. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141 "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets". Under the purchase method of accounting, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition and these values were "pushed down" to the Company's financial statements in accordance with push down accounting rules. As a result of the acquisition, both the operating results of the Company prior to April 7, 2006 and the operating results post April 6, 2006 are presented in these financial statements. (b) Description of business Chinook Global Limited is engaged in the business of producing and selling choline chloride and specialty choline derivatives throughout the world. Choline chloride is a vitamin B4 feed supplement that is broadly used primarily in the swine, poultry and pet food industry. (c) Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Chinook Global Limited and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In addition, the Company evaluates its relationships with other entities to identify whether they are variable interest entities as defined by FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46R") and to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of such entities. If the determination is made that the Company is the primary beneficiary, then that entity is included in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with FIN 46(R). The Company has no relationships with variable interest entities. 6
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (1) Summary of significant accounting policies (continued): (d) Trade accounts receivable Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses for doubtful accounts in the Company's existing accounts receivable. The Company determines the allowance based on an individual account by account review of all accounts outstanding at the balance sheet date. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers. (e) Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined using the weighted average method and net realizable value. (f) Property, plant, and equipment Land is stated at cost. Buildings and equipment are stated at amortized cost. Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Asset Rate ----- ---- Buildings, roads and sidings 25 years Production equipment 15-20 years Pollution control equipment 10 years Furniture and fixtures 5 years (g) Income taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 7
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (1) Summary of significant accounting policies (continued): (h) Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss, collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. Volume discounts earned by customers are applied to invoices at the time of invoicing and are accounted for as a reduction of revenues. Given the nature of the products sold, the Company does not allow customers product returns or allowances unless the product does not meet pre-established product specification. Early payment discounts are given to select customers only. (i) Derivative instruments The Company accounts for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging activities, as amended, which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values. Accordingly, each derivative contract is adjusted to fair value at the balance sheet date with changes in fair value being recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on quoted market values or cash flow analyses. The recorded amounts of financial instruments in these consolidated financial statements approximate their fair values. (j) Impairment of long-lived assets In accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for Impairment on Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, property, plant, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet. 8
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (1) Summary of significant accounting policies (continued): (k) Asset retirement obligation In accordance with FASB Statement No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, ("Statement 143") the Company recognizes the fair value of a future asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets or leased assets that results from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or normal use of the assets. The Company concurrently recognizes a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset that is amortized over the life of the asset. The fair value of the asset retirement obligation is estimated using the expected cash flow approach that reflects a range of possible outcomes discounted at a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Subsequent to the initial measurement, the asset retirement obligation is adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation. Changes in the obligation due to the passage of time are recognized in interest, net expense using the interest method. Changes in the obligation due to changes in estimated cash flows are recognized as an adjustment of the carrying amount or value of the related long-lived asset that is amortized over the remaining life of the asset. (l) Commitments and contingencies Liabilities for loss contingencies, including environmental remediation costs not within the scope of Statement 143, arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from third parties, which are probable of realization, are separately recorded as assets, and are not offset against the related environmental liability, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. The Company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations not within the scope of Statement 143 when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. Costs of future expenditures for environment remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. 9
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (1) Summary of significant accounting policies (continued): (m) Foreign currency translation Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Realized and unrealized exchange gains and losses are included in earnings. (n) Accounting for foreign currencies The functional currency of the Company is the United States dollar. All transactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated using an estimated rate on the day the transaction occurs. The Company's functional currency changed to the United States dollar effective April 1, 2003. At this time the financial statements were remeasured into United States dollars using the historical exchange rate for property, plant and equipment, equity and certain other non-monetary assets and liabilities and related amortization on these assets and liabilities. The Company used the exchange rate at the balance sheet date for the remaining monetary assets and liabilities. A weighted average exchange rate was used for each prior year revenues and expenses. Translation adjustments, which were based upon the exchange rate at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities and the weighted average rate for prior year income statements, are recorded as cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive loss in Stockholders' equity. (o) Use of estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, the railcar retirement obligation, valuation allowances for receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets, environmental liabilities and valuation of derivative instruments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 10
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (2) Acquisition: On April 6, 2006 new investors being members of management ("new investors"), acquired the 95.6% of the Company representing all of the issued and outstanding Class A common stock of the Company for total consideration of $1.00, from the prior stockholders. The acquisition by Management has been accounted for by the purchase method, whereby the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value. The allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their assigned values is as follows: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,598 Accounts receivable 4,918 Inventories 2,832 Property, plant and equipment, available for sale 128 Unrealized gain on derivative contract 308 Other current assets 500 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total assets acquired 10,284 Trade accounts payable 3,973 Accrued liabilities 1,638 Fines payable 1,234 Railcar retirement obligation 111 Notes payable 1,644 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total liabilities assumed 8,600 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Net assets acquired 1,684 Cash consideration 1.00 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Extraordinary gain $ 1,684 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired was $29,298. The fair value of liabilities assumed was $8,600 resulting in negative goodwill of $20,698. Negative goodwill was allocated to the acquired assets on a pro-rata basis in accordance with SFAS 141, "Business Combinations". As a result of the allocation, all property, plant and equipment acquired, other than that held for sale and intangible assets were reduced to nil. Following the allocation, $1,684 of negative goodwill remained and was recorded as an extraordinary gain. 11
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (3) Derivative instruments: The Company uses commodity derivatives to manage its exposure to commodity price fluctuations. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company owes the counterparty and, therefore, it does not possess credit risk. The Company minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a derivative instrument that results from a change in commodity prices. The market risk associated with commodity-price contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. The Company maintains a commodity-price-risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity-price volatility. The manufacturing of the Company's products requires a significant volume of raw materials. Price fluctuations of raw materials cause market values of raw material inventory to differ from its cost and for the actual purchase price of raw materials to differ from the contract price. The Company has the following derivative instruments at December 31, 2006: (a) On May 5, 2006, the Company entered into a natural gas swap agreement. The swap expires on March 31, 2007 and requires the Company to pay (or receive from) a counterparty on a monthly basis the difference between prevailing market rates and the contract price. The prevailing market price at December 31, 2006 was lower than the contract price. (b) On December 15, 2006, the Company entered into a contract to purchase a raw material and to fix the price of the material. The contract expires in January 2007 and requires the Company to take delivery of the contracted amount of the raw material. The prevailing market forward price at December 31, 2006 is in excess of the contract price. (c) At December 31, 2006, the Company had an obligation to deliver a raw material input to a supplier based on the amount of processed materials already received from the supplier. The fair value of the obligation to deliver the raw material component has been determined using the spot price of the raw material component at December 31, 2006, which exceeds the contract price. 12
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (3) Derivative instruments (continued): The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's derivative instruments at December 31, 2006 (asset/(liability)): Carrying and fair value Natural gas swap agreement (a) $ (249) Raw material purchase contract (b) 492 Process material purchase contract (c) (103) (4) Property, plant and equipment: Buildings, roads and sidings $ -- Production equipment 524 Pollution control equipment -- Furniture and fixtures -- Less accumulated amortization 39 --------- 485 Assets held for sale 128 --------- $ 613 ========= The carrying value of all property, plant and equipment, other than property held for sale, was reduced to nil as a result of the acquisition (note 2). (5) Railcar retirement obligation: The Company has a railcar retirement obligation arising from requirements to perform certain activities at the time that certain leased equipment is returned to the lessor. The liability was initially measured at fair value and subsequently is adjusted for accretion expense and changes in the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows. The corresponding retirement costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the lease. The following table presents the activity for the railcar retirement obligation for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2006: January 1, April 7, to April 6 to December 31 Beginning balance $ 110 $ 111 Additional liabilities incurred -- -- Liabilities settled in current period -- -- Revisions to estimates -- -- Accretion expense 1 4 ------------ ------------ Ending balance $ 111 $ 115 ============ ============ 13
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (6) Fines payable: Fines payable at December 31, 2006 consists of the following (note 14(a)): Unsecured non-interest bearing amounts, payable in equal quarterly installments of $120, due June 2009 $ 1,180 Less amounts representing interest at 7% 184 ------------ 996 Less current installments 480 ------------ Fines payable $ 516 ============ (7) Income taxes: Income tax expense attributable to income from continuing operations was nil for the 96-day period ended April 6, 2006 and the 269-day period ended December 31, 2006, and differed from the amounts computed by applying the Canadian Federal income tax rate of 22.12% and Ontario Provincial tax rate of 14% to pretax income from continuing operations as a result of the following: The Company is not subject to income taxes in any foreign jurisdiction. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2006 are presented below. Deferred tax assets: Non-capital losses carried forward $ 4,201 Equipment and machinery 1,208 Other 175 ------- Total gross deferred tax assets 5,584 Less valuation allowance (5,584) ------- Net deferred tax assets $ -- ======= 14
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (7) Income taxes (continued): In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. In order to fully realize the deferred tax asset, the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately $12,312 prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carry forwards and investment tax credit carry forwards as follows: Investment Loss tax credits carry forwards ----------- -------------- 2010 $ 47 $ -- 2011 13 1,191 2012 11 -- 2013 16 -- 2015 -- 7,820 2016 -- 3,301 ------------ ------------ $ 87 $ 12,312 ============ ============ Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences at December 31, 2006. Subsequent to year end, the Company sold certain of its assets (note 17(b)). The future tax asset attributed to loss carry forwards previously reduced to nil, through the recognition of a valuation allowance, will by utilized by the Company as a result of the sale. 15

On December 1, 2006, the Company redeemed the notes for total consideration of $1,407. The $237 benefit recognized by the Company, being the amount by which the redemption amount was less than the stated principal outstanding has been recorded as additional paid in capital. (10) Related party transaction: During the period ended April 6, 2006, the Company repaid a $500 obligation under a revolving credit facility bearing interest at bank prime rate to a company under common control.

On January 15, 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas restructured the fine payment schedule to require payments in quarterly instalments of $120 with the final instalment due in June 2009 (note 5). In addition, all of the predecessor companies (collectively referred to as the "Chinook defendants") were named as co-defendants in numerous class action and non-class civil action suits as a result of the charges brought by the DOJ. As of December 31, 2006, virtually all class action and non-class civil action suits which had been filed against one or more of the Chinook defendants, except as noted below, have been settled and no further amounts are owed by CGL in respect of these actions. CGL reached an agreement in principle on March 1, 2005, subject to review and execution of the necessary legal documentation, to settle the Straus and Boies Actions. The agreement in principle contemplated a payment by CGL of approximately $200, and accordingly, this amount has been recorded as a liability at December 31, 2006. However, as at December 31, 2006, the Straus & Boies Actions, an amalgamation of numerous state indirect purchases class action suits, remains unsettled and management is not in a position at this time to suggest a date when the above noted matter will be fully resolved. Legal fees to represent the Company in these matters are expensed as incurred. (b) The Company entered into a Participation Agreement with a former shareholder pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay 50% of the net proceeds realized from the sale of certain property, plant and equipment assets of the Company, if any, less one third of the aggregate amount of fines and surcharges in excess of $50 that may be required to be paid by the Company in relation to claims brought against the Company by the Ministry for the Environment for the Province of Ontario ("MOE") for violations alleged to have occurred in 2004 and 2005 (see Note 17(b)). "Net proceeds" is defined in the Participation Agreement to be sale proceeds less out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company in respect of the sale of the assets, including commissions, legal fees and decommissioning costs of buildings and/or equipment required to facilitate sale. The former shareholder is not obligated to make any payments under the Participation Agreement. At this time, the Company has not actively pursued the sale of the assets which are subject to the Participation Agreement. 21
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (15) Business and credit concentrations: i) Credit risk: Credit risk arises from the potential default of a customer in meeting its financial obligation to the Company. The Company has credit evaluation, approval and monitoring processes to mitigate potential credit risk. The Company evaluated the collectability of accounts receivable and no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered necessary. ii) Business concentration: The Company supplies products to a broad range of customers who operate in a number of industry segments. No single customer, identifiable group of customers or business segment comprises a substantial portion of the Company's sales. As such, the Company is not subjected to undue business concentration risk. (16) Segmented information: The following schedules provide required segmented information disclosure for the period ended: January 1, 2006 to April 6, 2006: United Canada States International Total ------------------------------------------------- Net sales $ 1,356 $ 7,386 $ 2,048 $ 10,790 Property, plant and equipment 3,733 -- -- 3,733 April 7, 2006 to December 31, 2006: United Canada States International Total ------------------------------------------------- Net sales $ 5,610 $ 20,934 $ 5,803 $ 32,347 Property, plant and equipment 613 -- -- 613 Geographic segmentation of revenue is determined based on the location of the customer. 22
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (17) Subsequent events: (a) Indirect California Actions: A predecessor company of CGL pleaded guilty on January 24, 2000, to felony price fixing in the United States. This matter was resolved with the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") with the imposition of a non-interest bearing fine of $5,000, initially payable in escalating annual instalments over a five year period. On January 15, 2004, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas restructured the fine payment schedule to require payments in quarterly instalments of $120 with the final instalment due in June 2009 (note 5). In addition, all of the predecessor companies (collectively referred to as the "Chinook defendants") were named as co-defendants in numerous class action and non-class civil action suits as a result of the charges brought by the DOJ. As of December 31, 2006, virtually all class action and non-class civil action suits which had been filed against one or more of the Chinook defendants, except as noted below, have been settled and no further amounts are owed by CGL in respect of these actions. On February 28, 2007, the Company signed a Memorandum Agreement to settle the Indirect California Actions for $275. As the financial statements as at and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 had not been issued at the time of the settlement, they were adjusted for the resolution of this matter and therefore the settlement had no effect on the results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006. Accordingly, a liability of $275 has been recorded in these financial statements. (b) Sale of assets: On March 16, 2007, the Company sold its inventory and customer list to a publicly listed company in the United States. (c) Ministry of the Environment for the Province of Ontario: On September 28, 2006 CGL was charged with two counts of failing to comply, in October of 2004, with an amended Certificate of Approval for Air contrary to Section 186(3) of the Environmental Protection Act for the Province of Ontario and on September 29, 2006 CGL was charged with one count of failing to comply, in October of 2004, with the daily loading limit for a regulated element contrary to Section 186(1) of the Environmental Protection Act. The MOE has identified that there are a number of charges beyond the above noted charges which could be laid and which pertain to failing to comply with the daily loading limit for various dates in July 2005 and for failing to report same on one occasion contrary to the Environmental Protection Act. The MOE has indicated that there will be a financial penalty assessed. 23
CHINOOK GLOBAL LIMITED Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2006 (US $ in thousands) (17) Subsequent events (continued): (c) Ministry of the Environment for the Province of Ontario (continued): On May 4, 2007, the Company reached an agreement to settle the outstanding charges laid by the MOE in September, 2006. The Company agreed to a settlement amount of $815. As the Company had previously recorded a liability for this amount, no adjustment to the financial statements was made as a result of the settlement. 24
Item 9.01(b) Pro Forma Financial Information 1. Description of Transaction and Basis of Presentation On March 16, 2007, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary BCP Ingredients, Inc. ("BCP"), entered into an asset purchase agreement (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with Chinook Global Limited ("Chinook"), a privately held Ontario corporation, pursuant to which BCP acquired certain of Chinook's choline chloride business assets (the "Chinook Acquisition") for a purchase price of $29,000,000 plus the value of certain product inventories estimated at approximately $1,840,000. The acquisition closed effective the same date. On March 16, 2007, the Company and its principal bank entered into a new Loan Agreement (the "New Loan Agreement") providing for an unsecured term loan of $29,000,000 (the "New Term Loan"), the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisition. The New Term Loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal, each equal to 1/60th of the principal of the New Term Loan, together with accrued interest, with remaining principal and interest payable at maturity. The New Term Loan has a maturity date of March 16, 2010 and is subject to a monthly interest rate equal to LIBOR plus 1%. At March 31, 2007, this interest rate was 6.32%. Because these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared based on preliminary estimates of fair values attributable to the acquisition, the actual amounts recorded for the acquisition may differ from the information presented in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The Chinook Acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price of the acquisition has been assigned to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of such assets at the date of acquisition. The pro forma information presented is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have been achieved if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of each period, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any operating efficiencies and cost savings that we may achieve with respect to the acquisition. The pro forma information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes thereto, and in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Balchem Corporation's annual reports on Form 10-K. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
2. Purchase Price Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation The preliminary allocation of the total purchase price, including acquisition costs, was based on the estimated fair values as of March 16, 2007. Adjustments to these estimates will be included in the allocation of the purchase price of the Chinook Acquisition upon settlement of any working capital or other adjustments. The preliminary purchase price has been allocated as follows (in thousands): - ---------------------------------------------------- Fair Value Recorded in Purchase Accounting - ---------------------------------------------------- Customer list $ 29,201 Inventory 1,840 Short-term receivable 1,850 Short-term obligation (870) Other 73 - ---------------------------------------------------- Total $ 32,094 ====================================================
Balchem Corporation Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements (in thousands) Balance Sheet: 1) Represents the Company's historical consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. 2) Represents Chinook's historical consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. The pro forma combined financial statements have been adjusted for the items set forth below: 3) To record cash paid as if the acquisition took place on December 31, 2006 of $29,274 which includes $201 and $73 for acquisition costs and deferred financing costs respectively, incurred in connection with borrowings pursuant to the $29,000 term loan used to finance the acquisition. 4) The following reflects the preliminary allocation of the purchase price. These allocations may change based on actual working capital and other adjustments. ---------------------------------------------------- Fair Value Recorded in Purchase Accounting ---------------------------------------------------- Customer list $ 29,201 Inventory 1,840 Short-term receivable 1,850 Short-term obligation (870) Other 73 ---------------------------------------------------- Total $ 32,094 ==================================================== 5) Reflects the deferred financing charges incurred in connection with borrowings pursuant to the $29,000 term loan used to finance the acquisition. Such costs will be amortized over 3 years, the term of the related debt. 6) To record borrowings pursuant to the term loan of $29,000 to fund the acquisition of the Chinook Acquisition. The Term Loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal totaling approximately $483, together with accrued interest, and has a maturity date of March 16, 2010. Borrowing under the term loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1%. 7) To eliminate the historical assets, liabilities, and equity of Chinook.
Balchem Corporation Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements (in thousands) Statement of Operations: 8) Represents the Company's historical consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2006. 9) Represents Chinook's historical consolidated statement of earnings for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2006. 10) Adjustment to decrease depreciation expense included in cost of sales by $128 to reflect the preliminary allocation of the purchase price which did not include acquired property, plant and equipment. 11) Adjustment of $2,920 to reflect amortization expense of the customer list acquired for the year ended December 31, 2006. The Company amortizes its customer lists over 10 years. Also reflects the elimination of selling, general and administrative expenses that were not acquired. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as of January 1, 2002. These standards require the use of the purchase method of business combination and define an intangible asset. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. 12) Adjustment to reflect the Company's pro forma interest expense associated with additional borrowings for the acquisitions. Interest is calculated on the $29,000 Term Loan (variable rate assumed at 6.32%) resulting in interest expense of approximately $1,650 for the year ended December 31, 2006. The effects of a 1/8% increase or decrease in interest rates would change annual interest expense by approximately $19. 13) Elimination of fines, currency losses and derivative gains and losses. 14) Adjustment to apply the Company's effective tax rate of 35.7% to the pretax earnings/(loss) of the pro forma adjustments and to the earnings/(loss) of Chinook. The effective tax rate used by the Company is higher than applicable statutory rates due to the inclusion of state income taxes.

Exhibit 99.1 Balchem Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2007 Results --------------------------------------------------------- New Hampton, NY - August 1, 2007 BALCHEM CORPORATION (NASDAQ: BCPC) reported as follows (unaudited) for the period ended June 30, 2007 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) All per share information has been adjusted to reflect the three for two stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock dividend declared on December 15, 2006. For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2007 2006 -------- -------- Net sales $ 44,371 $ 25,100 Gross profit 12,182 8,800 Operating expenses 5,393 3,930 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 6,789 4,870 Other income (expense) (422) (57) -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 6,367 4,813 Income tax expense 2,302 1,758 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 4,065 $ 3,055 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.23 $ 0.18 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.22 $ 0.17 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 18,579 18,242 For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2007 2006 -------- -------- Net sales $ 71,970 $ 49,697 Gross profit 21,923 17,022 Operating expenses 9,792 7,683 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 12,131 9,339 Other income (expense) (450) (81) -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 11,681 9,258 Income tax expense 4,175 3,345 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 7,506 $ 5,913 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.42 $ 0.34 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.41 $ 0.32 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 18,487 18,238
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 New Record Quarter Results for Net Sales and Net Earnings Record net sales of $44.4 million were achieved for the quarter ended ---------------- June 30, 2007. This is an increase of 76.8% above the $25.1 million result of the prior year comparable quarter and was derived from both organic and acquisition growth. Record net earnings for the quarter were $4.1 million, an ------------------- increase of $1.0 million, or 33.1% as compared with the same period last year. The $4.1 million in net earnings resulted in an increase in diluted net earnings of 29.4% to $0.22 per share for the second quarter of 2007 versus $0.17 per share for the comparable quarter of the prior year. In the second quarter of 2007, the BCP Ingredients segment achieved record quarterly sales of $24.3 million. This result reflects sales from the customer list acquisition of Chinook Group Limited ("Chinook"), completed earlier in 2007, as well as sales from the acquisition of Akzo Nobel Chemicals S.p.A. ("Akzo"), completed in May 2007. The Chinook and Akzo acquisitions contributed approximately $9.5 million and $6.7 million of the revenue increase in this segment, respectively. The overall increase in sales volume and product mix drove positive earnings from operations for this segment, improving to $2.5 million, as compared to $1.1 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This segment earnings result also includes non-cash amortization expense of $0.7 million derived from the Chinook acquisition. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $11.7 million, an increase of 11.5% from the prior year comparable quarter. This result was driven principally by increased global sales of human nutritional and choline products, and includes $0.3 million from the Akzo acquisition. Continued strong sales of REASHURE(R) and Niashure, our specialty animal nutrition and health products targeted for ruminant animals, and increases in the companion animal market also contributed to this double digit growth. Segment results were partially offset by continued slowness in sales of calcium products into the over-the-counter pharmaceutical markets. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 19.7% to $1.2 million, as compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of $3.1 million on record quarterly sales of $8.4 million. Earnings from operations for this segment were 10.4% higher than the prior year quarter, due to a 4.5% increase in sales, principally from increased volumes of ethylene oxide products. Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was $12.2 million, or an increase of 38.4% compared to $8.8 million for the prior year comparable period, largely due to the above-noted increase in sales. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 37% to $5.4 million, as compared to $3.9 million for the prior year comparable quarter, equaling 12.2% of net sales down from 15.7% in the prior year quarter. This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to additional amortization and selling expenses associated with the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, net sales have increased 44.8% to $72.0 million compared to $49.7 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings increased 26.9% to $7.5 million or $0.41 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $5.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share in the prior year comparable period. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Late in the first quarter of 2007, we borrowed $29 million, the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the Chinook acquisition. In May, 2007, we borrowed an additional $10 million to complete the funding of the Akzo acquisition.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 Outlook Commenting on 2007, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem, said "We are busy integrating the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. While this second quarter result does not reflect all of the synergies that we expect for our choline platforms, we have made significant progress. We have transitioned the acquired customer base with no disruptions, and early on, we are quite pleased with the businesses acquired, as they have contributed accretively to our earnings this quarter. We have broadened our technology base into manufacturing of methylamines and derivatives as well as additional choline technologies and end markets. We expect the results of our calcium products for the pharmaceutical and OTC markets to improve beginning in the third quarter, supporting our expectation of strong double digit growth in both sales and earnings for the balance of the year." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be held on Wednesday, August 1, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review second quarter 2007 results. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, Chief Financial Officer, will host the call.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 New Record Quarter Results for Sales and Earnings Record net sales of $50.5 million were achieved for the quarter ended ---------------- September 30, 2007. This is an increase of 101% above the $25.1 million result of the prior year comparable quarter and was derived from both organic and acquisition growth. Record net earnings for the quarter were $4.5 million, an ------------------- increase of $1.3 million, or 41.4% as compared with the same period last year. The $4.5 million in net earnings resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of 41.2%, or $0.24 per share for the third quarter of 2007 versus $0.17 per share for the prior year comparable quarter. Detailing the third quarter of 2007, the BCP Ingredients segment achieved record quarterly sales of $29.4 million. This result reflects sales derived from the acquisitions of the customer list of Chinook Group Limited ("Chinook") and certain assets of Akzo Nobel Chemicals S.p.A. ("Akzo"), both completed earlier in 2007. These acquisitions contributed approximately $21.3 million of the revenue increase over the prior year quarter in this segment, meaning the core portion of this segment grew 18.5%. The overall increase in sales volume and product mix drove improved segment earnings to $2.1 million, up 90.2% compared to the $1.1 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This segment's quarterly earnings result also includes non-cash amortization expense of $0.7 million derived from the Chinook acquisition. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $12.9 million, an increase of 24.5% from the prior year comparable quarter. This strong double-digit sales growth was driven principally by improved volume globally of human choline products, and continued strong sales of REASHURE(R), NiashureTM, and KeyshureTM, our specialty animal nutrition and health products targeted predominantly for ruminant animals. The Food sector was up slightly as domestic market increases were offset with soft international food sales in the quarter. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 112.6% to $2.2 million, as compared to $1.0 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated consistent quarterly earnings from operations which were $2.9 million, up 2.5%, on quarterly sales of $8.2 million. This 3.5% increase in sales, over the prior year quarter, principally occurred from increased volumes sold of ethylene oxide products. Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 was $12.6 million, or an increase of 45.4% compared to $8.7 million for the prior year comparable period. The consolidated gross margin, as a percent of sales, has declined in direct correlation to the proportional increase of the BCP Ingredient sales levels. This gross margin was also slightly lower than expected, due to certain petro-chemical raw material cost increases, incurred in the period, that could not be offset with timely price increases. We have begun to implement price increases, but the rate of raw material cost increases, and more importantly, the frequency of these increases are creating considerable challenges to mitigating the short term unfavorable impact. Also in the quarter, our results reflect typical seasonality associated with the summer holiday period in Europe, and were quite unfavorable from a manufacturing variance standpoint at the Marano Ticino facility, but we have rebounded nicely in the following periods. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 46.6% to $5.4 million, as compared to $3.7 million for the prior year comparable quarter, and were comparable to the quarter ending June 30, 2007, decreasing to 10.7% of net sales, down from 14.7% in the prior year quarter. This increase in operating expenses was primarily due to additional amortization and selling expenses associated with the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net sales have increased 63.7% to $122.5 million compared to $74.8 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 32.0% to $12 million, generating $0.65 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $9.1 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Late in the first quarter of 2007, we borrowed $39 million; the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. At September 30, 2007, our outstanding long term debt was $33.8 million reflecting accelerated payments of $2.5 million, and with $5.5 million in cash and quality accounts receivable of $27.4 million, we are well positioned to continue with an aggressive debt reduction program. Outlook Commenting on 2007, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem said, "The integrations of the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions have gone well and as planned. While this third quarter result does not yet reflect all of the synergies that we expect for our choline platforms, we have made significant progress. The acquisitions continue to contribute accretively to our earnings even with the earlier noted high level of amortization expense associated with acquisition accounting. We have improved the results of our calcium products for the pharmaceutical and OTC markets as we discussed last quarter and expect this result to continue. Raw material costs have been, and will continue to be, a challenge in the near term. Results for the fourth quarter will likely be impacted due to certain recently announced raw material price increases and forecasted trends for the coming months. We are taking pricing actions, as appropriate, to lessen the impact of these raw material cost increases; however, actions taken by the Company in the fourth quarter are not expected to have a full impact until 2008. With that said, we do expect the fourth quarter to reflect continued positive results, supporting, with slight moderation, our previously noted expectation of concluding the year with excellent double digit growth in sales and earnings." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be held on Monday, November 5, 2007 at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review third quarter 2007 results. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, CFO, will host the call.

Any fiduciary may vote shares standing in his name as such fiduciary, either in person or by proxy. Shares of its own stock belonging to this corporation shall not be voted, directly or indirectly, at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time, but shares of its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity may be voted by a committee consisting of all the directors of the corporation who shall vote all the shares in proportion to the vote of the directors, except in an election of directors, when all such shares shall be divided into an equal number of parts, which number of parts shall correspond to the number of directors being elected, and a part shall be voted for each director proposed by immediate past management, and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time.

Exhibit 99.1 Balchem Corporation Announces 4th Quarter 2007 Results ------------------------------------------------------ New Hampton, NY - March 4, 2008 BALCHEM CORPORATION (NASDAQ: BCPC) reported as follows (unaudited) for the period ended December 31, 2007 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) For the Three Months Ended December 31, --------------------------------------- 2007 2006 --------- --------- Net sales $ 53,733 $ 26,086 Gross profit 12,398 8,311 Operating expenses 5,816 3,469 --------- --------- Earnings from operations 6,582 4,842 Other income (expense) (206) 23 --------- --------- Earnings before income tax expense 6,376 4,865 Income tax expense 2,221 1,651 --------- --------- Net earnings $ 4,155 $ 3,214 ========= ========= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.23 $ 0.18 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.22 $ 0.17 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 18,811 18,390 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, ---------------------------------------- 2007 2006 --------- --------- Net sales $ 176,201 $ 100,905 Gross profit 46,930 34,006 Operating expenses 21,024 14,844 --------- --------- Earnings from operations 25,906 19,162 Other income (expense) (1,077) (61) --------- --------- Earnings before income tax expense 24,829 19,101 Income tax expense 8,711 6,823 --------- --------- Net earnings $ 16,118 $ 12,278 ========= ========= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.91 $ 0.70 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.87 $ 0.67 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 18,611 18,247
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 New Record Quarter Results for Sales Quarterly record net sales of $53.7 million were achieved for the ---------------------------- period ended December 31, 2007. This is an increase of 106% above the $26.1 million result of the prior year comparable quarter, and was derived from both organic and acquisition growth. Net earnings for the quarter were $4.2 million, an increase of $.9 million, or 29.3% as compared with the same period last year. The $4.2 million in net earnings resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of 29.4%, or $0.22 per share for the fourth quarter of 2007 versus $0.17 per share for the prior year comparable quarter. Detailing the fourth quarter of 2007, the BCP Ingredients segment achieved record quarterly sales of $31.6 million. This result reflects sales derived from the acquisitions of the customer list of Chinook Group Limited ("Chinook") and certain assets of Akzo Nobel Chemicals S.p.A. ("Akzo"), both completed earlier in 2007. These acquisitions contributed approximately $23.5 million of the revenue increase over the prior year quarter in this segment, meaning the core portion of this segment grew 13.1%. Earnings from operations for this segment were a bit soft, improving 36.1% to $1.1 million as compared to $0.81 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This segment's current quarterly earnings result includes non-cash amortization expense of $0.7 million related specifically to the Chinook acquisition. It also was impacted unfavorably by a significant, rapid increase in the cost of methanol in the quarter. Sales of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment were $13.8 million, an increase of 26.7% from the prior year comparable quarter. This segment growth was organic only, as the human sector increased 30% with particular strength in sales of choline, domestic and international food, as well as pharma calcium products. Our specialty animal nutrition and health products, targeted predominantly for ruminant animals, realized approximately 21% growth over the 2006 Q4 results with continued strong sales of Reashure(R), Nitroshure(TM) and Niashure(TM). Earnings from operations for this segment improved 127.7% to $2.6 million, as compared to $1.1 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $8.4 million, a 3.5% increase over the prior year quarter, principally from increased volumes of ethylene oxide products. Earnings from operations were flat due to increases in the cost of petro-chemical raw materials. Gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 was $12.4 million, or an increase of 49.2% compared to $8.3 million for the prior year comparable period. The consolidated gross margin, as a percent of sales, at 23.1% declined in direct correlation to the proportional increase of the BCP Ingredient sales levels. This gross margin was lower than expected, due to certain petro-chemical raw material cost increases, which negatively affected the BCP Ingredients and Specialty Products segments that could not be offset with timely price increases. We had begun to implement price increases, but the rate of raw material cost increases, and more importantly, the frequency of these increases did create considerable challenges to mitigating the short term unfavorable impact. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 67.7% to $5.8 million, as compared to $3.5 million for the prior year comparable quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 10.8%, down from 13.3% in the prior year quarter. This increase in operating expenses, over the prior year, was primarily due to the additional amortization and selling expenses associated with the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, net sales have increased 74.6% to $176.2 million compared to $100.9 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 have increased 31.3% to $16.1 million, generating $0.87 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $12.3 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Late in the first quarter of 2007, we borrowed $39 million; the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. At December 31, 2007, our outstanding borrowings were $28.0 million reflecting accelerated payments of $9.0 million. We have quality accounts receivable of $29.6 million and are well positioned to continue with an aggressive debt reduction program. Outlook Commenting on 2007, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem said, "The integrations of the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions have gone well. This fourth quarter result does not reflect our expectations of the impact from the acquisitions due to raw material increases, nor are all of the synergies achieved for our choline platforms, but we have made significant progress. The acquisitions continue to contribute accretively to our earnings even with the earlier noted raw material cost increases and the high level of amortization expense associated with acquisition accounting. We have improved the results of our calcium products for the pharmaceutical and OTC markets as we discussed last quarter and expect this result to continue. Raw material costs have been, and will continue to be a challenge in the near term. We are taking pricing actions, as appropriate, to lessen the impact of these raw material cost increases; however, actions taken by the Company in the fourth quarter, due largely to their timing, did not offset these cost increases , but will have more impact on 2008. With that said, 2007 results were very strong with sales up 75% and net earnings up 31%. We have implemented additional price increases effective January 1, 2008, to pass on the raw material increases noted earlier. With this action and our continued growth plans, we expect 2008 to be another year of continuing quality double digit improvements in sales and earnings, pending global economic issues." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be held on Tuesday, March 4, 2008 at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review fourth quarter 2007 results. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, CFO, will host the call.

Exhibit Index Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation, dated May 8, 2008

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) Exhibit 99.1 Balchem Corporation Announces 1st Quarter 2008 Results ------------------------------------------------------ New Hampton, NY - May 8, 2008 BALCHEM CORPORATION (NASDAQ: BCPC) reported as follows (unaudited) for the period ended March 31, 2008 ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings Per Share) For the Three Months Ended March 31, ------------------------------------ 2008 2007 -------- -------- Net sales $ 56,861 $ 27,599 Gross profit 13,483 9,741 Operating expenses 6,079 4,399 -------- -------- Earnings from operations 7,404 5,342 Other expense (213) (28) -------- -------- Earnings before income tax expense 7,191 5,314 Income tax expense 2,550 1,873 -------- -------- Net earnings $ 4,641 $ 3,441 ======== ======== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.26 $ 0.19 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.25 $ 0.19 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 18,853 18,385 New Record Quarter Results for Sales and Earnings Record net sales of $56.9 million were achieved for the quarter ended ---------------- March 31, 2008. This is an increase of 106% above the $27.6 million result of the prior year comparable quarter and was derived from both organic and acquisition growth. Record net earnings for the quarter were $4.6 million, an ------------------- increase of $1.2 million, or 34.9% as compared with the same period last year. The $4.6 million in net earnings generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.25 per share for the first quarter of 2008 versus $0.19 per share for the prior year, an increase of 31.6%. Effective with the quarter ending March 31, 2008, the Company has realigned its business segment reporting structure to more appropriately reflect the internal management of the businesses, largely due to the impact of the recent acquisitions of 2007. Segment information from prior year periods contained herein has been revised to reflect the comparative business segment reporting. The Company will continue to report three segments: ARC Specialty Products; Food, Pharma and Nutrition; and Animal Nutrition and Health. Changes to the reporting segments are as follows: Chelated minerals and specialty nutritional products for the animal health industry, formerly reported as a part of the Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment, are now combined with the Choline business (formerly BCP Ingredients) into a consolidated Animal Nutrition and Health segment. The Encapsulated/Nutritional Products segment has been renamed Food, Pharma and Nutrition, focusing on human health. There are no changes to the ARC Specialty Products segment.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 Detailing the first quarter of 2008, the Animal Nutrition and Health segment achieved record quarterly sales of $39.1 million. This result reflects sales derived from the acquisitions of the customer list of Chinook Group Limited ("Chinook") and certain assets of Akzo Nobel Chemicals S.p.A. ("Akzo"), both completed in 2007. These acquisitions contributed approximately $25 million of the revenue increase over the prior year. Our specialty animal nutrition and health products, targeted predominantly for ruminant animals, now included in this segment, realized approximately 31.5% growth over the 2007 Q1 results with strong sales of Reashure(R), Nitroshure(TM), Niashure(TM) and Chelated Minerals. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 55.1% to $3.3 million as compared to $2.1 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This segment's current quarterly earnings result includes non-cash amortization expense of $0.7 million related to the Chinook acquisition. This segment was impacted unfavorably by the continued rise in raw material costs, and while we did experience some relief towards the end of the first quarter, overall raw material costs have stayed firm. Sales of the Food, Pharma and Nutrition segment were $9.3 million, an increase of 28.8% from the prior year comparable quarter. This segment growth was organic, with continued strength in sales of human grade choline, domestic and international food, as well as pharma calcium products. Earnings from operations for this segment improved to $1.5 million, as compared to $0.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $8.5 million, a 4.8% increase over the prior year quarter, principally from increased volumes of ethylene oxide products. Earnings in this segment declined $0.3 million principally due to increases in the cost of petro-chemical raw materials and increased operating expenses which impacted all business segments. Gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 was $13.5 million, an increase of 38.4% compared to $9.7 million for the prior year comparable period. The consolidated gross margin, as a percent of sales, at 23.7%, declined in direct correlation to the proportional increase of the above noted acquisition related sales. Despite the implementation of price increases, and slight improvement sequentially over the fourth quarter, we were not able to fully recover the cost increases in certain petro-chemical raw materials, which continued or trended up within the quarter. On this note, our gross margin was lower than expected in both the Animal Nutrition and Health and Specialty Products segments, but the company anticipates improved gross margin results in the near term. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 38.2% to $6.1 million, as compared to $4.4 million for the prior year comparable quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 10.7%, down from 15.9% in the prior year quarter. This increase in operating expenses, over the prior year, was primarily due to additional amortization and selling expenses associated with the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions, higher research expenses for the pharmaceutical initiatives, and higher G&A expenses due to increased audit, tax, accounting and non-cash stock-based compensation recognition. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Late in the first quarter of 2007, we borrowed $39 million; the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. At March 31, 2008, our outstanding borrowings were $25.8 million reflecting accelerated payments of $11.0 million. We are well positioned to continue with an aggressive debt reduction program.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 Outlook Commenting on 2008, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem said, "The integrations of the 2007 acquisitions have gone well. This record first quarter result does not yet reflect our full expectations of the acquisitions, but they are contributing accretively to our earnings, even with the earlier noted raw material cost increases and the high level of amortization expense associated with the acquisition accounting. Rising raw material costs are likely to continue being a challenge in the near term. We continue to take pricing actions, as appropriate, to lessen the impact of these raw material cost increases; however, actions taken by the Company in the first quarter, due largely to their timing, did not offset all cost increases. We continue to see improved results of our calcium products for the pharmaceutical and OTC markets, with a couple of new calcium product launches scheduled for the second quarter. The Animal Nutrition and Health segment is realizing excellent global revenue growth in both the specialty and basic choline product lines. Our pharmaceutical research efforts will continue to generate milestone payments throughout the balance of the year. We expect 2008 to be another year of continuing quality double digit improvements in sales and earnings, as we leverage our production capacity and business infrastructure."

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 New Record Quarter Results for Sales and Earnings - ------------------ Record net sales of $62.9 million were achieved for the quarter ended ---------------- June 30, 2008. This is an increase of 41.8% above the $44.4 million result of the prior year quarter and was derived from both organic and acquisition growth. Accordingly, record net earnings for the quarter were $4.7 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 16.2% as compared with the same period last year. The $4.7 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.25 per common share versus $0.22 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 13.6%. Effective with the quarter ending March 31, 2008, the Company has realigned its business segment reporting structure to more appropriately reflect the internal management of the businesses, largely due to the impact of the acquisitions in 2007. Segment information from prior year periods contained herein has been revised to reflect the realignment. The Company's reportable business segments are: ARC Specialty Products; Food, Pharma and Nutrition; and Animal Nutrition and Health. Detailing the second quarter of 2008, the Animal Nutrition and Health segment achieved record quarterly sales of $44.6 million, an increase of $16.5 million over the prior year quarter. This result reflects incomparable sales due to the acquisition of certain assets of Akzo Nobel Chemicals S.p.A. ("Akzo"), completed in April 2007. This acquisition contributed approximately $7.8 million of the incremental revenue increase over the prior year, with the balance, $8.7 million, equaling 40.7% of organic growth. On a quarterly sequential basis, this business segment grew 14.0% or $5.5 million, largely as a result of increased international sales, continued strong volumes from our specialty animal health products and increases in our average selling prices. Our specialty animal nutrition and health products, targeted predominantly for ruminant animals, realized approximately 68.3% growth over the 2007 Q2 results with strong sales of Reashure(R), Nitroshure(TM), and chelated minerals. Earnings from operations for this entire segment did however decline 5.7% to $2.9 million as compared to $3.0 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to the continued increases in petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline. These raw material costs, again, continued to rise at a very swift pace in the quarter, and while some were passed on to customers, our pricing initiatives in the quarter were not enough to offset all of the cost increases. Additional price increases have been, and will be, implemented where we are contractually able to do so in the third quarter, as our businesses are likely to remain affected by these higher costs for the balance of 2008. Sales of the Food, Pharma and Nutrition segment were $9.5 million, an increase of 19.6% from the prior year comparable quarter. This segment growth was organic, with strong sales of human grade choline and pharma calcium products. Earnings from operations for this segment improved to $1.7 million, as compared to $0.7 million in the prior year comparable quarter. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $8.8 million, a 5.4% increase over the prior year quarter principally from increases in volume and selling price of ethylene oxide products sold. During the second quarter, we did increase prices to help off-set cost increases, but we did trail the rapid raw material increases, hence earnings in this segment declined $0.3 million. We continue to monitor the seemingly constant petro-chemical raw material price escalation and seek to implement price increases within contractual guidelines. Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 was $13.0 million, an increase of 6.3% compared to $12.2 million for the prior year comparable period. The consolidated gross margin, as a percent of sales, at 20.6%, declined as a result of the above noted acquisition related sales, which carry a lower gross margin, and despite the implementation of price increases, we were not able to
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 fully recover the increases in certain petro-chemical raw materials, which continued or trended up within the quarter. The current raw material environment remains unpredictable. We are however, continuing to focus on implementing price increases, productivity improvements, and, most importantly, growth through new product development. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses increased 5.9% to $5.7 million, as compared to $5.4 million for the prior year comparable quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 9.1%, down from 12.2% in the prior year quarter. This increase in operating expenses, over the prior year, was primarily due to higher research expenses for the pharmaceutical initiatives, and higher G&A expenses due to increased fees for audit, tax accounting, and non-cash stock-based compensation recognition. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net sales have increased 66.4% to $119.8 million compared to $72.0 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 24.8% to $9.4 million, generating $0.50 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $7.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Balance sheet ratios and our cash flow continue to be strong. Late in the second quarter of 2007, we borrowed $39 million; the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. At June 30, 2008, our outstanding borrowings were $24 million reflecting accelerated payments of $12.5 million on our term loan. We will look to continue to aggressively reduce our outstanding debt balance through the remainder of 2008. Outlook Commenting on 2008, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem said, "This record second quarter, despite difficult business conditions, demonstrates the value of our diversified business. Our increasing global presence, with solid overseas demand, is off-setting certain softness in some U.S. markets. While rising raw material costs have had an impact on our results, and they are likely to continue being a challenge in the near term, we will take appropriate actions to improve operating margins and cash flow. We continue to see improved results of human grade choline, due to growing consumer awareness, and of our calcium products for the pharmaceutical and nutritional markets, with new calcium product launches scheduled for the fourth quarter. The Animal Nutrition and Health segment is realizing excellent global revenue growth in both the specialty and basic choline product lines. Our pharmaceutical research efforts continue, and we expect to generate milestone payments over the balance of the year. We continue to expect 2008 to be a year of quality double digit improvements in sales and earnings, as we leverage our production capacity and business infrastructure." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be held on Thursday, July 31, 2008 at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review second quarter 2008 results. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, CFO, will host the call.

Exhibit Index Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation dated October 8, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1 For Immediate Release - --------------------- For More Information: Dr. Dana E. Putnam Balchem 845-326-5693 Phone dputnam@balchem.com www.balchem.com Balchem Introduces Rumen-Protected Lysine New Hampton, New York. October 8, 2008. Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ: BCPC) announced that the first proven rumen-protected lysine for use in dairy rations was introduced by the Animal Nutrition and Health Division of Balchem at the World Dairy Expo in Madison, Wisconsin. "AminoShure(TM)-L gives nutritionists and dairy producers a long awaited source of rumen-protected lysine," says Dr. Dana Putnam, Vice President and General Manager of Balchem's Animal Nutrition and Health Division. "It provides the industry with a precise and consistent source of lysine that can be used in concert with or replacement of typical feed sources of lysine which are often inadequate or inconsistent sources of lysine. "AminoShure(TM)-L permits ration formulations that more closely approximate an animal's lysine requirements without the excesses of crude protein that typically accompany lysine in conventional feed ingredients. This opens the door to higher milk production with desired milk component levels and, equally important, to less nitrogen excreted as waste." Research has clearly shown that limitations in lysine supply to a dairy cow will limit milk component levels and milk production. Cows typically are unable to synthesize adequate quantities of lysine to fully meet nutritional requirements and most protein supplements contain insufficient lysine for cows. Despite years of research and development, the dairy industry has lacked a practical and consistent tool to effectively meet the lysine demands of cows, until now. Balchem's position as the global leader in nutrient delivery technology, including over 100 different encapsulated products for animal, human and industrial markets, uniquely positions it to solve this type of challenge. AminoShure-L, which is the culmination of an intensive six year research program, benefiting from Balchem's growing proprietary encapsulation technology, successfully bypasses the rumen and reaches the small intestine, where it is readily released and absorbed. Segment Information Balchem Corporation consists of three business segments: ARC Specialty Products; Food, Pharma and Nutrition; and Animal Nutrition and Health. Through ARC Specialty Products, Balchem provides specialty-packaged chemicals for use in healthcare and other industries. The Food, Pharma and Nutrition segment provides proprietary micro encapsulation, granulation and agglomeration solutions to a variety of applications in the human food, pharmaceutical and nutrition marketplaces. The Animal Nutrition and Health segment manufactures and supplies products, including encapsulated ingredients, Keyshure (TM) organic trace minerals and animal grade choline to numerous animal health markets and certain derivative products into industrial applications. Forward Looking Statements This release contains forward-looking statements, which reflect Balchem's expectation or belief concerning future events that involve risks and uncertainties. Balchem can give no assurance that the expectations reflected in forward looking statements will prove correct and various factors could cause results to differ materially from Balchem's expectations, including risks and factors identified in Balchem's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Exhibit Index Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation, dated October 30, 2008

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Balchem Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2008 Results -------------------------------------------------------- New Hampton, NY, October 30, 2008 - Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ: BCPC) reported as follows (unaudited) for the period ended September 30, 2008. ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings per Share) For the Three Months Ended September 30, ---------------------------------------- 2008 2007 ---- ---- Net sales $ 58,235 $ 50,498 Gross profit 12,712 12,609 Operating expenses 5,486 5,416 --------- --------- Earnings from operations 7,226 7,193 Other expense (290) (421) --------- --------- Earnings before income tax expense 6,936 6,772 Income tax expense 2,143 2,315 --------- --------- Net earnings $ 4,793 $ 4,457 ========= ========= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.27 $ 0.25 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.25 $ 0.24 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 19,131 18,657 For the Nine Months Ended September 30, --------------------------------------- 2008 2007 ---- ---- Net sales $ 177,997 $ 122,468 Gross profit 39,146 34,532 Operating expenses 17,276 15,208 --------- --------- Earnings from operations 21,870 19,324 Other expense (742) (871) --------- --------- Earnings before income tax expense 21,128 18,453 Income tax expense 6,970 6,490 --------- --------- Net earnings $ 14,158 $ 11,963 ========= ========= Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.79 $ 0.67 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.75 $ 0.65 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 18,987 18,544
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 Record Third Quarter Results for Earnings Net sales of $58.2 million were achieved for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. This is an increase of 15.3% above the $50.5 million result of the prior year comparable quarter, resulting in record net earnings for the quarter of $4.8 million, an increase of $0.3 million, or 7.5%. The $4.8 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.25 per common share versus $0.24 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 4.2%. Detailing this third quarter of 2008, the Animal Nutrition and Health segment achieved quarterly sales of $39.6 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 15.3%, over the prior year quarter. Within this segment, the specialty animal nutrition and health products, targeted predominantly for ruminant animals, realized approximately 27.8% growth over the 2007 third quarter results with continued strong sales of Reashure(R), Nitroshure(TM), and chelated minerals. Feed and industrial grade choline product sales and derivatives grew approximately 13.2% over the prior year quarter, principally from increases in volume and selling price. Earnings from operations for this entire segment did however decline to $2.3 million as compared to $3.0 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to the continued price increases in petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline. While oil and natural gas prices have recently declined, we were not a beneficiary of this trend until very late in the quarter. Our raw material costs actually rose early in the third quarter before modestly declining, and while some costs were passed on to customers, our pricing initiatives in the quarter were not enough to offset the cost increases. Additional price increases have been, and will be, implemented where we are contractually able to do so in the fourth quarter, and we do have an expectation that we will see some relief from these higher raw material costs for the balance of 2008. In addition, the Company temporarily shut down production during the quarter at its facility in St. Gabriel, LA as a direct result of hurricanes Gustav and Ike. While this plant suffered no direct damage from these hurricanes, hurricane-related utility and supply disruptions interrupted our ability to produce products, yet substantially all of our fixed costs remained throughout the interruption, as we positioned for a timely re-start of the operation. These noted raw material supply interruptions also negatively impacted the operation of our Verona, MO site, and have continued early into the fourth quarter. Also in the quarter, our results reflect the typical seasonality associated with the summer holiday period in Europe, and were quite unfavorable from a manufacturing variance standpoint at the Marano Ticino, Italy facility, but we have since rebounded nicely. Sales of the Food, Pharma and Nutrition segment were $9.4 million, an increase of 18.1% from the prior year comparable quarter. This segment growth was derived from improvement in the domestic and international food markets and continued strong sales of human grade choline and pharma grade calcium products. Earnings from operations for this segment improved 24.9% to $1.6 million, as compared to $1.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter, but were negatively impacted in the quarter as we converted our choline process to a more environmentally friendly process. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated earnings from operations of $3.4 million on record quarterly sales of $9.3 million. Earnings from operations for this segment were 15.5% higher than the prior year quarter, due to a 12.7% increase in sales, principally from increases in volume and selling price of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 Gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 was $12.7 million, as compared to $12.6 million for the prior year comparable period. The consolidated gross margin, as a percent of sales, at 21.8%, declined as a result of the above-noted increase in raw material costs and hurricane related interruptions, but did increase sequentially over the second quarter 2008 result. As previously noted, we continue to focus on implementing raw material cost driven price increases, productivity improvements, and, most importantly, growth through new product development. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses at $5.5 million, were essentially flat with the prior year comparable quarter, but decreased as a percentage of sales to 9.4%, down from 10.7% in the prior year quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net sales have increased 45.3% to $178.0 million compared to $122.5 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 18.3% to $14.2 million, generating $0.75 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $12.0 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Balance sheet ratios and cash flow continue to be strong. Early in 2007, we borrowed $39 million; the proceeds of which were used to complete the funding of the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. At September 30, 2008, our outstanding borrowings were $17.1 million, reflecting accelerated payments of $14.5 million over the $7.4 million scheduled term payments of the loan. We will continue to aggressively manage our balance sheet and reduce our outstanding debt balance through the remainder of 2008. Outlook Commenting on 2008, Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO of Balchem said, "This record third quarter, despite numerous difficult business conditions, demonstrates the value of our neatly diversified business. Our strategic acquisitions, with cross business motivation and integration, are increasing our global presence, and off-setting certain softness in some U.S. markets. While rising raw material costs have had a continued negative impact, we do expect to begin experiencing relief in the near term on some key raw materials. We will continue to take appropriate actions to improve operating margins and cash flow. We expect improved results in the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment, particularly in the choline, calcium, domestic and international food products. We continue to develop the pharmaceutical delivery systems that can benefit from our technologies. The Animal Nutrition & Health segment realized margin pressure again in the quarter, but we did implement some price increases with the expectation that raw material relief will begin to take effect for this marketplace in general, restoring many end specie producers to improved financial stability. The ARC Specialty Products segment continued its steady revenue growth and solid profit results with improved volumes and some price increases, as well. Although there is considerable volatility in the global economy, we expect 2008 to be, as previously noted, a year of quality double digit improvements in sales and earnings, as we continue to implement lean production and logistics capabilities, leveraging on our existing business and research infrastructure." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be held on Thursday, October 30, 2008 at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review third quarter 2008 results. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, CFO, will host the call. We invite you

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Balchem Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter 2008 Results --------------------------------------------------------- New Hampton, NY, February 24, 2009 - Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ: BCPC) reported as follows (unaudited) for the period ended December 31, 2008. ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings per Share) For the Three Months Ended December 31, --------------------------------------- 2008 2007 ---- ---- Net sales $ 54,053 $ 53,733 Gross profit 13,432 12,398 Operating expenses 5,954 5,816 ------------ ------------ Earnings from operations 7,478 6,582 Other expense (175) (206) ------------ ------------ Earnings before income tax expense 7,303 6,376 Income tax expense 2,411 2,221 ------------ ------------ Net earnings $ 4,892 $ 4,155 ============ ============ Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.27 $ 0.23 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.26 $ 0.22 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 19,094 18,811 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, ---------------------------------------- 2008 2007 ---- ---- Net sales $ 232,050 $ 176,201 Gross profit 52,578 46,930 Operating expenses 23,230 21,024 ------------ ------------ Earnings from operations 29,348 25,906 Other expense (917) (1,077) ------------ ------------ Earnings before income tax expense 28,431 24,829 Income tax expense 9,381 8,711 ------------ ------------ Net earnings $ 19,050 $ 16,118 ============ ============ Basic net earnings per common share $ 1.06 $ 0.91 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 1.00 $ 0.87 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 19,014 18,611
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 Record Fourth Quarter Results for Sales and Earnings Record net sales of $54.1 million were achieved for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, an increase of approximately 1% above the $53.7 million result of the prior year comparable quarter. The company achieved record net earnings for the quarter of $4.9 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 17.7%. The $4.9 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.26 per common share versus $0.22 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 18.2%. Detailing this fourth quarter of 2008, the Animal Nutrition and Health segment achieved quarterly sales of $37.2 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 2.3%, over the prior year quarter. Within this segment, the specialty animal nutrition and health products, targeted predominantly for ruminant animals, realized approximately 11.1% growth over the 2007 fourth quarter results with continued strong sales of Reashure(R) and Nitroshure(R), in addition to new sales generated from our initial launch of AminoShure(TM)-L., a rumen protected lysine designed to deliver consistent lysine levels and enhance amino acid nutrient availability to dairy cows. Feed grade choline and industrial derivatives grew approximately 1.0% over the prior year quarter, as industrial derivative increases were partially offset by a slight decline in feed grade choline, particularly into the poultry markets. We continued to experience hurricane-related raw material supply chain disruptions until late in the fourth quarter, which slowed our ability to produce, hence sell product into certain international markets. However, earnings from operations for this entire ANH segment did increase to $2.9 million as compared to $1.8 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to favorable product mix in addition to reductions in the cost of certain petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline and derivatives. Sales of the Food, Pharma and Nutrition segment were $7.6 million, a decrease of 15.7% or $1.4 million from the prior year comparable quarter. While full year sales of this segment were up 11.4% for 2008, quarterly comparative sales results for this segment continue to reflect the roller-coaster effect of pipeline fills, year end inventory level management, and some effects of the worldwide economic downturn at year end on our customers. Earnings from operations for this segment declined to $0.7 million, as compared to $1.9 million in the prior year comparable quarter, due to the softness in sales volume; hence lower/unfavorable manufacturing levels, as we, too, controlled/reduced inventory levels. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated record fourth quarter sales of $9.3 million, an increase of 10.6% over the comparable prior year quarter. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $3.8 million, were 30.8% higher than the prior year quarter, principally from increased volumes of ethylene oxide and methyl chloride, and increased selling prices. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 was $13.4 million, and, as compared to $12.4 million for the prior year comparable period, increased from 23.1% to 24.9% of sales, as a result of certain segments' product mix, price increases and declines in raw material costs. As previously noted, we continue to focus on gross margin improvement, implementing raw material cost driven price increases, production and supply chain improvements, and top line growth through new product development. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses at $6.0 million, increased $0.1 million over the prior year comparable quarter, but decreased to 10% of sales for all of 2008, a reduction from 11.9% in 2007.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 For the twelve months ended December 31, net sales increased 31.7% to $232.0 million compared to $176.2 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings increased 18.2% to $19.1 million, generating $1.00 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $16.1 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Balance sheet ratios and cash flow continue to be strong. Early in 2007, we borrowed $39 million; the proceeds of which were used to fund the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. At December 31, 2008, our outstanding borrowings were $11.6 million, $8.2 million net of cash, reflecting accelerated payments of $17.5 million over the scheduled term payments of the loan. We have quality accounts receivable of $30.3 million, inventory levels of $16.6 million, which were reduced by 6% from September 30, 2008, so we are well positioned to continue with an aggressive debt reduction program. Outlook Commenting on 2008, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem said, "This record fourth quarter, combined with strong performances across Balchem's business in the first nine months of the year, despite the well publicized difficult economic conditions, continues to demonstrate the value of our diversified business. Our prior year strategic acquisitions, with improved cross business integration, have increased our global presence; thereby off-setting softness in some U.S. markets. Raw material costs have had continued negative impact on certain segments, but we have begun experiencing relief on certain key raw materials. We will continue to closely monitor key economic drivers, stay customer focused, and take appropriate actions to improve operating margins and cash flow. Year over year, we expect improved results in the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment, particularly in the choline, calcium, domestic and international food products. The Animal Nutrition & Health segment realized some margin relief in the quarter, despite supply chain interruptions, that now appear to be behind us. Nevertheless, many end specie producers continue to have financial issues, so our focus on successful new product launches and continued production efficiencies are critical. The ARC Specialty Products segment continues its steady revenue growth and solid profit results with improved volumes and some price increases, as we continue to develop new market opportunities for specialized delivery of certain gases. There certainly is considerable volatility in the global economy, but we expect 2009 to be a year of improvements in sales and earnings, as we continue to implement lean programs, de-bottleneck production capabilities, and leverage our existing business and research infrastructure. Our healthy financial situation has us positioned to capitalize on opportunities that will likely arise from the current economic environment." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be held on Tuesday, February 24, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review fourth quarter and full year 2008 results. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, CFO, will host the call.

Exhibit Index Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press Release of Balchem Corporation, dated May 1, 2009

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Balchem Corporation Announces First Quarter 2009 Results -------------------------------------------------------- New Hampton, NY, May 1, 2009 - Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ: BCPC) reported as follows (unaudited) for the period ended March 31, 2009. ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings per Share) For the Three Months Ended March 31, ------------------------------------ 2009 2008 ---- ---- Net sales $ 52,986 $ 56,861 Gross profit 16,298 13,483 Operating expenses 6,988 6,079 ---------- ---------- Earnings from operations 9,310 7,404 Other expense (144) (213) ---------- ---------- Earnings before income tax expense 9,166 7,191 Income tax expense 3,068 2,550 ---------- ---------- Net earnings $ 6,098 $ 4,641 ========== ========== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.34 $ 0.26 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.32 $ 0.25 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 19,029 18,853 Record Results for Earnings For the first quarter ended March 31, 2009, the company achieved record net earnings of $6.1 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 31.4%. The $6.1 million generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.32 versus $0.25 for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 28.0%. Net sales of $53.0 million was a decrease of approximately 6.8% below the $56.9 million result of the prior year comparable quarter, and off a modest 2.0% sequentially from fourth quarter 2008. Detailing this first quarter of 2009, the Animal Nutrition and Health segment achieved quarterly sales of $35.9 million, a decrease of $3.2 million, or 8.3%, from the prior year quarter. Sales in this segment were negatively impacted by approximately 4% due to foreign currency fluctuation associated with the Italian operation. Within this segment, the specialty animal nutrition and health products, targeted predominantly for ruminant animals, realized approximately 4.1% growth over the 2008 first quarter results and 10.0 % growth sequentially, with continued strong sales of Reashure(R) and Nitroshure(R), in addition to new sales generated from AminoShure(TM)-L., our rumen protected lysine. These increases were partially offset by slowness in international sales of the chelated mineral products. Sales of feed grade choline and
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 industrial derivatives declined approximately 10.3% from the prior year quarter principally due to declines in volumes sold into the well-publicized soft poultry industry, including slower international sales largely related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2009 versus a weakening dollar in 2008. Sales of industrial derivatives (both choline and methylamines) were impacted by softness in the industrial sector, principally caused by the general economic downturn. Through all of these market activities, earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment did increase to $5.0 million as compared to $3.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to favorable product mix, strong sales from our Italian operation, and reductions in the cost of certain petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline and derivatives. Sales of the Food, Pharma and Nutrition segment were $8.3 million, a decrease of 10.6% or $1.0 million from the prior year comparable quarter; however, sales did grow approximately 9.6% on a sequential basis. Quarterly comparative sales results for this segment continue to reflect the roller-coaster effect of pipeline fills, inventory level management, and some effects of the worldwide economic downturn. The domestic food sector was up, as we continued to see growth from the launch of Choline into new food applications, as well as growth in the bakery, tortilla and preservation markets. We also saw strong double digit increases in our VitaShure(R) products for nutritional enhancement. These results were offset by slowness in sales of calcium products sold into the over-the-counter pharmaceutical markets. Earnings from operations for this segment were $1.0 million, as compared to $1.5 million in the prior year comparable quarter, due to the softness in sales volume; however, on a sequential basis, this result reflects a 35.8% increase from the fourth quarter of 2008. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated record first quarter sales of $8.8 million, an increase of 4.1% over the comparable prior year quarter. This growth was particularly due to continued strong sales of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $3.4 million, improved strongly over the prior year quarter, principally from reductions in the cost of certain petro-chemical raw materials. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 was $16.3 million, as compared to $13.5 million for the prior year comparable period. This increase, from 23.7% of sales to 30.8% of sales, was a result of certain segments' product mix, price increases and declines in certain raw material costs. As previously noted, we continue to focus on gross margin improvement, implementing raw material cost driven price increases, production and supply chain improvements, and sales volume generation through new product launches. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses at $7.0 million, increased $0.9 million over the prior year comparable quarter, as we had some modest expansion of employees, and as we increased some accounts receivable reserves for international accounts. Balance sheet ratios and cash flow continue to be strong. Early in 2007, we borrowed $39 million; the proceeds of which were used to fund the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. At March 31, 2009, our outstanding borrowings were $9.2 million, but zero net of our cash balance of approximately $18.6 million, reflecting accelerated payments of $18.4 million over the scheduled term payments of the loan. We continue to aggressively manage our working capital. Our accounts receivable balance was $25 million at March 31, 2009 and our inventory levels were reduced to $15.3 million, a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2008.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 Outlook Commenting on 2009, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem, said, "This first quarter, while down a consolidated 6.8% in sales, reflects many positives in our business base, which are helping to offset the general global economic pressures. We have continued to focus on driving our cost structure down, not by reducing employee count, but exercising prudent cost control. We are seeing market acceptance of new product launches in both the human and animal sectors, and we continue our technology development in all segments with the target of launching products that will yield cost/value improvements for end markets served. We are staying focused on customer/market needs and global economic drivers. The earnings result of this first quarter is a great start to the year, highlighting the near-term requirement to very aggressively manage our P&L and Balance Sheet to maximize performance, reduce debt and generate cash reserves, to capitalize on other strategic opportunities. Unless there is another significant downturn in the general economies, we expect to see a flat sales result, year over year, but a double digit improvement in earnings for the year." Quarterly Conference Call A quarterly conference call will be held on Friday, May 1, at 2:00 PM Eastern Time (ET) to review first quarter and 2009 results. Dino A. Rossi, President and CEO, and Frank Fitzpatrick, CFO, will host the call.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Balchem Corporation Announces Second Quarter 2009 Results --------------------------------------------------------- New Hampton, NY, July 30, 2009 - Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ: BCPC) reported as follows (unaudited) for the period ended June 30, 2009. ($000 Omitted Except for Net Earnings per Share) For the Three Months Ended June 30, ----------------------------------- 2009 2008 ---- ---- Net sales $ 52,976 $ 62,901 Gross profit 17,304 12,951 Operating expenses 7,019 5,711 ----------- ----------- Earnings from operations 10,285 7,240 Other income (expense) 18 (239) ----------- ----------- Earnings before income tax expense 10,303 7,001 Income tax expense 3,434 2,277 ----------- ----------- Net earnings $ 6,869 $ 4,724 =========== =========== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.38 $ 0.26 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.36 $ 0.25 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 19,184 18,995 For the Six Months Ended June 30, --------------------------------- 2009 2008 ---- ---- Net sales $ 105,962 $ 119,762 Gross profit 33,602 26,434 Operating expenses 14,007 11,790 ----------- ----------- Earnings from operations 19,595 14,644 Other expense (126) (452) ----------- ----------- Earnings before income tax expense 19,469 14,192 Income tax expense 6,502 4,827 ----------- ----------- Net earnings $ 12,967 $ 9,365 =========== =========== Basic net earnings per common share $ 0.71 $ 0.52 Diluted net earnings per common share $ 0.68 $ 0.50 Shares used in the calculation of diluted net earnings per common share 19,107 18,916
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 Record Results for Earnings For the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, the company achieved record net earnings of $6.9 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 45.4%. The $6.9 million generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.36 versus $0.25 for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 44.0%. Net sales of $53.0 million were approximately 15.8% below the $62.9 million result of the prior year comparable quarter; however, equal to the first quarter 2009 sales results. Detailing this second quarter of 2009, Animal Nutrition and Health, including industrial choline and derivative product sales, totaled $34.8 million, a decrease of 22.0%, or $9.8 million from the prior year quarter, principally from a decline in volume sold into the well-publicized soft U.S. poultry and dairy industry. We also realized lower export sales from our North American choline plants, largely due to the stronger U.S. dollar in 2009 versus 2008 and international political factors affecting poultry exports. This U.S. volume decline was partially offset by increased volumes of choline products sourced from our Italian operation into the European and international poultry markets. This geographic mix lowered consolidated feed grade prices in the quarter, as did lower pricing linked to the decline in raw materials. Sales of industrial derivatives (both choline and methylamines) were negatively impacted by softness, principally caused by the general economic downturn. Sales of our specialty animal nutrition and health products, targeted for ruminant production animals and companion animals, decreased 14.5% from the prior year comparable quarter primarily due to the poor dairy market conditions in the U.S. We did however realize improved sales of chelated mineral products and new sales generated from AminoShure(TM)-L., our rumen protected lysine. Through all of these market activities, earnings from operations for the entire Animal Nutrition and Health segment increased to $5.3 million as compared to $2.9 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to the noted strong sales from our Italian operation, and reductions in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture choline and derivatives, in the U.S. and Europe. Sales of the Food, Pharma and Nutrition segment were $9.1 million, a decrease of 4.0% from the prior year comparable quarter; however, sales did grow approximately 9.5% on a sequential basis. Quarterly comparative sales results for this segment continue to reflect the roller-coaster effect of pipeline fills, inventory level management, and some effects of the worldwide economic downturn. The domestic food sector was up, as we continued to see growth from the launch of Choline into new food applications, as well as growth in the bakery, tortilla and preservation markets. We also saw strong double digit increases in our VitaShure(R) products for nutritional enhancement. These results were offset by slowness in sales of calcium products sold into the over-the-counter pharmaceutical markets and choline sales into the supplement market. Earnings from operations for this segment were $1.3 million, as compared to $1.7 million in the prior year comparable quarter, due to the softness in sales volume; however, this segment result reflects a 33.8% improvement sequentially from the first quarter of 2009. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated record second quarter sales of $9.1 million, an increase of 3.1% over the comparable prior year quarter. This growth was consistent with the continued modest growth of hospital admissions and steady utilization of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $3.7 million, improved 37.8% over the prior year quarter, principally from improved sales and reductions in the cost of certain petro-chemical raw materials.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 was $17.3 million, as compared to $13.0 million for the prior year comparable period. This increase, from 20.6% of sales to 32.7% of sales, was a result of product mix, price increases, plant and logistic efficiencies, and declines in certain key raw material costs. As previously noted, we continue to focus on gross margin improvement, implementing raw material cost driven pricing models, production and supply chain improvements, and sales volume generation through new product launches. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses at $7.0 million, increased $1.3 million over the prior year comparable quarter, as we had some modest increase of employee headcount, and we increased accounts receivable reserves for international accounts. In addition, second quarter operating expenses in 2008 were managed to lower levels as compared to 2009, due to the decline in operating margins that had begun to occur in 2008. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, net sales have decreased 11.5% to $106.0 million compared to $119.8 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 38.5% to $13.0 million, generating $0.68 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $9.4 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period. Balance sheet ratios and cash flow continue to be strong. Early in 2007, we borrowed $39 million, the proceeds of which were used to fund the Chinook and Akzo acquisitions. At June 30, 2009, our outstanding borrowings were $8.1 million, but zero net of our cash balance of approximately $27.1 million. We continue to aggressively manage our working capital. Our accounts receivable balance was $25.0 million at June 30, 2009 and our inventory levels remain reduced at $15.7 million, a decrease of 5% from December 31, 2008. Outlook Commenting on 2009, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem, said, "The second quarter revenues, while off from the record setting second quarter of 2008, reflect many aspects of the continuing difficult global economy. Notably, revenue was sequentially flat with the first quarter results of 2009, and impressively, we have improved our profitability by initiating actions to implement new pricing models, leveraging off of multiple manufacturing capabilities, improving logistics to serve our global customer base, and we also benefitted from the decline in petro-chemical raw materials. We have launched a couple of new products, albeit with modest impact, but given the economically challenged marketplaces we serve, this uptake of new products is encouraging. In fact, our total volumes increased 9.7% sequentially from the first quarter, clearly showing real growth in all segments. We continue to focus on the shifting needs of our customers by developing innovative ideas and lower cost solutions to help them deal with the challenging global economic environment. We continue to prudently manage our P&L and Balance Sheet, generating cash reserves to capitalize on other strategic opportunities. Year over year, given the continued slowness in the global economy, particularly the poultry and dairy markets, we now expect to see a single digit sales decline, but to see double digit improvement in earnings."

Exhibit 99.1 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Balchem Corporation Announces Third Quarter 2009 Results -------------------------------------------------------- New Hampton, NY, October 29, 2009 - Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ: BCPC) reported as follows (unaudited) for the period ended September 30, 2009.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 2 Record Third Quarter Earnings For the quarter ended September 30, 2009, the company achieved record third quarter net earnings of $6.9 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 43.0%. The $6.9 million generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.36 versus $0.25 for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 44.0%. Net sales of $54.3 million were approximately 6.8% below the $58.2 million result of the prior year comparable quarter; however, on a sequential basis, sales were 2.5% greater than the second quarter 2009 sales results. Detailing this third quarter of 2009, Animal Nutrition and Health, including industrial choline and derivative product sales, totaled $36.5 million, a decrease of 7.7%, or $3.0 million from the prior year comparable quarter. This business segment continues to be affected by the well-publicized softness in the U.S. poultry and swine markets as well as weak dairy economics which resulted in lower demand for our products when compared to the prior year quarter; however, on a sequential basis, we did see improvement in sales to these end markets, as they appear to have stabilized, and are beginning to further improve in this fourth quarter. We also realized lower export sales from our North American choline plants, largely due to the stronger U.S. dollar and international political factors affecting poultry exports. Sales of industrial derivatives (both choline and methylamines) were negatively impacted principally by the general economic downturn; however, there was improvement on a sequential basis. Sales of our specialty animal nutrition and health products, targeted for ruminant production animals and companion animals, were up slightly from the prior year comparable quarter primarily due to improved sales of chelated mineral products and new sales generated from AminoShure(TM)-L., our rumen protected lysine. While the market activities fluctuated, earnings from operations for the entire Animal Nutrition and Health segment increased to $5.3 million as compared to $2.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Reductions in key raw materials and improved production/supply chain efficiencies in both the U.S. and Europe led to these improved results. Sales of the Food, Pharma and Nutrition segment were $8.6 million, a decrease of 7.7% from the prior year comparable quarter. Quarterly comparative sales results for this segment continue to reflect the roller-coaster effect of pipeline fills, inventory level management, and some effects of the worldwide economic downturn. The domestic food sector was up again this quarter, as we continue to see growth of choline into new food applications, as well as growth in the tortilla and preservation markets. We also saw sustained strength in sales of our VitaShure(R) products for nutritional enhancement, as it again posted double digit growth. These results were offset by continued slowness of calcium products sold into the over-the-counter pharmaceutical markets, choline sales into the supplement market and weak quarterly sales into the international food market. Earnings from operations for this segment were $1.3 million, as compared to $1.6 million in the prior year comparable quarter, due to the noted softness in sales volume; however, this segment's earnings result reflects a 4.6% improvement sequentially from the second quarter of 2009. The ARC Specialty Products segment generated third quarter sales of $9.1 million, a decrease of 1.9% from the comparable prior year quarter. This modest decline was principally a result of a decline in sales of propylene oxide in the quarter, a result of slowness and order timing of industrial end use markets. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $3.7 million, improved 8.7% over the prior year quarter, principally from reductions in the cost of key petro-chemical raw materials and distribution costs.
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 3 Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 was $16.4 million, as compared to $12.7 million for the prior year comparable period. This increase, from 21.8% of sales to 30.2% of sales, was a result of product mix, price increases, plant and logistics efficiencies, and declines in certain key raw material costs. We are also focused on volume growth of choline into export markets, capitalizing on our varied choline production capabilities, and new product launches. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses at $6.1 million, increased $0.6 million over the prior year comparable quarter, as we had some modest increase of employee headcount. In addition, third quarter operating expenses in 2008 were prudently managed to lower levels, due to the decline in operating margins that had begun to occur in 2008. For the Nine Months ended September 30, 2009, net sales have decreased 10.0% to $160.3 million from $178.0 million in the comparable prior year period. This is an improvement from the 11.5% decline we reported for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net earnings have increased 40.0% to $19.8 million, generating $1.03 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $14.2 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period, and they now exceed the entire twelve month result of 2008. The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with $52.9 million in working capital. Cash on hand amounted to $38.8 million at September 30, 2009, up from $27.1 million at June 30, 2009 and total debt was reduced to $7.3 million. Diligent working capital control, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, has driven strong cash flow generation for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Commenting on 2009, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem, said, "The third quarter revenues, while off approximately 7% from the third quarter of 2008, reflect sustained improvement in earnings, as discussed in the second quarter, with continuing difficult global economics. Notably, revenue increased 2.5% sequentially from the second quarter results of 2009, and impressively, we have sustained improved profitability utilizing new pricing models, leveraging off of multiple manufacturing/logistic capabilities, and we also benefitted from the lower cost of petro-chemical raw materials to serve our global customer base. We have launched new products, albeit with modest impact, but given the economically challenged marketplaces we serve, this uptake of new products is encouraging. In fact, our total volumes improved 3.5% sequentially from the second quarter, showing real growth, particularly in the Animal Nutrition and Health segment. We continue to focus on developing innovative, lower cost solutions to help customers and the markets we serve, deal with the continuing difficult global economic environment. We continue prudent management of our P&L and balance sheet, generating strong financial ratios and cash reserves as we search for other strategic opportunities. Year over year, given continued slowness in the global economy, we expect to see a single digit sales decline, but strong double digit improvement in earnings."

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 
Record Quarterly Earnings and Sales
 For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, the company achieved record net earnings of $7.0 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 42.4%. The $7.0 million generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.24, versus $0.17 for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 41.2%. Record fourth quarter net sales of $59.2 million were approximately 9.5% greater than the $54.1 million result of the prior year comparable quarter; and on a sequential basis, were 9.0% greater than the third quarter 2009 result.
Detailing this fourth quarter of 2009, Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH), including specialties, choline and industrial derivative product sales, totaled $40.4 million, an increase of 8.7%, or $3.2 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Within North American poultry production markets, levels appear to have stabilized and are showing modest growth, resulting in improved sales of choline and certain specialty ingredients. We continue to focus efforts in the international poultry and swine markets, where we realized 39% revenue improvement over the prior year comparable quarter, from exports and European produced choline in particular. The ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to the ruminant and companion animal markets, realized 27% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter, as some regional improvement in dairy economics created improved demand for these products, particularly chelates and Aminoshure-L, our rumen protected lysine. Sales of industrial derivatives (both choline and methylamines) were essentially flat with the prior year quarter; however, there was approximately 11% improvement on a sequential basis.  Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased to $5.9 million as compared to $2.9 million in the prior year comparable quarter.  The above noted increase in sales, product/geographic mix, reductions in key raw materials and improved production/supply chain efficiencies in both the U.S. and Europe led to these improved results.
 
 
Sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were $9.4 million which is a 23.7% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. The domestic and international food sectors were up again this quarter, as we continue to see solid double digit growth of encapsulated ingredients for baking, preservation and confection markets. In the quarter, we also realized double digit growth of our human choline products, both domestic and international, as we continue to target new food applications and experienced some rebound in supplements.  These results were partially offset by continued slowness of calcium products sold into the over-the-counter pharmaceutical markets and a decline in quarterly sales of our VitaShure products for nutritional enhancement. Earnings from operations for this segment were $1.4 million, as compared to $0.7 million in the prior year comparable quarter, with gross margin levels accounting for this gain, largely due to an approximately 11% improvement in sales volume and the product mix.
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated fourth quarter sales of $9.4 million, an increase of 1.0% from the comparable prior year quarter. This modest increase was principally a result of an increase in volumes sold in the quarter. We did however see some softness in certain ethylene oxide products, which reflects industry inventory reduction control and order timing of the medical device sterilization end use markets.  Earnings from operations for this segment, at $3.4 million, decreased 10.6% from the prior year comparable quarter, principally a result of product mix, increased raw material costs, and increased expenses related to development work on our ERC technology for repackaging, distribution and delivery of a product for the fruit ripening industry.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 
 
Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 was $17.0 million, as compared to $13.4 million for the prior year comparable period. This increase, to 28.7% of sales from 24.8% of sales, was a result of product mix, volume and price increases, plant and logistics efficiencies, and net declines in certain key raw material costs. We continue to focus on volume growth of our human and animal health products into export markets, capitalizing on our varied choline production capabilities, and new product launches. Operating (Selling, R&D, and Administrative) expenses at $6.2 million, increased $0.2 million over the prior year comparable quarter, principally a result of some modest increase of employee headcount, other payroll related expenses, and increased investment in R&D.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, net sales decreased 5.4% to $219.4 million from $232.1 million in the comparable prior year period. This is a significant improvement from the 10.0% level of decline we had reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Net earnings, however, increased 40.6% to a record $26.8 million, generating a record $0.93 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $19.1 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period.
The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with $59.2 million in net working capital.  Cash closed at $46.4 million on December 31, 2009, up from $38.8 million at September 30, 2009 and total debt was reduced to $6.8 million. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, combined with the noted improved operating results, drove strong cash flow generation for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Commenting on 2009, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem said, This record fourth quarter reflects strong performances across all of Balchems segments, and despite the well publicized difficult economic conditions, we continue to demonstrate the value of our diversified business. We leveraged cross business integration opportunities and increased our global presence, off-setting softness in certain U.S. markets. Raw material costs have had negative impact on certain segments, but we will continue to closely monitor all key economic drivers, stay customer focused, and take appropriate actions to improve operating margins and cash flow.
Considerable ongoing volatility in the global economy is expected, but we believe 2010 will be a year of improvements in sales and earnings, as we continue to implement lean programs, de-bottleneck production capabilities, leverage our existing business and research infrastructure, and launch new, innovative products through each of our business segments. We expect improved results in the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment, particularly in the choline, calcium, domestic and international food markets. The Animal Nutrition & Health segment realized some margin relief in late 2009, despite supply chain interruptions, which now appear to be behind us. Nevertheless, many end specie producers continue to have financial issues, so our focus on successful new product launches and continued production efficiencies are critical. The ARC Specialty Products segment should continue its steady revenue growth and solid profit results, as well as development of new market opportunities for specialized delivery of certain gases. Our healthy financial situation has us positioned to capitalize on strategic acquisition opportunities that will likely arise from the current economic environment."

Exhibit  99.1
 
Record Quarterly Earnings and Sales
 For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, the company achieved record net earnings of $7.0 million as compared to $6.1 for the prior year comparable period, an increase of $0.9 million, or 15.3%. The $7.0 million generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.24, versus $0.21 for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 14.3%. Record first quarter net sales of $59.9 million were approximately 13.1% greater than the $53.0 million result of the prior year comparable quarter.
Detailing this first quarter of 2010, sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were a record $10.0 million, which was a 20% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. The domestic and international food sectors were up again this quarter, as we saw solid double digit growth of encapsulated ingredients for baking, preservation and confection markets. In the quarter, we also realized double digit growth of our human choline products globally, as we continue to target new food applications, and we also experienced a rebound in the supplement markets. These results were partially offset by slowness in sales of our calcium products and a slight decline in quarterly sales of our VitaShure products for nutritional enhancement. Earnings from operations for this segment were a record $2.0 million, as compared to $1.0 million in the prior year comparable quarter, with gross margin levels improving, largely due to a 9.2% improvement in sales volume as well as improved product mix.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH), including specialties, choline and industrial derivative product sales, totaled $40.3 million, an increase of 12.2%, or $4.4 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Global feed grade choline product sales grew approximately 1.2% over the prior year quarter. Sales of choline products sourced from our Italian operation into the European and other international poultry markets improved 4.8%. Within the North American poultry production market, levels have stabilized and are forecasted to improve slightly over the balance of 2010. The ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to the ruminant and companion animal markets, realized 24.1% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter, as some regional improvement in dairy economics supported greater demand for these products, particularly with strong sales of Reashure, Nitroshure, Chelated Minerals and Aminoshure-L, our rumen protected lysine. Sales of industrial grade derivatives realized 43.9% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter and improved approximately 19.5% on a sequential basis.  Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased to $5.2 million as compared to $5.0 million in the prior year comparable quarter.  This quarterly earnings result reflects unfavorable increases in certain petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline. Price increases have been, and will be, implemented where we are contractually able to do so in the second quarter, as certain products continue to be affected by these higher costs.
 
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated record quarterly sales of $9.7 million, an increase of 9.9% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally a result of an increase in volumes sold in the quarter. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $3.3 million were essentially flat with the prior year comparable quarter as the benefits of increased sales volumes were offset by higher petro-chemical based raw material costs, and increased expenses related to development work on our ERC technology for repackaging, distribution and delivery of a product for the fruit ripening industry. Starting in the second quarter, we did increase prices to help off-set certain of the raw material cost increases. We continue to monitor petro-chemical raw material price escalation and if continued, would seek to adjust prices within contractual guidelines.
Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 improved approximately 6.8% to $17.4 million, as compared to $16.3 million for the prior year comparable period. This increase was principally a result of increased sales; however, the normally expected correlating margin improvement was partially offset by an unfavorable product mix and increases in certain key raw material costs. Margin percentage declined to 29.1% of sales as compared to 30.8% of sales in the prior year comparative period, but did show improvement on a sequential basis. We continue to focus on volume growth of our human and animal health products into export markets, capitalizing on our varied choline production capabilities, and new product launches. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $6.9 million was basically flat with the prior year comparable quarter, as some modest increase of employee headcount, other payroll related expenses, and increased investment in R&D were offset by lower General & Administrative expenses.
The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with $68.0 million in net working capital.  Our cash balance was $51.4 million on March 31, 2010, up from $46.4 million at December 31, 2009. During the first quarter, we paid our annual dividend which totaled $3.1 million and total debt was reduced to $6.0 million. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, combined with the noted improved operating results, drove strong cash flow generation for the quarter ended March 31, 2010.
 
 
 
Commenting on 2010, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem said, This record first quarter continues to reflect strong performances across all of Balchems segments demonstrating the value of our diversified base of business and our ability to leverage cross-business integration opportunities. Our growing global presence helped to off-set softness in certain U.S. markets and while raw material costs had a negative impact on certain segments, we continue to closely monitor all key economic drivers, stay customer solution focused, and take appropriate actions to generate solid operating margins and cash flow.
Signs of an improving economy are being very closely tracked with cautious optimism. Ongoing volatility in the global economy is still expected, but we believe 2010 will be a year of solid improvements in sales and earnings. We have de-bottlenecked production capabilities, and continue to leverage our existing business and research resources to launch new, innovative products through each of our business segments. We expect improved results in the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment, particularly in the choline and global food markets. The Animal Nutrition & Health segment is realizing significant volume growth of its specialty products, and choline grade derivatives are expected to continue strong double digit growth. The ARC Specialty Products segment should continue its steady earnings and revenue growth from its current base, as well as the development of new market opportunities for specialized delivery of certain gases. Our strong balance sheet continues to position us with the ability to capitalize on other strategic opportunities to broaden our global footprint."

Record Quarterly Earnings
 For the quarter ended June 30, 2010, the company achieved record net earnings of $8.3 million as compared to $6.9 million for the prior year comparable period, an increase of $1.5 million, or 21.4%. Second quarter net sales of $61.5 million were approximately 16.0% greater than the $53.0 million result of the prior year comparable quarter. The $8.3 million net earnings generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.28, versus $0.24 for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 16.7%.
With all three segments exhibiting strong double digit sales growth for the quarter, sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were particularly strong, setting a new quarterly record of $10.6 million, which was a 16.4% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. The domestic food sector was up again this quarter, as we continued solid double digit growth of encapsulated ingredients for baking, preservation and confection markets. We also realized double digit growth of our human choline products globally, as we converted new food applications, and also experienced a rebound in the supplement markets. These strong sales results were partially offset by a decline in sales of our calcium and VitaShure products; however, segment earnings were a record $2.8 million, as compared to $1.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Gross margin levels improved, largely due to improved sales volumes, product mix and plant efficiencies.
Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH), including specialties, choline and industrial derivative product sales, totaled $40.7 million, an increase of 16.8%, or $5.9 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Our global feed grade choline product sales were essentially flat with the prior year quarter; however, our North American choline sales improved, as did the North American broiler meat production market, which improved 2.6% over the prior year quarter and is expected to be up 2-3% in the second half of 2010. Exports of liquid and dry choline from our North American plants declined in the quarter as rising raw material costs, in combination with global competition, resulted in our declining to bid on certain international business in the quarter. Sales statistics in this segment were also negatively impacted by approximately 2.0% due to correlated foreign currency fluctuation associated with the Italian operation. The ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to the ruminant and companion animal markets, realized 11.4% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter, as some regional improvement in dairy economics supported greater demand for these products, particularly with strong sales of Aminoshure-L, our rumen protected lysine. Sales of industrial grade products realized significant growth from the prior year comparable quarter and improved approximately 29.5% on a sequential basis, as we saw continued improvement in sales for various industrial applications, predominantly in North America, but also in Europe.  Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased to $6.0 million as compared to $5.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter.  This quarterly earnings result reflects favorable operating variances due to the overall 14% volume improvement in sales.
 
 
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated record quarterly sales of $10.2 million, an increase of 12.4% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of an increase in volumes sold, largely propylene oxide in support of the recent acquisition of Aberco, Inc., which targets nut meat fumigation. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $3.6 million declined 3.5% from the prior year comparable quarter as the benefits of increased sales volumes were offset by higher petro-chemical based raw material costs, expenses related to development work on our ERC technology for repackaging of a product for the fruit ripening industry, and the noted acquisition. In the second quarter, we did realize modest price increases to help off-set certain of the raw material cost increases, incurred through the first quarter. We continue to closely monitor petro-chemical raw material costs and will seek to reflectively adjust prices within contractual guidelines.
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 improved approximately 10.5% to $19.1 million, as compared to $17.3 million for the prior year comparable period. This increase was principally a result of increased sales; however, the expected correlating margin improvement was partially offset by additional increases in certain key raw material costs, as we had to deal with a force majeure event from a key supplier. Margin percentage declined to 31.1% of sales as compared to 32.7% of sales in the prior year comparative period, but did show 2.0% improvement on a sequential basis. We continue to leverage our plant capabilities, driving efficiencies from volume growth, new product launches of our human and animal health specialty products into the domestic and international markets, as well as capitalizing logistically on our varied choline production capabilities. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $6.7 million were down from the prior year comparable quarter as modest increased expenses, particularly related to the Aberco acquisition, were offset by a reduction in outside contract research, principally due to the timing of these activities, and reversal of accounts receivable reserves for international accounts that were an expense/reserve item in the prior year comparable quarter.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, consolidated net sales have increased 14.5% to $121.4 million versus the $106.0 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 18.5% to $15.4 million, generating $0.52 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $13.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period, an earnings per share improvement of 15.6%.
The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with $77.1 million in net working capital.  Our cash balance was $50.4 million on June 30, 2010, up from $46.4 million at December 31, 2009, and reflects payment for the noted acquisition in June. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, combined with the noted improved operating results, drove strong cash flow generation for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, even as we incurred $7.1 million of capital and acquisition expenditures.
Commenting on 2010, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem said, This record second quarter earnings result reflects strong performances across all of Balchems segments. Our diversified base of business and continued ability to leverage cross-business integration opportunities, in support of organic growth and acquisition opportunities, has continued to generate exceptional results. Our growing global presence continues to off-set softness in certain U.S. markets and while raw material costs had a slight negative impact on certain segments, we continue to closely monitor all key economic drivers, stay customer solution focused, and take appropriate actions to generate solid operating margins and cash flow.
Signs of an improving global economy are being closely tracked with cautious optimism. Ongoing volatility is still expected, but we believe 2010 will continue to be a year of solid improvements in sales and earnings. We have de-bottlenecked certain production capabilities, continuing to leverage existing sites and are investing in new commercial encapsulation technology for our animal health specialty business.  Research resources are focused on developing new, innovative products for each of our business segments. We expect continued improved results in the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment. Industrial choline derivatives are expected to continue strong double digit growth, and the ARC Specialty Products segment should improve its earnings based on revenue growth from its current base, as well as the development of new market opportunities for packaged gases. Our strong balance sheet continues to position us with the ability to capitalize on other strategic opportunities to broaden our technologies and global footprint."

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 
New Record Quarterly Results for Sales and Earnings
of $63.9 million were achieved for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.  This is an increase of 17.7% above the $54.3 million result of the prior year quarter. Accordingly, for the quarter were $8.5 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 23.9% as compared with the same period last year. The $8.5 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.29 per common share versus $0.24 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 20.8%.
Record net sales
record net earnings
With all three segments exhibiting strong double digit sales growth for the quarter, sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were particularly strong, setting another new quarterly record of $10.7 million, which was a 23.8% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. The domestic and international food sectors were up again this quarter, as we continued solid double digit growth of encapsulated ingredients for baking, preservation and confection markets. We also realized double digit growth of our human choline products globally, as we continue to experience growth in the supplement markets and increased inclusion in food products. These strong results were partially offset by a decline in sales of our calcium and VitaShure products; however, segment earnings were very strong at $2.5 million, as compared to $1.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter. Total gross margin as a percent of sales increased to 31.7% from 30.2% in the third quarter of 2009, reflecting improved sales volumes, product mix and plant efficiencies.
&# 174;
Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH), including specialties, choline and industrial derivative product sales, totaled $42.4 million, an increase of 16.1%, or $5.9 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Our global feed grade choline product sales grew approximately 3%, largely due to improved sales of our Italian produced choline sold into markets outside of North America. North American choline sales into the poultry and swine markets did improve slightly as well, even as the US broiler meat production forecast for the third quarter did not meet industry expectations. The new US broiler meat production forecast for all of 2010 is now projecting an increase of 2.4% from the previous year according to the USDA's Economic Research Service. Exports of liquid and dry choline from our North America n plants declined in the quarter largely due to currency issues and, in combination with global competition, resulted in our declining to bid on certain international business in the quarter.  Comparative sales statistics in this segment were negatively impacted by approximately 3.1% due to correlated foreign currency fluctuation associated with the Italian operation. The ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to the ruminant and companion animal markets, was flat with the prior year comparable quarter.  Some regional improvement in dairy economics supported greater demand for certain products, particularly sales of Aminoshure-L, our rumen protected lysine, and Reashure. These improved sales were however offset by a decline in sales of our Chelated Mineral products, principally into the international market. Sales of industrial grade products again realized significant growth from the prior yea r comparable quarter and comprise approximately 28% of the sales in this segment for the quarter. We continued to realize improvement in sales for various industrial applications, predominantly in North America as international industrial sales were essentially flat with the prior year quarter.  Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased to a new record of $6.1 million as compared to $5.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter.  This quarterly earnings result particularly reflects favorable operating variances due to an overall 12% volume improvement in sales.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC) 
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $10.8 million, an increase of 18.6% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of an increase in volumes sold, largely propylene oxide in support of the recent acquisition of Aberco, Inc., which targets nut meat and spice fumigation. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $4.5 million improved 20.9% from the prior year comparable quarter. In the second quarter, we did realize modest price increases to help off-set certain raw material cost increases incurred through the first half of 2010.
record
Consolidated gross profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 improved to $20.2 million, as compared to $16.4 million for the prior year comparable period. This $3.8 million increase was principally a result of an 11% increase in sales volumes. This margin improvement was partially offset by increases in certain key raw material costs, as we had to deal with a force majeure event from a key supplier. Margin percentage did increase to 31.7% of sales as compared to 30.2% in the prior year comparative period, and showed improvement on a sequential basis. We continue to leverage our plant capabilities, driving efficiencies from core volume growth, new product launches of our human and animal health specialty products into both the domestic and international markets, as well as capitalizing logistically on our varied choline production capabilities. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.2 million were up from the prior year comparable quarter, particularly related to the Aberco acquisition, recruiting fees, relocation expenses, and consultancy fees.
 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, consolidated net sales have increased 15.6% to $185.3 million versus the $160.3 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 20.4% to $23.9 million, generating $0.81 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $19.8 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period, an earnings per share improvement of 17.4%.
The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with $89.8 million in net working capital.  Our cash balance was $65.4 million on September 30, 2010, up from $46.4 million at December 31, 2009, and reflects payment for the noted Aberco acquisition in June. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, combined with the noted improved operating results, drove strong cash flow generation, even as we have incurred $10.7 million of capital and acquisition expenditures in 2010.
Commenting on 2010, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem said, These record setting third quarter sales and earnings results reflect strong performances across all of Balchems segments. Our diversified base of business, continued ability to leverage cross-business integration capabilities, in support of both organic and acquisition growth, has continued to generate exceptional results. Our growing global presence, though tempered somewhat by softness in certain U.S. markets and unfavorable currency fluctuations, generated solid operating margins and cash flow.  Raw material costs had a slight negative impact on certain segments, but we continue to closely monitor all key economic and competitive forces to deliver quality produ ct value to our customer base.
While signs of an improving global economy in the markets we serve reflect ongoing volatility, we believe 2010 will continue to be a year of solid improvements in sales and earnings, meeting our strategic objectives for the year. We have, and continue to, de-bottleneck certain production capabilities, leveraging existing production and logistic sites. We are
investing in new commercial encapsulation technology for our animal health specialty business, which should be operational quarter one, 2011.  Research resources are focused on developing new, innovative products for each of our business segments. We expect continued improved results in the food & nutrition sectors. Industrial choline derivatives are expected to continue strong double digit growth, and the ARC Specialty Products segment should improve based on revenue growth from its current base, as well as the development of new market opportunities for packaged gases. Our strong balance sheet and diversified revenue base continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to capitalize on both organic and other strategic opportunities and continue to create superior returns.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
New Record Quarterly and Annual Results for Sales and Earnings
of $69.8 million were achieved for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, as all three business segments set new quarterly sales records.  This is an increase of 17.9% above the $59.2 million result of the prior year comparative quarter. Correspondingly, were achieved for the quarter of $9.4 million, an increase of $2.5 million, or 35.2% as compared with the same period last year. The $9.4 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.31 per common share versus $0.24 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 29.2%.
Record net sales
record net earnings
Detailing this fourth quarter of 2010, sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were a record $10.7 million, which was a 14.7% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. The domestic and international food sectors continued solid double digit growth of encapsulated ingredients for baking, prepared food, preservation and confection markets. We also realized double digit growth in sales of our human choline and VitaShure products for nutritional enhancement.  These positive results were partially offset by a decline in sales of our calcium carbonate products. Earnings from operations for this segment were a fourth quarter record of $2.5 million, as compared to $1.4 million in the prior year comparable quarter, with gross margin levels improving, largely due to a 12.8% improvement in sales volume as well as improved product mix.
The Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative product sales, totaled a $47.5 million, an increase of 17.5%, or $7.1 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Our global feed grade choline product sales were up modestly from the prior year quarter, even as we allowed exports of liquid and dry choline to decline slightly due to currency issues in combination with global competition. However, we did experience a 9.2% increase on a sequential quarterly basis, as data from USDA's Broiler Hatchery report, which tracksthe number of broiler chicks placed and eggs set, points toward continued gains in both , forecasting even higher in early 2011. Comparative sales statistics in this segment were also negatively impacted by approximately 1.9% due to foreign currency fluctuation associated with the European operation. The ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to the ruminant and companion animal markets, realized approximately 28% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter, as certain regional improvement in dairy economics supported greater demand for these products. Particularly strong were sales of Reashure choline, chelated minerals and Aminoshure-L, our rumen protected lysine.  Sales of industrial grade products again realized significant growth from the prior year comparable quarter, comprising approximately 26% of the sales in this segment for the quarter. This improvement came from sales of various choline and ch oline derivatives for industrial applications, notably from natural gas fracking as well as intermediate sales of our Italian- produced methylamines.  Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased to a new quarterly record of $6.8 million as compared to $5.9 million in the prior year comparable quarter.  This quarterly earnings result particularly reflects favorable operating efficiencies due to an overall 14% volume improvement in sales.
record
 
 
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $11.5 million, an increase of 23.2% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of strong sales of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and increased volumes of propylene oxide in support of the recent acquisition of Aberco, Inc., which targets nut meat and spice fumigation. Record earnings from operations for this segment, at $4.6 million improved 33.0% from the prior year comparable quarter. These results reflect modest price increases, implemented during the year to help off-set certain raw material cost increases, improved operating efficiencies due to volume, and a favorable product mix.
record
 
 
 
 
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2010 improved to $21.3 million, as compared to $17.0 million for the prior year comparable period as margin percentage increased to 30.5% of sales as compared to 28.7% in the prior year comparative period. The $4.3 million increase was principally a result of a 14% increase in sales volumes. We continue to leverage our plant capabilities, driving efficiencies from core volume growth, new product launches of our human and animal health specialty products into both the domestic and international markets, as well as capitalizing logistically on our varied choline production capabilities. We are also making strategic investments in our manufacturing facilities as required to keep pace with the growing demand for certain products. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Admi nistrative) expenses at $7.5 million were up 20% from the prior year comparable quarter, particularly related to an increase of employee headcount, other payroll related expenses, recruiting and consultancy fees, but were only up 3% sequentially.
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2010, consolidated net sales increased 16.2% to a record $255.1 million versus the $219.4 million in the comparable prior year period, with all three segments contributing double digit growth. Record net earnings increased 24.2% to $33.3 million, generating $1.12 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $26.8 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period, reflecting an earnings per share improvement of 20.4%.
The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, and realized $100 million in net working capital on December 31, 2010.  Our cash balance of $77.3 million at year end, up from $46.4 million at December 31, 2009, reflects strong cash flows net of $12.2 million for capital expenditures and the previously noted Aberco acquisition in June.
Commenting on 2010, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem said, These record setting fourth quarter sales and earnings results clearly reflect strong performances from all of Balchems segments. Our evolving, diversified base of businesses, continue to strategically leverage cross-business integration capabilities, in support of organic, new product line extensions, and acquisition growth, leading to exceptional results. Growing global presence, though tempered somewhat by unfavorable currency fluctuations, continued to fuel solid operating margins and cash flow.  While raw material costs in the quarter had a slight negative impact on certain segments sequentially, we aggressively managed the controllable factors to deliver quality and product value to our customer base.
With signs of improving global economies, the markets we serve do reflect ongoing volatility, but we believe 2011 will continue to be a year of solid improvements in sales and earnings, meeting our strategic organic growth objectives for the year. We will continue to de-bottleneck/expand certain production capabilities, leverage existing production and logistic sites, and invest in new commercial technology to support our business platforms.  Research resources are focused on developing new, innovative products for each of our business segments. We expect improved results in the food & nutrition sectors, and strong double digit growth in ANH Specialties and industrial choline derivatives. The ARC Specialty Products segment should improve based on revenue growth from its current base, as well as the development of new mar ket opportunities for packaged gases. Our strong balance sheet and noted diversified revenue base continue to provide us with a projection of financial strength, and flexibility, to capitalize on organic and strategic opportunities to create superior returns in 2011.

99.1           Press Release of Balchem Corporation, dated May 3, 2011, reporting its financial results for the first quarter of 2011.

Exhibit 99.1
Record Quarterly Sales
Record net sales of $73.0 million were achieved for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, as two of our business segments set new quarterly sales records.  This is an increase of 21.9% above the $59.9 million result of the prior year comparative quarter. Correspondingly, record first quarter net earnings were achieved of $8.9 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 26.8% as compared with the same period last year. The $8.9 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.30 per common share versus $0.24 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 25.0%.
In this first quarter of 2011, sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were a record $11.0 million, which was a 10.7% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. The domestic and international food sector sales were up approximately 9% this quarter, as we again saw growth of encapsulated ingredients for baking, prepared food, preservation and confection markets. We also realized double digit growth in sales of our human choline and VitaShure products for nutritional enhancement. Earnings from operations for this segment were a first quarter record of $2.5 million, versus the $2.0 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to a 12% improvement in sales volume.
 
 
 
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
 
The Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative product sales, totaled a quarterly $50.7 million, an increase of 25.9%, or $10.4 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Our global feed grade choline product sales were up double digit as volume increased, particularly from our Italian operation, over the prior year quarter. Data from USDA's Broiler Hatchery report, which tracksthe number of broiler chicks placed and eggs set, continues to point toward gains in 2011, although recent forecasted improvements were decreased slightly as poultry integrators have slowed the placement of chicks in an attempt to lower inventory levels and raise prices enough to cover the large increases that have occurred in both feed and energy costs. The ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to the ruminant animal markets, realized approximately 26% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter, as regional US and certain export countries showed improvement in dairy economics, supporting greater demand for these products. Particularly strong were sales of Aminoshure-L, our rumen protected lysine. Sales of industrial grade products again realized significant growth from the prior year comparable quarter, comprising approximately 28% of the sales in this segment for the quarter. This improvement came from sales of various choline and choline derivatives for industrial applications, notably from natural gas fracking, as well as intermediate sales of our Italian-produced methylamines. Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased approximately 23% to a new quarterly record of $6.4 million as compared to $5.2 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This quarterly earnings result particularly reflects favorable operating efficiencies due to an overall 21% volume improvement in sales. These earnings were, however, unfavorably impacted by increases in petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline, and a temporary operating inefficiency at one of our choline plants. Key raw materials rose at a very swift pace in the quarter, and while some increases were passed on to customers, our pricing initiatives in the quarter were not enough to offset all of the cost increasesAdditional price increases have been, and will be, implemented in the second quarter, where we are contractually able to do so, as our businesses are likely to remain affected by these higher costs for the balance of 2011.
record
 
.
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $11.3 million, an increase of 16.8% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of strong sales of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and propylene oxide in support of the recent acquisition of the Aberco business, which targets nut meat and spice fumigation. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $4.4 million improved 32.1% from the prior year comparable quarter, due to efficiencies from increased volumes and a favorable product mix, which were partially offset by increases in key petro-chemical commodities. We continue to monitor raw material price escalation and seek to implement price increases within contractual guidelines.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 improved to $20.8 million, as compared to $17.4 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage declined slightly to 28.5% of sales as compared to 29.1% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to the cost increases of certain key raw materials and the choline plant inefficiency, as mentioned above. We did, however, realize a $3.4 million increase after giving effect to these cost increases, which was principally a result of a 20% increase in sales volumes. We continue to leverage our plant capabilities, driving efficiencies from core volume growth, broadening product applications of our human and animal health specialty products into both the domestic and international markets, as well as capitalizing logistically on our varied choline production capabilities. We continue to make strategic technology and capacity investments in our manufacturing facilities as required to keep pace with the growing, sustainable demand for certain products. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.5 million were sequentially flat with the fourth quarter of 2010, but up 8.1% from the prior year comparable quarter, particularly related to increased amortization expense related to the Aberco acquisition, an increase of employee headcount, other payroll related expenses and consultancy fees.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management. The $111 million of net working capital on March 31, 2011 included a cash balance of $82.1 million, up from $77.3 million at December 31, 2010, reflecting continued strong cash flows. During the first quarter, we also paid our annual dividend which totaled $4.3 million and, as mentioned above, made further capital investments in our plants totaling $1.8 million.
Commenting on 2011, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, President and CEO of Balchem said, This first quarter was a great start to 2011, as we continue to record very strong sales growth, particularly driven by 20% overall volume improvement from the first quarter of 2010. All three segments set new first quarter sales records, with ANH and FPN achieving new all-time record quarterly results. While we realized a slight decline in gross margin percentage due to escalating raw materials and a particular operating plant inefficiency, know that we have taken appropriate corrective actions. We continue to see strong global demand for our products and are leveraging off of our diverse production locations and strong supply chain logistics to maintain and grow our leadership positions.  We have completed the previously announced expansion of our choline capacity at St. Gabriel in this second quarter, and will soon launch a new/improved encapsulate product for the ANH market. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen, further positioning us to capitalize on global strategic opportunities.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
Record Quarterly Results for Sales and Earnings
Record net sales of $74.7 million were achieved for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, as two of our business segments set quarterly sales records.  This is an increase of 21.5% above the $61.5 million result of the prior year comparative quarter. Correspondingly, record quarter net earnings were achieved of $9.6 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 14.8% as compared with the same period last year. The $9.6 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.32 per common share versus $0.28 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 14.3%.
In this second quarter of 2011, sales of the Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative product sales, totaled a quarterly record $51.8 million, an increase of 27.3% or $11.1 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Our global feed grade choline product sales were up double digit, a result of increased volumes sold from our North American operations to both domestic and international customers and increases in selling price, partially offsetting raw material cost increases. Data from USDA Broiler statistics and market conditions now project that broiler chick placements and egg sets will be slightly lower for the second half of 2011, as poultry integrators continue to see weak prices and demand from the domestic food service and retail markets served. Export opportunities are expected to remain stable for this same period.  The ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to the ruminant animal markets, realized approximately 25% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter, as regional US and certain export markets showed improvement in dairy economics, supporting greater demand for these products. Particularly strong were sales of Reashure, Nitroshure and Aminoshure-L, our rumen protected lysine.  Sales of industrial grade products again realized significant growth from the prior year comparable quarter, and comprised approximately 35% of the sales in this segment for the quarter. This improvement came from sales of various choline and choline derivatives for industrial applications, including natural gas fracking, as well as intermediate sales of our Italian-produced methylamines. Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased approximately 12% to a quarterly record of $6.7 million as compared to $6.0 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This quarterly earnings result reflects favorable operating efficiencies due to an overall 16% volume improvement in sales; however, unfavorably impacted by increases in petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline. Key raw materials again rose at a very swift rate during the quarter, outpacing our pricing initiatives. Additional price increases have been implemented in the third quarter, as our products are likely to remain affected by these higher costs for the balance of 2011.
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated record quarterly sales of $12.0 million, an increase of 17.6% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of strong volumes of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and propylene oxide in support of the June 2010 acquisition of the Aberco business, which targets nut meat and spice fumigation. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $4.5 million, improved 25.5% from the prior year comparable quarter due to operating efficiencies from increased volumes and a favorable product mix, which were also partially offset by increases in petro-chemical commodities.
Sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were $10.9 million, which was a modest 3.0% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. In the quarter, we did realize double digit growth in sales of our human choline products for nutritional enhancement. Food sector sales remained strong with steady sales of encapsulated ingredients for baking, prepared food, preservation and confection markets.  Most notably, sales on a comparative basis were unfavorably impacted by the previously announced decision to sell our calcium product line.   Earnings from operations for this segment were $2.8 million which was even with the prior year quarter, but up 13% sequentially from the first quarter of 2011.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 improved to $21.8 million, as compared to $19.1 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage declined slightly to 29.1% of sales as compared to 31.1% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to the previously mentioned raw material cost increases. We did, however, realize a $2.6 million increase, which was principally a result of a 15.4% increase in consolidated sales volumes after giving effect to these cost increases. We continue to leverage our plant capabilities, driving efficiencies from core volume growth, broadening product applications of our human and animal health specialty products into both the domestic and international markets, as well as capitalizing logistically on our varied manufacturing and warehousing capabilities. Enhancing strategic technology and capacity investments in our manufacturing facilities as required, facilitates the growing, sustainable demand for certain products. During the quarter, we successfully completed the de-bottlenecking of our feed grade choline production capacity in St. Gabriel, Louisiana and Verona, Missouri, which are both currently producing at the expected increased levels.  Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.7 million were up 15.4% from the prior year comparable quarter, particularly related to increased amortization expense related to the Aberco acquisition, an increase of employee headcount, other payroll related expenses and consultancy fees incurred to study acquisition opportunities. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales, however, did decline to 10.3% from 10.9% in the prior year quarter and expenses were only up 3% sequentially.
The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management. The $125 million of net working capital on June 30, 2011 included a cash balance of $89.7 million, up from $77.3 million at December 31, 2010, reflecting continued strong cash flows.
Commenting on these second quarter results, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, CEO and President of Balchem said, The second quarter results continue to reflect a strong, diversified yet balanced growth platform. While all three segments did not achieve record levels, overall volume growth of 15% drove very exciting top line growth. Escalating raw material costs continue to be a challenge, but our methodology of actively advising customers about new pricing is working well. This has led to some margin erosion near-term, but we continue to aggressively negotiate raw material sourcing and position to ultimately recapture the previous levels. The volume growth has helped generate on-going plant efficiencies, efficiencies required to meet strong growing global demand for our products. In quarter three, we will be launching a couple of new enhanced products for ANH Specialties, based on new innovative process technology. These products were developed in response to the marketplace need for more bio-available, economically effective products. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen as we study strategic opportunities to effectively leverage this asset for the continued growth of all segments.

Record Quarterly Results for Earnings
For the third quarter ended September 30, 2011, the company achieved of $10.8 million, an increase of $2.3 million, or 27.0% over the prior year comparative quarter. The $10.8 million generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.36 versus $0.29 for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 24.1%.  Net sales of $74.4 million were achieved for the quarter which is an increase of 16.5% above the $63.9 million result of the prior year comparative quarter.
record net earnings
In this third quarter of 2011, sales of the Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative product sales, totaled $51.2 million, an increase of 20.9% or $8.8 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Our global feed grade choline product sales were up double digit, principally a result of increased volumes sold from our North American operations to both domestic and especially international customers, along with increases in selling price which partially offset raw material cost increases. We continue to contest raw material price escalation; however, where necessary, we implement price increases within contractual guidelines. While the number of chick placements for U.S. broiler meat production in the quarter was down from a year earlier, average live bird weights were much higher than during the same period in 2010. Data from USDA Broiler statistics project that broiler chick placements and egg sets will be lower for the comparative fourth quarter due to continued high grain prices, along with only minor improvements in the domestic economy. Export sales are expected to remain stable for the balance of the year. ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to the ruminant animal markets, realized approximately 26% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter, as regional US and certain export markets showed improvement in dairy economics, supporting greater volume demand for these products despite relatively high feed prices. Particularly strong were sales of Reashure, Nitroshure and Aminoshure-L, our rumen protected lysine.  Sales of industrial grade products again realized significant growth from the prior year comparable quarter, and comprised approximately 31% of the sales in this segment for the quarter. This improvement came from sales of various choline and choline derivatives for industrial applications, including natural gas fracking, as well as intermediate sales of our Italian-produced methylamines. Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased approximately 21% to a quarterly record of $7.3 million as compared to $6.1 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to improved volumes sold. In this quarter, due to the traditional European summer holiday schedule, our results reflect unfavorable manufacturing variances at our Italian facility. Production in this facility has now returned to normalized levels.
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated record quarterly sales of $12.2 million, an increase of 12.8% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of strong volumes of ethylene oxide sold for medical device sterilization. Propylene oxide sales, particularly for nutmeat fumigation, also continued to show steady, improving revenue growth. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $4.7 million, improved 5.0% from the prior year comparable quarter, as the benefits of the increased volumes sold of ethylene oxide were partially offset by continued increases in petro-chemical commodities.
Sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were $11.0 million, which was a modest 2.8% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. In the quarter, we realized double digit growth in sales of our human choline products for nutritional enhancement. Food sector sales, while shy of our prior year results, did increase sequentially from quarter two, with steady sales of encapsulated ingredients for baking, prepared food, preservation and confection markets, particularly into international markets. Earnings from operations for this segment increased approximately 27.6% to a quarterly record of $3.2 million, reflecting a favorable product mix and the favorable earnings impact of our previously announced decision to sell the calcium product line.

Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 improved to $22.6 million, as compared to $20.2 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage declined slightly to 30.4% of sales as compared to 31.7% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to the previously mentioned raw material cost increases. We did, however, realize a $2.4 million increase, which was principally a result of increased sales volumes and sequentially we have improved our margin by 1.2 percentage points, as we continue to leverage our plant capabilities, driving supply chain efficiencies and broadening product applications of our human and animal health specialty products into both the domestic and international markets.  During the quarter, in response to growing demand for encapsulated ANH specialty ingredients, we successfully introduced two products developed with a new encapsulation technology.  This new manufacturing technology is expected to lower our overall cost for certain products, facilitate higher throughput in our ANH encapsulation process and reduce the production animal dosage cost to herd managers.  Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.4 million were up 3.1% from the prior year comparable quarter; however, they did decline as a percentage of sales to 10.0% from 11.3% in the prior year quarter. Our effective income tax rates for the third quarters of 2011 and 2010 were 29.2% and 34.4%, respectively. The decrease in our effective rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 was principally a result of favorable adjustments related to changes in state income tax apportionment and increases in certain tax credits.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, consolidated net sales have increased 19.9% to $222.1 million versus $185.3 million in the comparable prior year period. Net earnings have increased 22.7% to $29.3 million, generating $0.97 per diluted share, versus net earnings of $23.9 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, in the prior year comparable period, an earnings per share improvement of 19.8%.
The company continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management. The $137.6 million of net working capital on September 30, 2011 included a cash balance of $104.9 million, up from $77.3 million at December 31, 2010, reflecting continued strong cash flows.
Commenting on these third quarter results, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, CEO and President of Balchem said, The third quarter results continue to reflect the robustness of our diversified, yet balanced, growth platforms. While all three segments did not achieve record levels, overall volume growth of 6%, combined with improved product mix, drove a very exciting 16.5% top line growth. Persistent escalation of raw material costs continue to be a challenge, but our supply chain efforts to minimize these increases and methodically advise customers about new pricing is working well. While these activities led to comparative quarter gross margin erosion, we did show sequential quarterly gross margin improvement. The volume growth generated ongoing plant efficiencies, efficiencies required to help meet our customer marketplace challenges and support the strong, growing global demand for our products. In this quarter, the launch of two new products for ANH Specialties, based on new innovative encapsulation technology, has gone very well, leading to the improved product mix noted earlier. These consolidated results continue to strengthen our balance sheet, which will facilitate both innovative organic and acquisitive growth objectives.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
 
Fourth quarter 2011 revenues were $69.7 million, effectively equal to the $69.8 million of the prior year comparable quarter, delivering an overall annual growth rate of 14.4% above the 2010 result. These quarterly results reflect particular strength in the ARC Specialty Products segment, unexpected softness in the domestic food sector of Food, Pharma & Nutrition (FPN) and mixed results from Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH), with significant improvement coming from the ruminant production animal sector, flatness from the poultry markets, which was then offset by softness in the industrial products end market.
Net earnings of $9.5 million for the quarter were also substantially equal to the $9.4 million of the prior year quarter, yielding diluted net earnings per share of $0.31, which is equal to the prior year comparable quarter. Full year earnings, however, achieved a new annual record of $38.8 million reflecting an increase of 16.5% versus 2010 and generating a 14.3% improvement to $1.28 per diluted share.
In this fourth quarter of 2011, sales of the Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including ruminant specialties, choline and industrial derivative products, totaled $47.8 million, an increase of $0.3 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Our ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to ruminant production animal markets, realized approximately 21% sales growth, principally from sales of Reashure, and our new Aminoshure products. Dairy economics in the US and certain export markets remain strong, supporting greater demand for these products despite relatively high feed prices. Our global feed grade choline product sales were equal to the prior year comparable quarter as volumes sold in these markets were strongly influenced by the dynamics of our customer base, predominantly the poultry production industry. As previously projected from USDA Broiler statistics, broiler chick placements and egg sets were lower for the fourth quarter due to continued high grain prices, along with only minor economic improvements in the North American poultry end markets. Higher selling prices, largely a result of continued raw material cost escalation, effectively offset lower volumes.  We continue to contest raw material price escalation; however, where necessary, we implemented price increases within contractual guidelines, but did realize some erosion in gross margins. Sales of industrial grade products were down approximately 11% from the prior year comparable quarter due to a number of variables. This decline correlates to a recent shift towards increased oil-directed drilling in the United States, as opposed to natural gas drilling, which does not have the same clay stabilization requirements. This redirection of rig utilization is largely due to natural gas prices trading at or near ten-year lows and high levels of natural gas inventory.  In addition, our success in this space has begun to attract competition from off-shore producers, which also contributed to the lower volumes sold. As a result of these various dynamics, earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment decreased to $6.0 million, as compared to $6.8 million in the prior year comparable quarter.
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated record quarterly sales of $12.3 million, an increase of 6.9% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was the result of strong volumes of ethylene oxide sold for medical device sterilization. Propylene oxide sales, particularly for nutmeat fumigation, also continued to show steady, improving revenue growth. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $5.0 million, improved 10.6% from the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to the benefits of the increased volumes sold of ethylene oxide.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
Sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were $9.6 million, which was a 10.6% decline from the prior year comparable quarter. While we did realize double digit growth in sales of our human choline products for nutritional enhancement, the food sector sales of encapsulated ingredients for prepared food, preservation and confection markets were particularly slow in the quarter as we saw soft demand from our base business and expected pipeline prospects which did not convert/ launch in the quarter to offset this soft demand. On an absolute quarterly comparative note, we also realized a decline of approximately $300,000 due to the fourth quarter 2010 disposition of the calcium product line. Earnings from operations for this segment did, however, increase by approximately 6.9% to $2.6 million, reflecting a favorable product mix and a favorable earnings impact from the discontinued operation of the calcium product line.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 was $20.8 million, as compared to $21.3 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage declined slightly to 29.9% of sales as compared to 30.5% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to lower sales volumes and the previously mentioned raw material cost increases. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.2 million were down 4.1% from the prior year comparable quarter, declining as a percentage of sales to 10.3% from 10.7% in the prior year quarter. Our effective income tax rates for the fourth quarters of 2011 and 2010 were 31.0% and 32.6%, respectively. The decrease in our effective rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 was a result of favorable adjustments related to changes in state income tax apportionment.
The company continues to maintain and grow a solid financial structure. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management contribute strongly to the business performance. The $144.8 million of net working capital on December 31, 2011 included a cash balance of $114.8 million, up from $77.3 million at December 31, 2010, net of $6.6 million in capital expenditures for 2011, reflecting continued strong cash flows.
Commenting further, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, CEO and President of Balchem said, The fourth quarter results continue to reflect the effectiveness of our diversified, yet balanced, growth platforms. While all three segments did not achieve record quarterly levels, all three did achieve record annual revenue and operating earnings levels. The 14% annual revenue growth of $37 million was realized by a near equal split of volume and prices.  Persistent escalation of raw material costs continues to be a challenge, but our supply chain efforts, along with improved volumes and product mix, generated a strong 16.5% growth in net earnings, year over year. Marketplace challenges continue to support mixed performance scenarios, but there is growing global demand for our products, as noted in this quarter, particularly with the new products for ANH Specialties and human choline, based on innovative technology and new scientific health claims. These consolidated results continue to strengthen our balance sheet, which will facilitate both innovative organic and acquisitive growth objectives, as we move into 2012.

The planned expansion will more than double output capacity for the Animal Nutrition and Health ruminant sector focusing on its new and improved encapsulation technology.
New Hampton, New York (April 30, 2012)
Balchem is a world class supplier of encapsulated nutrients and manufactures more than 140 different products across human, animal and industrial applications. Balchem has worked to refine and improve encapsulation technology and processes for more than 40 years, with keen focus in the Animal Nutrition and Health industry for the last 10 years.
The Virginia plant expansion, scheduled to be completed later this fall, is the result of broad market acceptance of Balchems growing portfolio of encapsulated nutrients; ReaShure Choline, AminoShure-L Lysine, AminoShure-M Methionine, NitroShure Urea and NiaShureNiacin.  The new plant complements the 2011 expansion of its Verona, Missouri plant and will leverage breakthrough manufacturing technologies that were developed and deployed there last summer.  The improved process streamlines manufacturing and expands the type of ingredients offered.  This location in Virginia provides direct access to major interstate highways, allowingBalchem to serve its growing domestic customer base easily, and has close port proximity to aid in serving its international business, as well.  This investment solidifies Balchems position as the world leader in encapsulation technology and precision nutrient delivery.
 
We are committed to serving our ever expanding customer base with high quality, industry leading encapsulated nutrients, said Dana Putnam, Vice President & General Manager of Balchem Animal Nutrition & Health. This new facility and our recent break-through process innovations provide cost effective solutions for greater producer profitability.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Balchem Corporation Announces First Quarter 2012 Results
Record Quarterly Sales
Record net sales of $76.2 million were achieved for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, as our Animal Nutrition and Health business segment set a new quarterly sales record.  This is an increase of 4.4% above the $73.0 million result of the prior year comparative quarter. Correspondingly, record first quarter net earnings were achieved of $9.3 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 4.0% as compared with the same period last year. The $9.3 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.31 per common share versus $0.30 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 3.3%.
In this first quarter of 2012, sales of the Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative products, totaled a quarterly $53.2 million, an increase of 5.0%, or $2.5 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Our ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to ruminant production animal markets, realized approximately 30% sales growth, principally from sales of Reashure, and our new Aminoshure products. Dairy economics in the US and certain export markets remain strong, supporting greater demand for these products despite increasing feed prices. To support this growth, plans for a new manufacturing facility in Alleghany County, Virginia were recently announced. The planned expansion will more than double output capacity for the Aminoshure products leveraging off of our new, innovative encapsulation technology. The Virginia plant expansion is scheduled to be commissioned later this fall.
record
 
 
 
 
 
Our global feed grade choline sales were down 4.9% from  the prior year comparable quarter as volumes sold, predominantly in the poultry production industry, track with broiler chick placements and egg sets, which were lower for the first quarter due to continued high grain prices and weak U.S. consumer demand.  The current 2012 USDA forecast forbroiler meat production is 1.7 percent lower than in 2011, representing a slight improvement from the prior forecast. With continued raw material price escalation, we did realize some erosion in gross margin for this product line given the previously noted economic issues of the end market. Sales of industrial grade products did rebound this quarter, improving 7.5% over the prior year comparable quarter, and on a sequential basis, improved 38%.  The sequential improvement came from sales of methylamines, derivatives and choline for industrial applications, including gas fracking, where slightly lower average selling prices in this first quarter were more than offset by improved volumes sold.   Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment were $6.2 million as compared to $6.4 million in the prior year comparable quarter, as key raw materials again rose at a swift rate during the quarter, outpacing our pricing initiatives. Price increases have been implemented in the second quarter, as our products are likely to remain affected by these higher costs for the balance of 2012.
 
 
  The ARC Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $12.3 million, an increase of 8.5% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of strong sales of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and propylene oxide for nut meat and spice fumigation. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $4.7 million improved 8.1% from the prior year comparable quarter, due to increased volumes and a favorable product mix, which were partially offset by increases in key petro-chemical raw materials. We continue to challenge raw material price escalation and/or seek to implement price increases within contractual guidelines.
Sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were $10.7 million, which was a 2.7% decline from the prior year comparable quarter, particularly due to a $0.2 million decline from the disposition of the calcium product line in late 2010. We again realized double digit growth in sales of our human choline products for nutritional enhancement, but we also realized a decline in the food sector of encapsulated ingredients for the prepared food, preservation and confection markets, which were soft compared to a very strong first quarter in 2011; however, food did show 2% growth on a sequential basis. Earnings from operations for this segment increased by approximately 7.8% to $2.7 million, reflecting a favorable product mix and a favorable earnings impact from the discontinued operation of the calcium product line.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 improved to $21.2 million, as compared to $20.8 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage declined slightly to 27.8% of sales as compared to 28.5% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to the previously mentioned raw material cost increases. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.5 million were flat with the prior year comparable quarter, declining as a percentage of sales to 9.8% from 10.2%. Our effective income tax rates for the first quarters of 2012 and 2011 were 32.3% and 33.4%, respectively. The decrease in our effective rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 was a result of favorable adjustments related to changes in state income tax apportionment.
The company continues to maintain and grow a solid financial structure. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management contribute strongly to the business performance. The $156.8 million of net working capital on March 31, 2012 included a cash balance of $121.3 million, up from $114.8 million at December 31, 2011. During the first quarter, we paid our annual dividend totaling $5.2 million, a 20% increase over the prior year dividend, and made further capital investments of $1.4 million in our plants.
 
 
 
 
Commenting further, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, CEO and President of Balchem said, The record quarterly sales result was achieved based on quality growth in two of our three segments, and reflects the value of our diversified portfolio. Even in the FPN segment, the key human choline product line again grew at double digit levels. Escalation of raw material costs has continued to dampen the otherwise expected improvement of profitability on the sales growth, but we continue to achieve plant efficiencies, logistics improvements and product mix enhancements to deliver approximately 18% earnings from operations. The export markets for feed grade choline continue to represent challenging economics, yet opportunity, as we recognize the growth projections for production animals in those certain markets. We see this quarter as a solid start to the year. With the strength of our balance sheet, we expect to continue our growth organically, and are well positioned to make both organic growth investments, as evidenced by the Virginia manufacturing facility acquisition, and to pursue acquisitions or joint ventures.

Item 7.01: Regulation FD.
Balchem Corporation (the Company) has decided to suspend sales of its AminoShure-L, 52% lysine (the Product). Although there are no safety concerns relating to the Product, recent research indicates that the lysine bioavailability of the Product is lower than originally projected and does not meet our internal expectations. Even though dairy nutritionists and producers have reported positive results when using the Product, we are taking this action to conduct additional research and aggressively pursue Product improvements. We will reintroduce the Product when it meets our performance standards, which may affect the timing of our recently announced Covington, Virginia expansion. The Companys first quarter 2012 sales of this Product were approximately $2,100,000 and were included in the Animal Nutrition and Health segment in our financial statements.

Record Quarterly Sales
 
Record net sales of $79.0 million were achieved for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, as all three of our business segments set new quarterly sales records.  This is an increase of 5.8% above the $74.7 million result of the prior year comparative quarter despite the adverse impact of currency translation which reduced net sales by approximately 2.3%. Correspondingly, record second quarter net earnings of $10.0 million were achieved, an increase of $0.4 million, or 4.2% as compared with the same period last year. The $10.0 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.33 per common share versus $0.32 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 3.1%.
In this second quarter of 2012, sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were a record $11.8 million, which was an 8.1% improvement over the prior year comparable quarter. We realized very strong double digit growth in sales of our human choline and Vitashure products for nutritional enhancement, but we also realized a comparative quarter decline in the food sector of encapsulated ingredients for the prepared food, preservation and confection markets, which were soft compared to a very strong second quarter in 2011. However, this food result is a 12.7% improvement on a sequential quarterly basis, as we are seeing more conversion of pipeline accounts. Earnings from operations for this segment increased by approximately 19.7% to $3.4 million, reflecting a favorable product mix and a favorable earnings impact of the previously noted discontinued calcium product line.
 
  The ARC Specialty Products segment also generated record quarterly sales of $12.5 million, an increase of 3.6% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of continued sales strength of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and of propylene oxide for nut meat and spice fumigation. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $4.8 million improved 6.8% from the prior year comparable quarter, due to increased volumes and a favorable product mix.
Sales of the Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative products, realized a quarterly record $54.8 million, an increase of 5.8%, or $3.0 million from the prior year comparable quarter. Product mix was significant in these results as our ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to ruminant production animal markets, realized approximately 36% sales growth, principally from sales of Reashure and our Aminoshure products. Dairy economics continue to support strong demand for these products despite the increasing challenges of production animal feed/ration prices. Forecasted higher feed prices in the second half of 2012 are expected to result in lower milk production due to ration changes but should support continued utilization of our products as herd managers will still look to maximize results of production animals. As mentioned in a previous press release, in order to support expected growth, a new manufacturing facility in Virginia is being constructed. This expansion will more than double output capacity for our rumen stable products and is scheduled to be commissioned later this fall. During the quarter, the Company announced a decision to suspend sales of its AminoShure-L, 52% lysine (the Product). There were no safety concerns relating to the Product; however, research indicated that the lysine bioavailability of the Product was lower than originally designed and projected, hence found to not meet our internal expectations. The negative impact of suspending this Product was approximately $1.0 million in the quarter, at the sales and earnings from operations levels.

Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
 
 
Our global feed grade choline sales were up 3.4% from the prior year comparable quarter, principally a result of higher average selling prices due to increasing raw material costs.  These cost increases did however begin to subside, but not until very late in the quarter. Choline volumes sold, which track closely with broiler chick placements and egg sets, were lower in North America in the second quarter due to continued high grain prices, weakness in U.S. consumer demand and exportation of finished birds.  Currently, the USDA forecast forbroiler meat production is for a less rapid recovery in the second half of 2012 and only slight growth in 2013. Sales of industrial grade products for fracking continue to be steady as sales were flat with the prior year quarter but, on a sequential basis, they improved 14%, particularly due to volume. Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment were $6.6 million as compared to $6.7 million in the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting the previously noted product mix factor as earnings were unfavorably impacted by the Product sales suspension discussed above, increases in key raw materials and choline demand levels of North American poultry producers, but did reflect a 5.6% improvement sequentially over the first quarter 2012.
 
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 improved to $22.6 million, as compared to $21.8 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage declined slightly to 28.6% of sales as compared to 29.1% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to the previously mentioned raw material cost increases and the Product sales suspension decision. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.8 million were flat with the prior year comparable quarter, declining as a percentage of sales to 9.8% from 10.3%. The other income decline of $294 on the quarterly comparative is primarily the result of the prior years second quarter net gain of $188 related to the sale of a non-core calcium carbonate product line and less favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) and functional foreign currencies. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was 32.7% and 33.3%, respectively. This decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a change in apportionment relating to state income taxes.
The company continues to maintain and grow a solid financial structure. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, contribute strongly to the business performance. The $168.3 million of net working capital on June 30, 2012 included a cash balance of $138.1 million, up from $114.8 million at December 31, 2011.
Commenting further, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, CEO and President of Balchem said, These record second quarter achievements are a result of our strong underlying focus on generating sustainable sales growth in each of our core business segments, and reflect the value of our diversified portfolio. Certain fluctuations of any particular product will occur, like our food encapsulates or feed grade choline, and the ANH Product suspension, but understanding why and staying focused on market trends allow us to respond to cautious actions by our customers in these economically challenging times. As previously noted, constant development of pipeline products, customers and prospects have continued to fuel the growth noted in this record quarter. We continue to focus on expense management, capitalizing on logistic opportunities of our production and distribution systems to deliver cost competitive or advantaged solutions to our customers. Our balance sheet has continued to strengthen, contributing to our strategic ability to also grow through acquisitions or partnership ventures.

On November 2, 2012, Balchem Corporation, reported earnings for its third quarter ended September 30, 2012. The full text of the press release issued in connection with the announcement is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Form 8-K (including Exhibit 99.1) shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
 
Record Quarterly Results
For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, the company achieved record third quarter net sales of $75.1 million, which is an increase of approximately 1% above the $74.4 million result of the prior year comparative quarter. The company also achieved of $10.9 million, an increase of approximately 1% over the prior year comparative quarter. The $10.9 million generated diluted net earnings per common share of $0.36, equal to the prior year comparable period.
record net earnings
In this third quarter of 2012, the Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative products, realized sales of $51.9 million, an increase of 1.3%, or $0.7 million over the prior year comparable quarter. Product mix was again significant in these results as our ANH specialty ingredients, largely targeted to ruminant production animal markets, realized approximately 25% sales growth, principally from sales of Reashure and Aminoshure products, as well as chelated minerals. Dairy economics continue to support strong demand for these products despite the challenges of production animal feed/ration prices. Milk prices are currently forecasted to remain strong, and the pace of dairy herd contraction is occurring at a slower rate than projected earlier in the year. Current feed and milk price indicators should support greater utilization of our products as nutritionists and herd managers look to continue to maximize results of production animals. As mentioned in a previous press release, a new manufacturing facility in Virginia is being constructed to support expected growth. This new facility will more than double output capacity for our rumen stable products and is scheduled to be commissioned late in the fourth quarter.
Our global feed grade choline sales were down 12.7% from the prior year comparable quarter. Choline volumes sold, which track closely with broiler chick placements and egg sets, were lower in North America in the third quarter due to continued high grain prices, demand weakness in the U.S., and lower exportation of finished birds. However, the current USDA forecast forbroiler meat production has improved slightly for the balance of 2012 due to a slightly lower forecast for feed prices. In addition, sales of our European produced product were unfavorably impacted by foreign currency fluctuations, approximating $0.9 million or a 3.4% decline in global feed grade choline sales. Sales of industrial grade products, including for fracking, were very strong as sales were up 13.6% over the prior year quarter and also improved on a sequential basis, particularly due to volume.
 
Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment were a record $8.1 million, an increase of 11% compared to $7.3 million in the prior year comparable quarter, reflecting the previously noted strong sales of specialty ingredient products in addition to a modest reduction in the cost of certain petro-chemical commodities. This result reflects unfavorable manufacturing variances from our Italian facility, due to the traditional European summer holiday schedule. This facility has now returned to normalized levels.
The ARC Specialty Products segment generated quarterly sales of $12.3 million, an increase of 1.0% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of continued sales strength of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization.  Sales of propylene oxide, in particular for industrial applications, were soft in the quarter, largely due to ordering patterns. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $5.2 million, did improve 12.1% from the prior year comparable quarter, due to a favorable product mix and a reduction in the cost of certain petro-chemical commodities.

Sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition segment were $10.9 million, effectively equal to the $11.0 million of the prior year comparable quarter. We realized continued strength in sales of our human choline products; however, we also realized a comparative quarter decline in the international food sector of encapsulated ingredients for the prepared food, preservation and confection markets, which had realized a particularly strong third quarter in 2011. Earnings from operations for this segment decreased by approximately 8.0%, or $0.25 million, to $2.9 million, reflecting an unfavorable product mix and slightly lower volumes sold.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 improved to $23.4 million, as compared to $22.6 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage improved slightly to 31.1% of sales as compared to 30.4% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to the previously mentioned raw material cost decreases and favorable product mix. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.2 million were down approximately 3.8% from the prior year comparable quarter, declining as a percentage of sales to 9.5% from 10.0%, as we continue to prudently exercise tight controls on these expenses. The other income decline of $78,000 on the quarterly comparative is primarily the result of the less favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar (the reporting currency) and functional foreign currencies. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 was 33.0% and 29.2%, respectively. This increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a change in apportionment relating to state income taxes and the expiration of the U.S. R&D tax credit.
The company continues to maintain and grow a solid financial structure. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, contribute strongly to the business performance. The $179.1 million of net working capital on September 30, 2012 included a cash balance of $147.2 million, up from $114.8 million at December 31, 2011, and reflects the early pay-down of the Italian long-term debt and capital expense funding of the Virginia site.
Commenting further, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, CEO and President of Balchem said, These record third quarter achievements are a reflection of strong underlying focus on generating sustainable sales growth in our core business segments, and the value of our diversified portfolio. As noted previously, certain fluctuations of any particular segment or product line will occur, like our food encapsulates or feed grade choline, which were neatly offset by continued strength in ANH Specialties, ARC and industrial grade products. Staying focused on macro-economic market trends allows us to respond to cautious actions by our customers in these economically challenging times, but also gives us insight to focus on development efforts of pipeline products and prospects. We continue to focus on operating expense management, new production and supply chain capabilities, including but not limited to logistics and currency, to deliver cost competitive or advantaged solutions to our customers. Our balance sheet has continued to strengthen, as we continue to seek out strategic acquisitions or partnership ventures to complement the organic growth.

Exhibit 99.1
Balchem Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter 2012 Results
 
 
 
 
Balchem Corporation (NASDAQ:BCPC)
 
 
Record Quarterly Sales & Net Earnings
For the quarter ended December 31, 2012, the company achieved record quarterly net sales of $80.1 million, which is an increase of approximately 15% above the $69.7 million result of the prior year comparative quarter. Record fourth quarter net earnings were achieved of $9.9 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 4.2% as compared with the same period last year. The $9.9 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.33 per common share versus $0.31 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 6.5%.
In this fourth quarter of 2012, the Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative products, realized record sales of $56.4 million, an increase of 18.1%, or $8.6 million over the prior year comparable quarter. Our global feed grade choline product sales were up 5.1% as volume increased 3.7%, particularly from our North American customer base, over the prior year quarter. Choline volumes sold, which track closely with broiler chick placements and egg sets, were higher in North America in the fourth quarter due to an increase in numbers of birds and their average weight. The current USDA forecast forbroiler meat production has improved slightly over the previous estimate for 2013; however, such improvement is dependent on more normal crop and grain growing conditions resulting in steady or declining feed prices for broilers.
 
The ANH specialty ingredients sector, largely targeted to the ruminant animal markets, realized approximately 3.4% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter. However, the comparative results in this sector were actually much stronger than the 3.4% suggests, as our results were adversely impacted by the previously announced suspension of sales of AminoShure-L, 52% lysine, which were realized in Q4 2011. Sales of non-Aminoshure products were up 15.2% in the quarter, led by strong volume growth of Reashure and Nitroshure, which caused us to move into an allocation mode for these products. Dairy economics continue to support strong demand for our products despite the challenges of production animal feed/ration prices. Milk prices are currently forecasted to remain strong, and expectations of moderating feed prices have resulted in a slightly higher 2013 forecast for dairy cow numbers. These indicators should support greater utilization of our products as nutritionists and herd managers look to continue to maximize results of production animals. Also, as mentioned in a previous press release, a new manufacturing facility in Virginia has been constructed to support current and expected growth. This new facility more than doubles output capacity for our rumen-stable products, and we commenced production at this site in January 2013.
Sales of industrial grade products realized significant growth from the prior year comparable quarter, particularly due to volume, comprising approximately 32% of the sales in this segment for the quarter, up from 23% in the prior year comparable quarter. This improvement came from sales of various choline and choline derivatives for industrial applications, notably from natural gas fracking, as well as intermediate sales of our Italian-produced methylamines.
Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased approximately 19% to a new quarterly record of $7.2 million as compared to $6.0 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This quarterly earnings result particularly reflects favorable operating efficiencies due to an overall 23% volume improvement in sales. These earnings were, however, unfavorably impacted by price increases in petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline and

start-up costs relating to the aforementioned new manufacturing facility in Virginia. Key raw materials rose at a very swift pace in the quarter, and while some increases were passed on to customers, our pricing initiatives in the quarter were not enough to offset all of the cost increasesAdditional price increases have been, and will be, implemented in the first quarter, where we are contractually able to do so, as our businesses are likely to remain affected by these higher costs for the balance of 2013.
.
 
The ARC Specialty Products (ARC) segment generated record quarterly sales of $13.0 million, an increase of 5.1% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of strong sales of ethylene oxide for medical device sterilization and propylene oxide for nutmeat fumigation, where volumes improved 30% sequentially from Q3 in coordination with the delay in almond harvest reported in Q3. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $5.5 million, improved 9.3% from the prior year comparable quarter due to efficiencies from increased volumes and a favorable product mix, which were partially offset by price increases in key petro-chemical commodities. We continue to monitor raw material prices  and seek to adjust prices timely within contractual guidelines.
 
Sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition (FPN) segment were $10.7 million, an increase of 11.0% from the comparable prior year quarter. The domestic and international food sector sales were up approximately 8% this quarter, as we saw growth of encapsulated ingredients for baking, prepared food, preservation and confection markets, especially in the European markets. We also realized strong double-digit growth in sales of our VitaShure products for nutritional enhancement, including sustained release amino acid products for sports performance products. Earnings from operations for this segment, however, declined to $2.3 million, versus $2.6 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to an unfavorable product mix and increases in costs of certain key raw materials for our human choline products.
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 improved 7.5% to $22.4 million, as compared to $20.8 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage did however decline to 28.0% of sales as compared to 29.9% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to the previously mentioned raw material cost increases, product mix and start-up costs relating to the new Virginia manufacturing facility. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $7.4 million were up approximately 3.0% from the prior year comparable quarter, however, declined as a percentage of sales to 9.2% from 10.3%, as we continue to prudently exercise tight controls over these expenses. Our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 was 34.5% and 31.0%, respectively. This increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a change in apportionment relating to state income taxes and the expiration/lack of renewal of the 2012 U.S. R&D tax credit.
The Company continues to maintain and grow a solid financial structure. Diligent working capital controls, particularly effective inventory and accounts receivable management, contribute strongly to the business performance. The $181.7 million of net working capital on December 31, 2012 included a cash balance of $144.7 million, up from $114.8 million at December 31, 2011, and reflects the early pay-down of the Italian long-term debt, the early $6.5 million payment in December of our 2012 dividend to shareholders and $13.9 million of capital expense funding, predominantly for the new Virginia site.

Commenting further, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, CEO and President of Balchem said, These record fourth quarter achievements are a reflection of strong underlying focus on generating sales growth in our core business segments, and the value of our diversified portfolio. As noted previously, certain quarterly fluctuations of any particular segment or product line will occur, like softness in our FPN domestic food encapsulates, human choline, and ANH Specialties, which were neatly offset by steady growth in ARC and double-digit growth in the ANH industrial grade products. Staying focused on macro-economic market trends and responsive to cautious near-term actions by our customers is critically important during these economically challenging times. Development efforts of pipeline products and prospects continue. We remain focused on operating expense management, new production (Virginia) and supply chain capabilities, including but not limited to logistics and currency, to deliver cost competitive solutions to our customers. Our balance sheet has continued to strengthen, as we continue to seek out strategic acquisitions or partnership ventures to complement the noted organic growth.

Exhibit 99.1
 
Balchem Corporation Announces First Quarter 2013 Results
Record Quarterly Sales & Net Earnings
For the quarter ended March 31, 2013, the company achieved record quarterly net sales of $84.7 million, which is an increase of approximately 11% above the $76.2 million result of the prior year comparative quarter. Record quarterly net earnings were achieved of $10.9 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 17.5% as compared with the same period last year. The $10.9 million generated diluted net earnings of $0.36 per common share versus $0.31 per common share for the prior year comparable period, an increase of 16.1%.
In this first quarter of 2013, the Animal Nutrition & Health (ANH) segment, including specialties, choline and industrial derivative products, realized record sales of $60.9 million, an increase of 14.4%, or $7.7 million over the prior year comparable quarter. Our global feed grade choline product sales were up 8.4%, particularly from our North American customer base, over the prior year quarter. Choline volumes sold, which track closely with broiler chick placements and egg sets, were slightly higher in North America in the first quarter due to an increase in numbers of birds and their average weight. The current USDA forecast forbroiler meat production continues to forecast modest growth for 2013; however, such improvement is dependent on more normal crop and grain growing conditions resulting in steady or declining feed prices for broilers.
 
 
 
 
 
 
The ANH specialty ingredients sector, largely targeted to the ruminant animal markets, realized approximately 8.7% sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter. However, the comparative results in this sector were considerably stronger than the 8.7% suggests, as our results were adversely impacted by the previously announced suspension of sales of AminoShure-L, 52% lysine, which were realized in Q1 2012. Sequentially, sales of non-AminoShure products were up 19.7% in the quarter, led by strong volume growth of ReaShure and NitroShure. Dairy economics continue to support strong demand for our products despite the challenges of production animal feed/ration prices. The U.S. dairy industry is poised to capitalize on rising export demand due to tighter than expected worldwide milk supplies. Milk prices are currently forecasted to remain strong, and expectations of moderating feed prices along with strong export opportunities are all positive indicators that should support greater utilization of our products as nutritionists and herd managers look to continue to maximize results of production animals. Our new manufacturing facility in Virginia is on-line and supporting our growth in this market.
Sales of industrial grade products realized significant growth from the prior year comparable quarter, particularly due to volume, comprising approximately 32% of the sales in this segment for the quarter, up from 29% in the prior year comparable quarter. This improvement came principally from sales of various choline and choline derivatives for industrial applications, notably from natural gas fracking.
Earnings from operations for the entire ANH segment increased approximately 36% to a new quarterly record of $8.4 million as compared to $6.2 million in the prior year comparable quarter. This quarterly earnings result particularly reflects favorable operating efficiencies due to an overall 13% volume improvement in sales and lower costs of certain petro-chemical commodities used to manufacture choline and derivatives. We continue to monitor raw material prices, which did rise on a sequential basis, and seek to adjust prices within contractual guidelines.
The ARC Specialty Products (ARC) segment generated record Q1 sales of $12.8 million, an increase of 4.3% from the comparable prior year quarter. This increase was principally the result of strong sales of propylene oxide for synthesis and nutmeat fumigation and solid sales of Ethylene Oxide for medical device sterilization. Earnings from operations for this segment, at $4.9 million, improved 3.8% from the prior year comparable quarter due to efficiencies from increased volumes.
 
Sales of the Food, Pharma & Nutrition (FPN) segment were $11.0 million, an increase of 2.5% from the comparable prior year quarter. The domestic food sector sales were up approximately 10.5% this quarter, as we saw growth of encapsulated ingredients for baking and prepared food markets. We also realized strong double-digit growth in sales of our VitaShure products for nutritional enhancement, including sustained release amino acid products for sports performance products. We did realize a modest decline in our human choline sector, from the prior year quarter, but this was still an 8% sequential quarterly increase. Earnings from operations for this segment, however, declined 7.5% to $2.5 million, versus $2.7 million in the prior year comparable quarter, largely due to increases in costs of certain key raw materials for our human choline products.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Consolidated gross margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 improved 14.5% to $24.2 million, as compared to $21.2 million for the prior year comparable period. Gross margin percentage improved to 28.6% of sales as compared to 27.8% in the prior year comparative period, principally due to an overall 12% volume increase. Operating (Selling, R&D, and General and Administrative) expenses at $8.4 million were up approximately 11.8% from the prior year comparable quarter principally due to an increase of employee headcount and higher consulting and professional fees.  Our effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 was 31.4% and 32.3%, respectively. This decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the timing of certain tax credits.
The Company continues to maintain and grow a solid financial structure. Diligent working capital controls contribute strongly to the business performance. The $195.6 million of net working capital on March 31, 2013 included a cash balance of $149 million, up from $145 million at December 31, 2012, and reflects $3.4 million of capital expense funding, predominantly for the new Virginia site.
Commenting further, Dino A. Rossi, Chairman, CEO and President of Balchem said, These double-digit growth achievements are a reflection of strong underlying focus on generating sales growth from our core business segments. Our diversified portfolio, as noted previously, will generate certain quarterly fluctuations in any particular segment. Softness in our FPN human choline, and the noted negative effect of the decline of AminoShure products in the ANH Specialties, were offset by steady growth in ARC, double-digit growth in the other ANH Specialties, and industrial grade products. Staying focused on mega market trends and near-term actions by our customers is critically important during these economically challenging times. Targeted development efforts of new products and global prospects continue, as reflected in increased operating expenses. The new production facility in Virginia has improved our supply chain capabilities, allowing us to deliver cost competitive solutions to our customers. Our balance sheet has continued to strengthen and we continue to seek out strategic acquisitions or partnership ventures to complement the noted organic growth.
