Exhibit Index Exhibit No. Description 99.1 Press Release, dated as of April 17, 2003, entitled "Atmel Announces First Quarter 2003 Financial Results" 4

Exhibit 99.1 Atmel Announces First Quarter 2003 Financial Results SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 17, 2003--Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003. Revenues for the first quarter of 2003 totaled $296,478,000, versus $304,631,000 in the fourth quarter of 2002 and $275,773,000 in the first quarter of 2002. This represents a sequential decline in revenues of 3% and year over year growth of 8%. Net loss for the first quarter of 2003 totaled $53,120,000 or $0.11 per share. The net loss for the first quarter included an expense of $10 million, or $0.02 per share, related to a patent licensing agreement with IBM. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company reported a net loss of $16,207,000 or $0.03 per share. The net loss for the fourth quarter 2002 included a positive $0.03 per share related to a gain on early retirement of debt offset by restructuring charges. In the first quarter of 2002, the Company's net loss was $44,333,000 or $0.09 per share. Cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as of March 31, 2003 were approximately $434 million, representing a decrease of $12.1 million from December 31,2002. During the same period, total debt was reduced by $25.8 million. The Company also has $23.5 million in restricted cash. Additionally, accounts receivable and inventory decreased by $7.3 million and $8.8 million respectively during the quarter. "First quarter revenues were slightly lower than expected, primarily due to pricing pressure in the serial EEPROM market," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "However, we were very pleased with the performance of our ASIC business, specifically smart cards, which experienced healthy growth and received significant design wins, including the silicon platform for the next generation of chip-based bank cards." Perlegos added, "During the quarter, we shipped a record number of our proprietary AVR microcontrollers and began seeing signs that this market is improving, as indicated by our current and potential customers' purchases of in-circuit emulators and starter kits. "Additionally, we remain focused on adding to our significant intellectual property and expertise to help customers offer smaller, portable, wireless, secure, cost-effective and complete system solutions. During the quarter, we introduced a single-chip dual Ethernet 802.11b wireless LAN with advanced security features, established compliance with the Trusted Computing Group, a newly formed organization driving the standards of security, and introduced the ARM-9 microcontroller architecture geared toward enhanced performance applications in our ASIC group," concluded Perlegos. Outlook The Company believes that in the second quarter of 2003, revenues should grow 2-4% sequentially, reaching about $302-308 million. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $60-63 million, while SG&A should remain between $30-33 million. Finally, gross margins should remain approximately 22% in the second quarter.

Exhibit 99.1 Atmel Announces Growth in all Four Business Units During Second Quarter 2003; 7% Sequential Revenue Growth for Q2 SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 17, 2003--Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq:ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003. Revenues for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $318,472,000, versus $296,478,000 in the first quarter of 2003 and $314,753,000 in the second quarter of 2002. This represents a sequential increase in revenues of 7% and year over year growth of 1%. Net loss for the second quarter of 2003 totaled $44,077,000 or $0.09 per share. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company reported a net loss of $53,120,000 or $0.11 per share. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company's net loss was $478,931,000 or $1.02 per share. Included in the net loss for the second quarter of 2002 were approximately $341 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges. The net impact of currency changes during the second quarter of 2003 was approximately $5 million, lowering results by one penny per share. After adding back the $70 million non-cash expense of depreciation and amortization to the net loss of $44 million for the second quarter 2003, the Company generated $26 million to use towards the reduction of debt. During the quarter, the Company paid off approximately $135 million related to the 2018 convertible bond. Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash as of June 30, 2003 were approximately $313 million. "We are very excited to report that we saw an increase in demand in the majority of our product lines during the second quarter," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Revenue grew in each of our four business units, led by continued market share gains in smart cards and record unit shipments of our proprietary AVR microcontrollers." Perlegos added, "During the quarter, we continued the migration to higher density non-volatile memory products, introducing our 128Mb DataFlash, the world's fastest serial interface flash memory. "Additionally, we jointly introduced with Wavecom SA a single chip GPS/GPRS baseband processor that will serve 2.5G phones as well as future generations of phones. Through this partnership, we anticipate the introduction of many wireless application components over the coming quarters. "The Company also introduced a new secure memory solution that utilizes the strengths of our smart card products. This new family of lower-cost products is focused on access control and secure data applications such as PDAs and networking systems. Additionally, this product family provides the industry with the only secure memory with data encryption, demonstrating Atmel's growing presence in the security industry," concluded Perlegos. Outlook The Company believes that in the third quarter of 2003, revenues should be sequentially flat to up slightly, as much of the European business is seasonally slow. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $63-65 million, while SG&A should remain between $34-36 million. Finally, gross margins should be sequentially flat in the third quarter.

In the second quarter of 2003, the Company reported a net loss of $44,077,000 or $0.09 per share. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company's net loss was $102,325,000 or $0.22 per share. Included in the net loss for the third quarter of 2002 was approximately $39,630,000 of restructuring and asset impairment charges. After adding back the $68 million non-cash expense of depreciation and amortization to the net loss of $32 million for the third quarter 2003, the Company generated $36 million to use towards the reduction of debt. Over the last twelve months, Atmel has reduced its overall debt by over $245 million, while cash has only decreased by approximately $90 million. Cash as of September 30, 2003 was approximately $408 million. Cash, in this context, refers to cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. "Demand for our products has increased significantly over the last two quarters," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "As we are seeing this trend continue into the next couple of quarters, it provides us with a clear indication that the upturn for the next semiconductor cycle has arrived." Perlegos added, "During the quarter, smart card ICs continued to be a key contributor to the Company's growth, as have system level ARM based ASICs and serial EEPROMs. "Additionally, we introduced a number of new products during the quarter. Included in these new products is our fourth generation controller that goes into a Disk on Key solution for a key customer. We also introduced our high performance, low cost digital camera processor that can process images with up to 6 megapixels. This product optimizes speed and power consumption for the fast growing consumer digital camera market," concluded Perlegos. Outlook The Company anticipates that in the fourth quarter of 2003, revenues should be sequentially up 3-6%, raising its guidance from last quarter. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $57-61 million, while SG&A should remain between $33-36 million. Finally, gross margins should be up about one percentage point in the fourth quarter.

Exhibit 99.1 Atmel Delivers Second Consecutive Profitable Quarter 37% Year Over Year and 7% Sequential Revenue Growth for the First Quarter SAN JOSE, Calif., April 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004. Revenues for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $407,395,000, versus $380,498,000 in the fourth quarter of 2003 and $296,478,000 in the first quarter of 2003. Net income for the first quarter of 2004 totaled $11,009,000 or $0.02 per share, which compares to net income of $10,996,000 or $0.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2003, and a net loss of $53,120,000 or $0.11 per share for the first quarter of 2003. Included in the results for the fourth quarter of 2003 is $37,850,000 of other income received as a result of a legal award, partially offset by $27,632,000 in asset impairment charges. The net loss for the first quarter of 2003 included a patent licensing expense in cost of sales of $10,000,000. During the quarter, the Company generated $85 million to use towards the continued reduction of debt and to fund ongoing business events. This figure is calculated by adding back the $74 million non-cash expense of depreciation and amortization to the net income for the first quarter of approximately $11 million. During the last twelve months, Atmel has reduced its overall debt by nearly $246 million, while cash has increased by over $15 million. Cash as of March 31, 2004 was approximately $472 million. Cash, in this context, refers to cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. "Once again, we realized healthy revenue and earnings growth," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Microcontroller business led the way with nearly 50% year over year revenue growth, as we continue to outpace the competition in the 8-bit MCU market. Better earnings are driven by improvements in our overall gross margin, which exceeded 29% for the quarter. This margin increase is due to better utilization of our assets, sales of a richer product mix and an improving business environment." "During the first quarter, sales from the ASIC business unit grew 42% year over year and 5% sequentially, representing nine consecutive quarters in which this segment has grown. We won several design wins for our smart card ICs during the quarter, specifically for SIM cards, which go into GSM phones, and for health cards. "We also experienced strong year over year and sequential sales growth of 47% and 15%, respectively, in our microcontroller business unit. During the quarter, our proprietary AVR product shipped its 500 millionth unit since its introduction in 1997. This product remains the industry's fastest and most flexible solution for the 8-bit microcontroller market. During 2003, customers purchased more development tools from Atmel than from any of our competitors. The purchase of these development tools is a key leading indicator for future business. "Sales in our RF and Automotive business unit were up 32% year over year and 8% sequentially. Demand for automotive products continues to increase, as cars are using more and more silicon. We also received a major design win with a top tier cellular phone maker. "During the first quarter, strong demand has boosted sales of memory products, resulting in a 28% year over year and a 3% sequential increase. Both flash and Serial EEPROM benefited from an improved business environment," concluded Mr. Perlegos. Margins have improved in the flash business due to increased production of our higher densities on 0.18-micron technology. Outlook The Company anticipates that in the second quarter of 2004, revenues should be sequentially up 4-6%. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $58-60 million, while SG&A should be between $44-46 million. Finally, gross margins should be flat to up 1 point during the second quarter. Net interest expense should be approximately $5.5 million for the second quarter, while tax expense should be about $5 million. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $75-76 million.

Exhibit 99.1
        SAN JOSE, Calif., July 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/  Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004.
        Revenues for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $420,803,000, versus $407,395,000 in the first quarter of 2004 and $318,472,000 in the second quarter of 2003. Net income for the second quarter of 2004 totaled $11,651,000 or $0.02 per share, which compares to net income of $11,009,000 or $0.02 per share for the first quarter of 2004, and a net loss of $44,077,000 or $0.09 per share for the second quarter of 2003.
        During the quarter, the Company generated $85 million to use towards the continued reduction of debt and to fund ongoing business events. This figure is calculated by adding back the $73 million non-cash expense of depreciation and amortization to the net income for the second quarter of approximately $12 million. Cash as of June 30, 2004 was approximately $411 million. Cash, in this context, refers to cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.
        "This represents a second consecutive quarter in which revenue grew by more than 30% on a year over year basis," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "With six months of 2004 behind us, we are confident that we will be able to achieve the 27-32% revenue growth that we forecasted for the 2004 fiscal year.
        "During the quarter, sales from the ASIC business unit grew 32% year over year and declined 2% sequentially. We had multiple design wins for both our smart card ICs and our smart card reader ICs during the quarter. Additionally, we introduced a microcontroller with a ZigBee radio to produce the first turnkey solution for the low data rate, low frequency wireless ZigBee standard.
        "We also experienced year over year and sequential sales growth of 40% and 9%, respectively, in our microcontroller business unit. During the quarter, our proprietary AVR product received the Frost & Sullivan award for innovation and product differentiation. Frost & Sullivan also acknowledged Atmel's number one market share position in the 8-bit flash based microcontroller market.
        "Sales in our RF and Automotive business unit were up 7% year over year and down 7% sequentially. During the third quarter, we expect a return to growth as we have begun ramping production of our 8" Silicon Germanium technology, driven by demand for CDMA phones. This demand should provide material revenue growth in the second half of the year, as well as throughout 2005.
        "During the second quarter, our strongest sales were of memory products, resulting in a 43% year over year and a 12% sequential increase. Growth was led by flash and Serial EEPROM, and more specifically, by consumer and PC products," concluded Mr. Perlegos.
        Outlook
        The Company anticipates that in the third quarter of 2004, revenues should be sequentially up 2-6%. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $59-61 million, while SG&A should be between $44-46 million. Finally, gross margins should be slightly up during the third quarter. Net interest expense should be between $4 and 4.5 million for the third quarter, while tax expense should be about $5 million. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $74-75 million.

Exhibit 99.1
        SAN JOSE, Calif., Sept. 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced revised expectations for the third quarter ending September 30, 2004.
        Revenues for the third quarter of 2004 are expected to be 2-6% lower than the second quarter 2004 revenue. The Company anticipates gross margins of between 25-26% for the quarter. Guidance ranges for R&D and SG&A remain unchanged from $59-61 million and $44-46 million, respectively. Finally, net interest expense is expected to be between $4 and $4.5 million for the third quarter, while we anticipate tax expense being around $5 million for the third quarter.
        "The revision in revenue guidance reflects softer than anticipated summer sales, which led to lower than expected market prices for some of our products," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. Our microcontroller and memory businesses were the most impacted."
        "Atmel is scheduled to report its 2004 third quarter financial results on October 26, 2004 after the close of the stock market.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99.1 Press release, dated as of October 26, 2004, entitled "Atmel Reports Third Quarter Earnings Results"

Exhibit 99.1 Atmel Reports Third Quarter Earnings Results 23% Year Over Year Revenue Growth for the Third Quarter SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004. Revenues for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $413,237,000, versus $420,803,000 in the second quarter of 2004 and $335,187,000 in the third quarter of 2003. Operating income for the third quarter of 2004 was $4,901,000. Net loss for the third quarter of 2004 totaled $28,147,000 or $0.06 per share. This is compared to a net income of $11,651,000 or $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2004, and a net loss of $31,791,000 or $0.07 per share for the third quarter of 2003. The net loss for the third quarter of 2004 includes $28,005,000 of tax expense for certain profitable foreign subsidiaries. The Company uses the "effective tax rate" methodology, which has resulted in a large amount of the total year tax expense to be recognized in the third quarter as the Company's first half of 2004 profits exceed the profits now anticipated from the second half of the year. "During the quarter, we were able to grow the business over 20% on a year over year basis, however, our revenue was down 2% on a sequential basis. Our ASIC and RF businesses continue to grow due to our proprietary products. Our memory business was approximately flat because of pricing pressure, while lower demand in military and aerospace caused our Microcontroller business to decline this quarter," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "During the quarter, sales from the ASIC business unit grew 22% year over year and 7% sequentially, led by our proprietary ASIC products. Also doing well in our ASIC group are our smart card ICs, which continue to receive strong design wins based on an architecture that is faster and more flexible than our competitors. "We also experienced year over year sales growth of 11% in our Microcontroller business unit, while we had a sequential sales decline of 22%. Although we experienced a weakening of demand in our military and aerospace products, sales of our proprietary AVR products were up slightly. "Sales in our RF and Automotive business unit were up 32% year over year and 18% sequentially. We accomplished this by ramping the production of our 8" Silicon Germanium technology, and we continue to supply BiCMOS RF products for CDMA phones. "During the third quarter, our memory products experienced 29% year over year sales growth with a 6% sequential decrease. This sequential decline is mainly due to lower Serial EEPROM sales and pricing pressure for our Flash products," concluded Mr. Perlegos. "As we begin the fourth quarter, we see strength in our ASIC, RF and Microcontroller businesses as demand for our proprietary products increases. However, we anticipate that memory revenue will be down in the quarter as we continue to see pricing pressure. Outlook The Company anticipates that in the fourth quarter of 2004, revenues should be about flat. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $65-68 million, while SG&A should be between $44-47 million. Gross margins should be flat to down a point during the fourth quarter. Net interest expense should be around $5.5 million for the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, the Company expects to realize a tax benefit of about $8 million, which is also a result of using the "effective tax rate" method. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $72-73 million. Teleconference Atmel will hold a teleconference for the financial community at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time today to discuss third quarter financial results. Atmel will provide a real-time audio broadcast of the teleconference from the Investor Relations page of its website at http://www.atmel.com .

Exhibit 99.1 ATMEL REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2004 AND THE FOURTH QUARTER ANNUAL REVENUE GROWS 24% AND GROSS MARGIN IMPROVES BY OVER 5 POINTS IN 2004 SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled $408,287,000, versus $413,237,000 in the third quarter of 2004 and $380,498,000 in the fourth quarter of 2003. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2004 was $2,876,000. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2004 totaled $7,085,000 or $0.01 per share. These results compare to a net loss of $18,009,000 or $0.04 per share for the third quarter of 2004, as well as a net income of $10,996,000 or $0.02 per share for the fourth quarter of 2003. Revenues for the full year 2004 totaled $1,649,722,000, versus $1,330,635,000 in 2003. Operating income for the full year was $47,007,000. Net loss for the full year 2004 improved to $2,434,000 or $0.01 per share, compared to a net loss of $117,996,000 or $0.25 per share in 2003. "In 2004, we grew revenue by 24% and improved our gross margins 5 and a half points by achieving manufacturing efficiencies and by selling a richer product mix," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We were particularly pleased that the revenue growth for the year came from all of our business units. We believe that our approach of utilizing our expertise in microcontrollers, memory and RF to provide our customers with complete system solutions has positioned us well for the years to come. "While the ASIC revenue was down 2% sequentially in the fourth quarter, growth for the entire year was 23%. Smart card ICs continued to lead the way in having both a record revenue quarter and year, while maintaining strong design win activity. "During the fourth quarter, our microcontroller sales declined about 3% from Q3, while the growth for 2004 was approximately 24%. Our proprietary AVR product outpaced the market during 2004 by growing by more than 40%, over twice the pace of the 8-bit microcontroller industry. "Sales in our RF and Automotive business unit in the fourth quarter were up 5% sequentially and 24% year over year. The main reason for the growth during the quarter was continued increases in our production of RF BiCMOS products for CDMA phones. "During the fourth quarter, our Non Volatile Memory business declined 3% sequentially, while it grew 25% in 2004. Our serial EEPROM products were impacted during the second half of the year by inventory in Asia, although we believe that we are now returning to more normal levels. Additionally, our flash products continued to experience pricing pressure, while our DataFlash product continued to gain traction in the PC peripheral space," concluded Mr. Perlegos.
Outlook The Company anticipates that for the first quarter of 2005, revenues should be about flat, slightly better than normal seasonal patterns. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $69-71 million, while SG&A should be between $48-50 million. Finally, gross margins should be down one to two points during the first quarter, primarily due to the weakening dollar. Net interest expense for the quarter should be approximately $5.5 million for the first quarter, while income taxes should be approximately $5 million. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $78-79 million. For the full year of 2005, the Company anticipates being able to grow revenue in the 5-9 percentage range. Gross margins should improve during the year, beginning in the second quarter.

Exhibit 99.1 ATMEL UPDATES FIRST QUARTER EXPECTATIONS SAN JOSE, Calif., April 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced revised expectations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005. Revenues for the first quarter of 2005 are expected to be up 2-3% when compared to fourth quarter 2004 revenue, just above expectations. However, the Company anticipates gross margins of between 21-23% for the quarter, below expectations, and estimates that R&D and SG&A expenses should be about $74-75 million and $52-53 million, respectively. Net interest expense is expected to be between $3 and $4 million for the first quarter, and we anticipate tax expense being between $4 and $6 million for the first quarter. These components should yield a loss per share of between 8 and 10 cents. "Although sales were better than what we expected, average selling prices for some of our products, mainly smart card ICs and flash products, were lower than anticipated," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our results were also impacted by inventory adjustments related to the lower average selling prices. Additionally, we experienced manufacturing issues in the production of our smart card ICs." These ranges of our expected results are based on management's initial analysis of operating results. Atmel is scheduled to report its 2005 first quarter financial results on April 26, 2005 after the close of the stock market. Teleconference Atmel will hold a brief teleconference for the financial community at 6:00 AM Pacific Time today to discuss the revised first quarter financial expectations. Atmel will provide a real-time audio broadcast of the teleconference from the Investor Relations page of its website at http://www.atmel.com .

Exhibit 99.1 ATMEL REPORTS REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 SAN JOSE, Calif., April 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005. Revenues for the first quarter of 2005 totaled $419.8 million, versus $408.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and $407.4 million in the first quarter of 2004. Net loss for the first quarter of 2005 totaled $43.0 million or $0.09 per share. These results compare to a net loss of $7.1 million or $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2004, as well as a net income of $11.0 million or $0.02 per share for the first quarter of 2004. "Demand for our products strengthened during the first quarter, as illustrated by the 3% sequential revenue growth, despite a tough pricing environment," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "As we experienced some manufacturing difficulties during the quarter, our gross margins came under pressure. We are now taking steps to improve our overall cost structure in such a way that allows our increasing demand to more fully yield increased profits. "Our ASIC revenue grew 3% sequentially in the first quarter, and was up 4% over the first quarter of 2004. Smart card ICs were the main contributor to the revenue growth. As this business continues to provide revenue growth and market share gains, we are working diligently to improve the yields of our smart card IC wafers as well as to increase the production of our smart card ICs on a 0.18-micron line width in order to improve their profitability. Up to this point of the second quarter of 2005, we have already seen material improvements in both the yields and the ramp of our 0.18-micron smart card wafers. "During the first quarter of 2005, our microcontroller sales grew approximately 2% sequentially, while they declined by approximately 20% year over year. We experienced growth in our proprietary AVR and 8051 microcontroller products. The decline in revenue from the first quarter of 2004 is primarily related to the end of life buys for some of our military and aerospace products during the first quarter of 2004. "Sales in our RF and Automotive business unit in the first quarter were up 21% sequentially and 40% year over year. An increase in our production of RF BiCMOS products for CDMA phones was the main reason for the growth during the quarter. "During the first quarter, our Non Volatile Memory business declined 10% sequentially and declined 8% when compared to the first quarter of 2004. Recently, we have chosen to significantly shift our approach to selling memory by focusing on our serial memory products, which include serial EEPROM and serial DataFlash(TM) products. Our serial products have experienced 6% sequential and 6% year over year growth, and have maintained the number one market share position in their respective markets," concluded Mr. Perlegos.
Outlook The Company anticipates that for the second quarter of 2005, revenues should be flat to slightly up when compared to the first quarter of 2005. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $70-$74 million, while SG&A should be between $48-$52 million. Finally, gross margins should be up two to three points during the second quarter, primarily due to manufacturing improvements in our smart card ICs. Net interest expense for the quarter should be approximately $4-$6 million, while income taxes should be approximately $2-$6 million. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $77-$80 million. Teleconference Atmel will hold a teleconference for the financial community at 3:00 p.m. Pacific Time today to discuss the first quarter financial results.

Multiple Administrative Bodies
                    (ii) . To the extent that the Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify Awards granted hereunder as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. For purposes of qualifying grants of Awards as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Committee on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Awards to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Awards that are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Awards under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).
Section 162(m)
                    (iii) . To the extent desirable to qualify transactions hereunder as exempt under Rule 16b-3, the transactions contemplated hereunder shall be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption under Rule 16b-3.

Powers of the Administrator

                    (ii) to select the Service Providers to whom Awards may be granted hereunder;
                    (iii) to determine the number of shares of Common Stock to be covered by each Award granted hereunder;
                    (iv) to approve forms of agreement for use under the Plan;
                    (v) to determine the terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan, of any Award granted hereunder. Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Awards may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;
                    (vi) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards granted pursuant to the Plan;
                    (vii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws;

The Fair Market Value of the Shares to be withheld shall be determined on the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. All elections by an Optionee to have Shares withheld for this purpose shall be made in such form and under such conditions as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable;
                    (x) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of an Award previously granted by the Administrator;

Additional Power of Administrator Requiring Stockholder Approval
                    (i) reduce the exercise price of any Award to the then current Fair Market Value if the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock covered by such Award shall have declined since the date the Award was granted; provided, however, that the Administrator shall have the
 
power to make adjustments in the exercise price of any Award pursuant to Section 16 without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval;
                    (ii) institute an Option Exchange Program to allow for the cancellation of an outstanding Option followed by its immediate replacement with a new Option with a lower exercise price, or with a different type of Award, cash or a combination thereof; provided, however, that the Administrator shall have the power to make adjustments in the exercise price of any Award pursuant to Section 16 without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval; and
                    (iii) institute any other program that would constitute a revaluation or repricing of Options; provided, however, that the Administrator shall have the power to make adjustments in the exercise price of any Award pursuant to Section 16 without the necessity of obtaining stockholder approval.
          (d) . The Administrator's decisions, determinations and interpretations shall be final and binding on all Optionees and any other holders of Options or Stock Purchase Rights.
Effect of Administrator's Decision
     6. . Nonstatutory Stock Options, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Units may be granted to Service Providers. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees.
Eligibility
     7. .
Limitations
          (a) Each Option shall be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 7(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
          (b) Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
          (c) The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Units:
                    (i) No Service Provider shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company, Options, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units to purchase more than 1,500,000 Shares.
                    (ii) In connection with his or her initial service, a Service Provider may be granted Options, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units to
 
purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 Shares which shall not count against the limit set forth in subsection (i) above.
                    (iii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 16.
                    (iv) If an Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Unit is cancelled in the same fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 16), the cancelled Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Unit is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units and the grant of a new Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units.
     8. . Subject to Section 22 of the Plan, the Plan shall become effective upon adoption by the Board and obtaining stockholder approval. The Plan amends and restates the previous 1996 Stock Plan.

          (a) . The per share exercise price for the Shares to be issued pursuant to exercise of an Option shall be determined by the Administrator, subject to the following:
Exercise Price
                    (i) In the case of an Incentive Stock Option
                              (A) granted to an Employee who, at the time the Incentive Stock Option is granted, owns stock representing more than ten percent (10%) of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
                              (B) granted to any Employee other than an Employee described in paragraph (A) immediately above, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
                    (ii) In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option, the per Share exercise price shall be determined by the Administrator. In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option intended
 
to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant.
                    (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Options may be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant pursuant to a merger or other corporate transaction.
          (b) . At the time an Option is granted, the Administrator shall fix the period within which the Option may be exercised and shall determine any conditions which must be satisfied before the Option may be exercised.
Waiting Period and Exercise Dates
          (c) . The Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment.

                    (ii) check;
                    (iii) other Shares, which in the case of Shares acquired directly or indirectly from the Company, (A) have been vested and owned by the Optionee for more than six months on the date of surrender, and (B) have a Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised;
                    (iv) consideration received by the Company under a cashless exercise program implemented by the Company in connection with the Plan;
                    (v) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the Optionee, including any liability attributable to the Optionee's participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement;
                    (vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment; or
                    (vii) such other consideration and method of payment for the issuance of Shares to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

Exercise of Option

Except for options granted prior to October 11, 1996, or unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Options granted hereunder shall be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder
 
                    An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 16 of the Plan.
                    Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
          (b) . If an Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Optionee's death or Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Optionee's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
          (c) . If an Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Optionee's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
Disability of Optionee
          (d) . If an Optionee dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Optionee's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Optionee's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Optionee's death in a form acceptable to the Administrator. If no such beneficiary has been designated by the Optionee,
Death of Optionee
 
then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Optionee's estate or by the person(s) to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Optionee's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Optionee's death. If, at the time of death, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
     12. .
Stock Purchase Rights
          (a) . Stock Purchase Rights may be issued either alone, in addition to, or in tandem with other awards granted under the Plan and/or cash awards made outside of the Plan. After the Administrator determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall advise the offeree in writing or electronically, by means of a Notice of Grant, of the terms, conditions and restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the offeree shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the time within which the offeree must accept such offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement in the form determined by the Administrator.
Rights to Purchase
          (b) . The Administrator shall have complete discretion to determine the number of Stock Purchase Rights granted to any Participant, provided that during any Fiscal Year, no Participant shall be granted Stock Purchase Rights covering more than 1,500,000 Shares, unless in connection with his or her initial service as described in Section 7(c)(ii).
Number of Shares
          (c) . Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with the Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The purchase price for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall be the original price paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate determined by the Administrator.
Repurchase Option
          (d) . The Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall contain such other terms, provisions and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion.
Other Provisions
          (e) . Once the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as provided in Section 16 of the Plan.

The Administrator will set Performance Goals or other vesting provisions (including, without limitation, continued status as a Service Provider) in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Restricted Stock Units that will be paid out to the Service Providers. The time period during which the Performance Goals or other vesting provisions must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each award of Restricted Stock Units will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator may set Performance Goals based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
Performance Goals and Other Terms
          (e) . The Administrator will set the length of time for a Performance Period, subject to the following limits:
Duration of Performance Periods
                    (i) The Performance Period related to Restricted Stock Units with Performance Goals shall not be less than one (1) year; and
                    (ii) The Performance Period related to Restricted Stock Units with time-based vesting provisions shall not be less than three (3) years;
     provided, however, that up to five percent (5%) of the shares currently authorized for grant under the Plan may be subject to Restricted Stock Units without such limits on the length of the Performance Period.
          (f) . After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Restricted Stock Units will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Restricted Stock Units earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding Performance Goals or other vesting provisions have been achieved. After the grant of a Restricted Stock Units, the Administrator shall not reduce or waive any Performance Goals or other vesting provisions for such Restricted Stock Unit; provided, however, that the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any
Earning of Restricted Stock Units
 
Performance Goals or other vesting provisions for such Restricted Stock Unit in the event of a Participant's death, Disability, or Retirement, or in the event of the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or a merger of the Company with or into another entity pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company before such transaction do not retain, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the beneficial interest in the voting stock of the Company after such transaction.
          (g) . Payment of earned Restricted Stock Units will be made as soon as practicable after the expiration of the applicable Performance Period. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Restricted Stock Units in the form of cash, in Shares (which have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the value of the earned Restricted Stock Units at the close of the applicable Performance Period) or in a combination thereof.
Form and Timing of Payment of Restricted Stock Units
          (h) . On the date set forth in the Award Agreement, all unearned or unvested Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited to the Company, and again will be available for grant under the Plan.
Cancellation of Restricted Stock Units
     15. . Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the Optionee, only by the Optionee. If the Administrator makes an Award transferable, such Award shall contain such additional terms and conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate.
Non-Transferability of Awards
     16. .
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization, Dissolution or Liquidation, Merger or Asset Sale
          (a) . Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number and class of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits in Sections 4, 7, 13 and 14 of the Plan, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Shares, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.
Changes in Capitalization
          (b) . In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any
Dissolution or Liquidation
 
Company repurchase option applicable to any Shares purchased upon exercise of an Award shall lapse as to all such Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
          (c) . In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, and, with respect to Restricted Stock Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of 15 days from the date of such notice, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
Merger or Asset Sale
                    For the purposes of this paragraph, the Award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Restricted Stock Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Restricted Stock Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Restricted Stock Units by the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets.
                    Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the successor corporation's corporate structure post-merger or post-sale of assets will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
 
     17. . The date of grant of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
     18. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
          (a) . The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
          (b) . The Company shall obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws, and to adopt material Plan amendments, including:
Shareholder Approval
                    (i) A material increase in benefits accrued to Participants under the Plan;
                    (ii) An increase in the number of shares that may be optioned or sold under the Plan;
                    (iii) A material modification (expansion or reduction) of the class of participants in the Plan; or
                    (iv) A provision permitting the Administrator to lapse or waive restrictions on Awards at its discretion.
          (c) . No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.

          (a) . Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.

Investment Representations
     20. . The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any
Inability to Obtain Authority
 
liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
     21. . The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares

"We were pleased to have gross margins rebound during the quarter, with the lower costs being primarily related to improvements in the manufacturing of our smart card ICs," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "While we are always looking to make our manufacturing more efficient, we are continuing to evaluate cost cutting measures and a move towards outsourcing in an attempt to better position the company for a return to profitability. "To lower costs, we continue to evaluate reductions in our workforce and we expect to increase the amount of manufacturing that is outsourced. By shifting our manufacturing strategy, we expect lower costs and lower capital expenditures, helped by selling or closing some of our older overseas facilities. We also expect to reduce our research and development costs by eliminating low potential projects and by reducing the number of process technologies in our fabs. "Our ASIC revenues grew about 2% sequentially in the second quarter. During the quarter, we were able to increase the percentage of our smart card ICs being produced on 0.18-micron line width to just over 50% and materially increase the yields being achieved. These improvements in our manufacturing were the main reason for the company's increase in gross margin during the quarter. "During the second quarter of 2005, our microcontroller sales were flat sequentially. However, booking levels for our proprietary AVR microcontroller continue to be strong, providing the basis for a better second half of the year. "Sales in our RF and Automotive business unit in the second quarter were down 5% sequentially. Although our RF BiCMOS business was down during the quarter, we see forecasted volume increasing in future quarters. In addition, we have several new designs for future phones with an existing CDMA customer. "During the second quarter, our Non Volatile Memory business declined sequentially as we focus on serial based products. However, within the segment, our serial EEPROM products grew 4% due to strength in the consumer and PC applications," concluded Mr. Perlegos. Outlook The Company anticipates that for the third quarter of 2005, revenues and gross margins should be slightly up when compared to the second quarter of 2005. Additionally, R&D should be approximately $69-$73 million, while SG&A should be between $47-$51 million. Net interest expense for the quarter should be approximately $5-$8 million, while income taxes should be approximately $3-$5 million. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $68-$72 million.

Exhibit 99.1 ATMEL REPORTS IMPROVED RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005 GROSS MARGIN IMPROVES BY OVER 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS SAN JOSE, Calif., Oct. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development, fabrication and sale of advanced semiconductors, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005. Revenues for the third quarter of 2005 totaled $418.6 million, versus $412.2 million in the second quarter of 2005 and $413.2 million in the third quarter of 2004. Net loss for the third quarter of 2005 totaled $1.1 million or $0.00 per share. The third quarter results include a restructuring charge of $2.8 million related to headcount reductions. Also included in the third quarter results is $12.0 million of tax benefit resulting from the settlement of a tax audit related to one of our foreign entities. These results compare to a net loss of $42.6 million or $0.09 per share for the second quarter of 2005, as well as a net loss of $18.0 million or $0.04 per share for the third quarter of 2004. "In the third quarter, we significantly lowered our manufacturing costs, leading to over 5 percentage points of gross margin improvement," stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We expect to continue steadily reducing manufacturing and research and development spending, which should lead to further improvements in our operating profits. "Our ASIC revenues grew about 7% sequentially in the third quarter. During the quarter, we increased the percentage of our smart card ICs produced on 0.18-micron line width to over 80%, which contributed to the improved operating results of the ASIC business. "During the third quarter of 2005, our Microcontroller operating segment sales were down 4% sequentially, due mainly to the seasonal impact of our European military and aerospace business. However, we again saw growth in our proprietary AVR microcontroller products, which also enjoyed strong design win activity. Additionally, we shipped our first AVR units into the US automotive sector during the quarter. "Sales in our RF and Automotive operating segment in the third quarter were down 5% sequentially. Although our RF BiCMOS business was down during the quarter, we expect to ramp up new designs for CDMA phones during the fourth quarter. "During the third quarter, our Non Volatile Memory business increased by 4% sequentially, mainly due to increased sales of our serial based products. Both our serial EEPROM and serial DataFlash(R) business enjoyed stronger demand late in the third quarter," concluded Mr. Perlegos. Outlook The Company anticipates that for the fourth quarter of 2005, revenues should increase about 1-3%, while gross margin should increase approximately 1 percentage point as compared to the third quarter of 2005. Additionally, R&D is expected to be approximately $67-$70 million, while SG&A is expected to be between $46-$50 million. Net interest expense for the quarter is expected to be approximately $6-$7 million, while income taxes are expected to be approximately $1-$3 million. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization will be approximately $67-$70 million.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SAN JOSE, Calif., January 31, 2006  Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a worldwide leader in the development and fabrication of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2005 totaled $425.2 million, a sequential increase of 1.6% compared to the $418.6 million reported in the third quarter of 2005, and a 4.1% increase compared to the $408.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2005 totaled $53.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share. These results compare to a net loss of $1.1 million or $0.00 per share for the third quarter of 2005, and a net loss of $7.1 million or $0.01 per share for the fourth quarter of 2004.
For the full year, Atmel reported 2005 revenues of $1.68 billion, a 1.6% increase compared to the $1.65 billion in 2004. Net loss for the full year 2005 was $32.9 million or $0.07 per share, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.01 per share in 2004.
In connection with Atmel's continuing efforts to consolidate manufacturing operations and reduce costs, the Company recorded restructuring and impairment charges of $28.2 million in the fourth quarter. This primarily reflects the loss on sale of its manufacturing facility in Nantes, France, a write-down of certain assets and costs for restructuring the workforce. These non-recurring charges were offset by a $43.1 million arbitration award against LM Ericsson Telefon, AB, a $5.8 million gain on the sale of a private equity investment and an income tax benefit of $7.5 million during the quarter.
"The second half of 2005 was a turnaround for Atmel, " stated George Perlegos, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are pleased that we achieved revenue growth while reducing products and expenses that are not core to our business. We continued to shift the company's product focus towards the Microcontroller and RF businesses with an added emphasis on security and encryption.
"We began the year with 8,800 employees, ended the year with 8,076 employees and concluded the sale of our Nantes fab. During the fourth quarter, the company improved gross margin, returned to profitability and
 
managed to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing convertible note debt by $81 million. I am pleased with our accomplishments and I am very excited about our business as we continue our momentum into 2006, " concluded Mr. Perlegos.
Outlook
The Company anticipates that for the first quarter of 2006, revenues should be about flat to down 2% on a sequential basis, reflecting normal seasonality. Gross margins should be in the range of 29 to 31%, a result of a slight mix change as well as increasingly competitive pricing in the Smart Card sector. Additionally, R&D expense should be approximately $68 to 70 million, while SG&A expense should be between $45 to 47 million. Net interest expense for the first quarter should be approximately $5 to 7 million, while the income tax provision should be in the range of $4 to 6 million. We anticipate that depreciation and amortization will be in the range of $61 to 63 million.
Teleconference
Atmel will hold a teleconference for the financial community at 2:00 PM PST today to discuss fourth quarter financial results. The conference call will be webcast live and can also be monitored by dialing 1-800-374-0405.

When the Facility Agent is satisfied that the conditions specified in this Clause 3.1 have been fulfilled, the Facility Agent will notify the Borrower.
In addition to the conditions precedent set out in Clause 3.1 (), no Lender shall be under any obligation to permit any Utilisation to the Borrower under this Agreement:
Initial Conditions Precedent
 
 
 
the Borrower may, whilst the circumstance giving rise to the requirement or indemnification continues, give the Facility Agent notice of cancellation of the Commitment of that Lender and its intention to procure the repayment of that Lender's participation in the Utilisations.
 
the Borrower shall procure that, immediately following the date that the Facility Agent notifies the Borrower of such determination, an amount equal to the amount of such excess is applied in prepayment of the outstanding Utilisations.
 
Interest will accrue from day to day and shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 360 days.
 
 
For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no Cancellation Fee due if the cancellation is made on or after the third anniversary of the date hereof.
 
then the Borrower shall, within five Business Days of a demand by the Facility Agent, pay for the account of such Finance Party an amount sufficient to indemnify such Finance Party or its Affiliate for such reduction in the rate of return, such increased or additional cost or such reduction in the amount payable under a Finance Document.
 
then interest shall accrue on each Lender's participation in such LIBOR Loan during such Interest Period at the rate which is the aggregate of:
per annum
 
 
 
then such Obligor shall, as an independent obligation, within five Business Days after demand, indemnify such Finance Party for any cost, loss, expense or liability incurred by such Finance Party as a result of such conversion, including any such cost, loss or liability arising from a difference between (A) the rate of exchange used to convert such amount from one currency to the other currency and (B) the rate of exchange available to such Finance Party at the time of receipt by such Finance Party of such amount.
 
 
 
 
and any amount received or recovered by such Guarantor as a result of any such right shall be held in trust and (and in circumstances where trust arrangements are not recognised as a matter of applicable local law) as agent for the Finance Parties and immediately paid to the Facility Agent.
 
 
The obligations and liabilities of the Obligors to the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents shall be secured for the duration of the Term by the interests and rights granted in favour of the Security Agent, , as agent and/or, as the case may be, trustee for the Finance Parties under the Security Documents.
inter alia
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Majority Lenders (acting reasonably), as long as any Obligations or any Commitments remain outstanding each Obligor agrees to the following undertakings with each of the Finance Parties.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Majority Lenders, as long as any Obligations or any Commitment remain outstanding, without the written consent of the Majority Lenders, the Borrower and each Guarantor (to the extent specified) agrees the following undertakings with each of the Finance Parties.
 
 
 
 
Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Majority Lenders as long as any Obligations or any Commitments remain outstanding, the Borrower and each Guarantor (to the extent specified) agrees to the following undertakings with each of the Finance Parties.
 
 
 
 
 
in each case by reason of an event of default (howsoever described).
 
 
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, the Facility Agent may (and, if so instructed by the Majority Lenders, shall) by written notice to the Borrower:
 
If, pursuant to Clause 22.2 (), the Facility Agent declares the Utilisations to be due and payable on demand of the Facility Agent, then, and at any time thereafter, the Facility Agent may (and, if so instructed by the Majority Lenders, shall) by written notice to the Borrower:
Acceleration and Cancellation
 
Except as specifically provided in the Finance Documents, the Arranger has no obligations of any kind to any other party under or in connection with any Finance Document.
The Agents and the Arranger may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with any member of the Group.
 
No Agent or the Arranger nor any of their respective personnel or agents with respect to any other Finance Party:
 
Each Lender shall (in proportion to its share of the Total Commitments at the relevant time or, if the Total Commitments are then zero, to its share of the Total Commitments immediately prior to their reduction to zero) indemnify each Agent, within three Business Days after demand, against any and all costs, losses or liabilities or expenses incurred by such Agent (otherwise than by reason of such Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct) in performing its respective duties, obligations and responsibilities under the Finance Documents and acting as an Agent under the Finance Documents (unless such Agent has been reimbursed by an Obligor pursuant to any other provisions hereof or any other Finance Document).
 
Each Agent shall have the same rights and powers with respect to its participation in the Finance Documents as any other Finance Party and may exercise those rights and powers as if it were not also acting as an Agent.
 
Without affecting the responsibility of any Obligor for information supplied by it or on its behalf in connection with any Finance Document, each Lender confirms to the Facility Agent, the Security Agent and the Arranger that it has been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with any Finance Document including:
If any party owes an amount to an Agent under the Finance Documents the relevant Agent may, after giving notice to that party, deduct an amount not exceeding that amount from any payment to that party which the Agent would otherwise be obliged to make under the Finance Documents and apply the amount deducted in or towards satisfaction of the amount owed. For the purposes of the Finance Documents that party shall be regarded as having received any amount so deducted.
No provision of this Agreement will:
 
 
Lender pursuant to Clause 24.1 () and such debt shall be immediately due and payable.
Payments to Lenders
If any part of any payment made by a Lender pursuant to Clause 24.1 () becomes repayable and is repaid by such Lender, then:
Payments to Lenders
Each Hedging Bank agrees with the Lenders (but not with the Borrower or any other member of the Group) that it will not terminate any Hedging Agreement to which it is a party (each such Hedging Agreement being a "") except:
relevant Hedging Agreement
 
This Agreement shall be binding upon and enure to the benefit of each party hereto and its or any subsequent successors, Transferees and assigns.
Any Lender may, at any time, assign all or any of its rights and benefits hereunder or transfer in accordance with Clause 26.4 () without the consent of an Obligor all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations hereunder to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund, or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets; no such assignment or transfer may be made without consultation with the Borrower, except in the case of any such assignment or transfer:
Transfers by Lenders
provided that
provided, further, that written notification of any such assignment or transfer shall be delivered to the Borrower by the acceding Lender as soon as reasonably practicable following consummation of such assignment or transfer.
 
then the Transferee is only entitled to receive payment under those Clauses to the same extent as the Transferor would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.
If a Transferor wishes to transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and/or obligations hereunder as contemplated in Clause 26.2 (), then such transfer may be effected by the delivery to the Facility Agent of a duly completed and duly executed Transfer Certificate in which event (subject to paragraph (b) of Clause 26.3 ()), on the later of the Transfer Date specified in such Transfer Certificate and the fifth Business Day after (or such earlier Business Day endorsed by the Facility Agent on such Transfer Certificate falling on or after) the date of delivery of such Transfer Certificate to the Facility Agent:
Assignments and Transfers by Lenders
Conditions of Assignment or Transfer
 
On, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, the date upon which a transfer takes effect pursuant to Clause 26.4 () the Facility Agent shall send to the Borrower a copy of the relevant Transfer Certificate.
Transfers by Lenders
On the date upon which a transfer takes effect pursuant to Clause 26.4 () the Transferee in respect of such transfer shall pay to the Facility Agent for its own account a transfer fee of US$3,500.
Transfers by Lenders
Subject to Clause 35 (), any Lender may disclose to any actual or potential assignee or Transferee or to any person who may otherwise enter into contractual relations with such Lender in relation to this Agreement (but not otherwise) such information about the Obligors and the Group as such Lender shall consider appropriate.
Confidentiality
If any Lender assigns or otherwise transfers all or any part of its rights or obligations under this Agreement as provided in Clause 26.4 () and such Lender is a Hedging Bank at the time of such assignment or transfer, it shall, notwithstanding such assignment or transfer, remain a Hedging Bank in respect of the Hedging Agreements which it entered into while it was a Lender and shall remain a party to this Agreement in such capacity.
Transfers by Lenders
     If a Lender assigns or transfers any of its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents and as a result of circumstances existing at the date of assignment or transfer, an Obligor would be obliged to make a payment to the new Lender under Clause 13.1 (), then the new Lender is only entitled to receive payment in respect of such clause to the same extent as the assignor Lender would have been if the assignment or transfer had not occurred.
Taxes
 
Except in connection with a Permitted Transaction no Obligor shall be entitled to assign or transfer all or any of its rights, benefits and obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of all Lenders).
Each payment received by the Facility Agent under the Finance Documents for another person shall, subject to Clause 28.3 () and Clause 30.4 (), be made available by the Facility Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the person entitled to receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that person may notify to the Facility Agent by not less than five Business Days notice with a bank in London.
Distributions to an Obligor
Clawback
The Facility Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with Clause 29 ()) apply any amount received by it from that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under the Finance Documents or, in the event that such receipts are not in US Dollars, in or towards purchase of US Dollars to be so applied.
Set-Off
 
All payments to be made by an Obligor under the Finance Documents shall be calculated and be made without (and free and clear of any deduction for) set-off or counterclaim.
 
If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this Agreement shall, to the extent that the Facility Agent (acting reasonably and after consultation with the Borrower) deems necessary, be amended to comply with any generally accepted conventions and market practices in the London interbank market and otherwise to reflect the change in currency.
Following the occurrence of an Event of Default that is continuing, a Finance Party may (but, for the avoidance of doubt, is not obliged to) set off any matured obligation due from an Obligor under the Finance Documents (to the extent beneficially owned by that Finance Party) against any matured obligation owed by that Finance Party to that Obligor, regardless of the place of payment, booking branch or currency of either obligation. If the obligations are in different currencies, the Finance Party may convert either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off. The rights specified above are in addition to and not in substitution for rights arising by operation of law.
The Borrower shall, from time to time within 45 days of written demand, reimburse each of the Facility Agent, the Security Agent, the Lenders and the Arranger for all reasonable costs and expenses (including the fees, costs and expenses of their legal and other advisers and field examiners) together with any VAT thereon incurred by it in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, syndication and perfection of this Agreement and any other Finance Document (whether referred to in this Agreement or executed after the date of this Agreement) and the completion of the transactions contemplated herein or therein; provided that the fees, costs and expenses of the Finance Parties' legal advisers so incurred to the Signing Date shall be paid out of the first Utilisation of the Facility conditional upon delivery of a written invoice detailing the amounts incurred.
The Borrower shall, from time to time on demand, reimburse the Facility Agent, the Security Agent and each of the other Finance Parties for all costs and expenses (including legal fees) together with any VAT thereon incurred in or in connection with the preservation and/or enforcement of any of their rights under this Agreement or any other Finance Document.
The Facility Agent and the Security Agent shall be entitled to compensation (based on an hourly or daily rate for each of its employees or agents as the Facility Agent may from time to time determine) for time spent directly or indirectly (a) in connection with the enforcement of Security and exercise of other remedies by way of enforcement following an Event of Default
 
and/or (b) in connection with the collection or management of Receivables at any time permitted under the Finance Documents. In addition, the Borrower shall, from time to time on demand of the Facility Agent and without prejudice to the provisions of Clause 30.2 () and Clause 30.4 () compensate the Facility Agent for all reasonable costs and expenses (including travel, lodging and meal costs) and field exam costs and audit at the Security Agent's Customary rate (such charges currently $950 per day for each person so employed) and expenses incurred by the Facility Agent or its agents, delegates or nominees in connection with its taking such action as it may, acting reasonably, deem appropriate or in complying with any instructions from the Majority Lenders in connection with:
Preservation and Enforcement of Rights
Amendment Costs
If the Borrower requests any amendment, supplement, forbearance, consent or waiver in accordance with Clause 31 () then the Borrower shall, on demand, reimburse the Facility Agent, the Security Agent and each of the other Finance Parties for all reasonable costs and expenses (including the fees, costs and expenses of their legal and other advisers) together with any VAT thereon incurred by the Facility Agent, the Security Agent or such other Finance Party in responding to, evaluating, negotiating or complying with such request or in connection with that required amendment, supplement, forbearance, consent or waiver (in each case, whether or not actually executed or granted).
Amendments and Waivers
     If the Borrower fails to perform any of its obligations under this Clause 30, each Lender shall, in the proportion that the amount of its Commitments bears to the Total Commitments, indemnify each of the Facility Agent, the Security Agent and the Arranger against any loss incurred by any of them as a result of such failure and the Borrower shall forthwith reimburse each Lender for any payment made by it pursuant to this Clause 30.
 
No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of the Facility Agent, the Security Agent or any other Finance Party, any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy prevent any further or other exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative
 
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law. A waiver given or consent granted by any Finance Party under the Finance Documents will be effective only if given in writing and only in the instance and for the specific purpose for which it is given.
Each communication to be made hereunder shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated, shall be made by fax or letter.
Any communication or document to be made or delivered by one person to another pursuant to this Agreement shall in the case of any person other than a Lender (unless that other person has by 15 days written notice to the Facility Agent specified another address) be made or delivered to that other person at the address identified with its signature below or, in the case of a Lender, at the address from time to time designated by it to the Facility Agent for the purpose of this Agreement (or, in the case of a Transferee at the end of the Transfer Certificate to which it is a party as Transferee) and shall be deemed to have been made or delivered when received (in the case of any communication made by fax) or (in the case of any communication made by letter) when left at the address or (as the case may be) five days after being deposited in the post, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to it at that address; that any communication or document to be made or delivered to the Facility Agent shall be effective only when received by the Facility Agent and then only if the same is expressly marked for the attention of the department or officer identified with the Facility Agent's signature below (or such other department or officer as the Facility Agent shall from time to time specify for this purpose).

If any provision hereof is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any respect under the law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction shall in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

(iii) Settlement of Third Party Claims

The information contained in Item 5.02 regarding Steven Laub's employment agreement is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
Departure of Executive Officers
Atmel Corporation (the "Company") has announced that on August 5, 2006, the Board of Directors terminated four officers of the Company:
The Board's decision was made following an independent investigation into allegations regarding the misuse of corporate travel funds. Messrs. George Perlegos and Gust Perlegos have been asked to resign as members of the Company's Board of Directors.
Appointment of Executive Officer
The Company also announced that on August 6, 2006, the Board of Directors appointed Steven Laub as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Laub, 47, has served as a director of the Company since February 10, 2006. He most recently was a technology partner at Golden Gate Capital Corporation, a private equity buyout firm, and the Executive Chairman of Teridian Semiconductor Corporation, a fabless semiconductor company. From 2004 to 2005, Mr. Laub was President and Chief Executive Officer of Silicon Image, Inc., a provider of semiconductor solutions. Prior to that time, Mr. Laub spent 13 years in executive positions (including President, Chief Operating Officer and member of the Board of Directors) at Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, a supplier of programmable logic devices and related software. Prior to joining Lattice Semiconductor, Mr. Laub was a partner at Bain and Company, a global strategic consulting firm. Mr. Laub holds a degree in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles (BA) and a degree from Harvard Law School (JD).
In connection with Mr. Laub's appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, he entered into an employment agreement with the Company (the "Agreement") under which he will serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commencing August 7, 2006. Mr. Laub will report to the Company's Board of Directors and will render such business and professional services in the performance of his duties, consistent with his position within the Company, as will reasonably be assigned to him by the Board. The Company has agreed to nominate Mr. Laub for re-election as a member of the Board at each annual meeting during the term of the Agreement.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Laub will be paid an annual base salary of $700,000, subject to annual review. Mr. Laub will be eligible to receive annual cash incentives payable for the achievement of performance goals established by the Board or by the Compensation Committee of the Board; his target annual incentive will be not less than 100% of his annual base salary. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors has granted Mr. Laub an option to purchase 1,450,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock as of August 7, 2006 at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price per share on The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") for the Company's Common Stock on August 7, 2006. Twenty five percent (25%) of the shares subject to this option shall vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant, and 1/48th of the shares subject to this option shall vest monthly thereafter, assuming Mr. Laub's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date.
Table of Contents
In addition, the Company has agreed to use its commercially reasonable best efforts to secure approval from the Nasdaq for the grant of an additional option to purchase 2,550,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the Nasdaq for the Common Stock of the Company on the date of grant (the "Stand-Alone Grant"). Twenty five percent (25%) of the shares subject to this option would vest on August 7, 2007, and the remainder of the shares subject to this option would vest pro-rata monthly over the three (3) year period commencing on August 7, 2007, assuming Mr. Laub's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date.
If the Company does not receive Nasdaq approval of the Stand-Alone Grant by December 31, 2006, then on January 2, 2007 (assuming Mr. Laub is still employed by the Company), the Company will grant to Mr. Laub (i) an option to purchase an additional 500,000 shares of Common Stock at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the Nasdaq for the Company's Common Stock on January 2, 2007 (the "Additional Option") and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of restricted stock (or restricted stock units) (the "Restricted Stock"). Twenty five percent (25%) of the shares subject to the Additional Option would vest on August 7, 2007, and the remainder of the shares subject to the Additional Option would vest pro-rata monthly over the three (3) year period commencing on August 7, 2007, assuming Mr. Laub's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date. Twenty five percent (25%) of the Restricted Stock would vest on August 7, 2007, and the remainder of the Restricted Stock would vest pro-rata quarterly over the three (3) year period commencing on August 7, 2007, assuming Mr. Laub's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date.
Mr. Laub will be eligible to participate in accordance with the terms of all Company employee benefit plans, policies and arrangements that are applicable to other executive officers of the Company, as such plans, policies and arrangements may exist from time to time.
The Agreement provides for certain payments and benefits to be provided to Mr. Laub in the event that he is terminated without "cause" or that he resigns for "good reason," including if such actions occur in connection with a "change of control," as each such term is defined in the Agreement.
The Agreement contains covenants for the benefit of the Company relating to non-solicitation, non-competition, non-disparagement and the protection of the Company's confidential information.
Appointment of Non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors
The Company also announced that on August 6, 2006, the Board of Directors appointed David Sugishita as Non-executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr. Sugishita has served as a director of the Company since February 2004.

San Jose, CA, August 7, 2006
Mr. Laub's appointment follows the unanimous decision of the Board's independent directors to terminate George Perlegos, as President and Chief Executive Officer; Gust Perlegos, as Executive Vice President, Office of the President; the Vice President and General Counsel and Assistant Secretary; and the Vice President of Planning and Information Technology. The Board's decision was made following an independent investigation into allegations regarding the misuse of corporate travel funds. Messrs.

"We are pleased that Steve will share his knowledge and significant strategic planning, operating, and financial experience with our Company," said David Sugishita, director and newly appointed Non-executive Chairman of the Board of Atmel.

We understand the challenges ahead and are committed to successfully addressing them. Atmel's solid operating performance demonstrates that Atmel's customers have confidence in our Company, our people and our products."
 
 
"Thanks to the hard work and dedication of Atmel's employees, our base business remains sound," said Robert Avery, Atmel's Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer. "We have introduced a number of new products over the past few months that we believe will help us maintain this positive momentum. We are also making progress on our efforts to refocus on high-growth markets, lower costs and improve efficiencies. By staying focused on our goals, we are confident that Atmel will continue capturing the opportunities in our marketplace."

Mr. Laub holds a degree in economics from the University of California, Los Angeles (BA) and a degree from Harvard Law School (JD).
Atmel stated that today's announcement is unrelated to the Company's July 25, 2006 announcement that the Board's Audit Committee, together with independent legal counsel and independent accounting consultants, is conducting an investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. The Audit Committee's investigation is ongoing and, as previously announced, the Company does not expect the investigation to be completed prior to the due date for the Company's second-quarter Form 10-Q, August 9, 2006, or the extended due date of August 14, 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML), a global leader in the development and fabrication of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced unaudited selected financial information for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006.
SAN JOSE, CA, August 17, 2006
Revenues for the second quarter of 2006 totaled $464.3 million, a sequential increase of 6.3% compared to the $436.8 million reported in the first quarter of 2006, and a 12.6% increase compared to the $412.2 million reported in the second quarter of 2005. At June 30, 2006, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $310.3 million, following redemption of all outstanding convertible subordinated debentures during the quarter ended June 30, 2006.
"I am very pleased to be part of the Atmel organization and to be able to say that we delivered a quarter highlighted by strong sequential revenue results," stated Steven Laub, Atmel's newly appointed President and Chief Executive Officer. "During the second quarter, our proprietary AVR microcontroller revenues grew 26% over the first quarter of 2006 and we saw continued strength in our RF and ASIC businesses. On July 12, 2006, we entered into an agreement to sell our Grenoble, France subsidiary to e2v technologies plc for $140 million and on August 1, 2006, announced the completion of the sale. This represents an important step in our plan to focus resources on our core technologies."
"Atmel continues to execute to its plan to drive both operating and financial improvement, " said Robert Avery, Atmel's Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer. "During the first six months of this fiscal year we increased revenues over 8% compared to the same period last year, eliminated all subordinated convertible debt and exited the quarter with over $300 million in cash and short-term
 
investments. We continue to make significant progress strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our resources as we target profitable growth."
The Company announced on July 25, 2006, that the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors had initiated an independent investigation regarding timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. The Audit Committee is being assisted by independent legal counsel and independent accounting consultants and will make every effort to complete the investigation as soon as practicable. The financial information in this release was compiled by the management of Atmel Corporation and has not been audited or reviewed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The financial information is preliminary and subject to potentially material adjustment depending on the outcome of the investigation. Any reliance placed on this unaudited and unreviewed financial information is to be done with the full understanding and acceptance of the foregoing uncertainties. As a result of the continuing investigation, the Company did not file its second quarter Form 10-Q by the extended due date of August 14, 2006, and is unable to provide additional financial information for the second quarter of 2006 at this time.
Second Quarter 2006 and Recent Highlights
The Company anticipates that for the third quarter of 2006, core revenues should be seasonally flat on a sequential basis. However, when reflecting the recent sale of our Grenoble, France subsidiary, announced on August 1, 2006, total revenues will be down approximately 4% to 6% when compared to the second quarter of 2006.
Outlook
Atmel is a worldwide leader in the design and manufacture of microcontrollers, advanced logic, mixed-signal, nonvolatile memory and radio frequency (RF) components. Leveraging one of the industry's broadest intellectual property (IP) technology portfolios, Atmel is able to provide the electronics industry with complete system solutions.

Sincerely,

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On September 29, 2006, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") adopted an executive bonus plan for fiscal year 2006. The executive bonus plan is a cash incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the Company's financial and other performance objectives, and to reward them for their achievements when those objectives are met. All of the Company's executive officers are eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan. Target bonuses range from 50% to 100% of an executive's base salary, and the amount of the target bonus actually paid to an executive officer will be based on the achievement of (i) certain Company performance objectives tied to the Company's annual revenue and operating profit, (ii) certain individual performance objectives approved by the Compensation Committee, and (iii) for some executive officers, a Company performance objective tied to the Company's gross margin, and/or certain business unit objectives tied to the business unit's annual revenue and operating profit, or certain objectives tied to sales region billings. The executive bonus plan also provides for increases in an executive officer's bonus which depend on (a) the Company meeting both its annual revenue and operating profit objectives, and in addition meeting or exceeding certain higher thresholds for the Company, business unit performance and/or sales region billing objectives applicable to the executive officer, or (b) the executive officer's performance relative to his individual performance objectives. The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2006, if any, will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce or increase the bonus that would otherwise be payable based on actual performance. However, no bonuses will be paid under the executive bonus plan if the Company does not achieve an annual operating profit (excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and certain legal and accounting expenses). The aggregate maximum amount of bonuses payable under the executive bonus plan to the Company's executive officers who are covered by Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is approximately $3.19 million.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 4.02(a). Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
As previously announced on July 25, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") initiated an independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting experts, has reached a preliminary determination that, in connection with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB25"), the actual measurement dates for certain stock options differed from the recorded measurement dates for such stock options. The Audit Committee has not completed its work nor reached final conclusions and is continuing its investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the differences.
Based on the Audit Committee's preliminary determination, the Company expects that the difference in these measurement dates will result in material non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses. Any such charges would have the effect of decreasing net income or increasing net loss and increasing accumulated deficit as reported in the Company's historical financial statements. Accordingly, on October 24, 2006, the Company's Audit Committee, after consultation with management, determined that the Company's financial statements for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2005, which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, the financial statements for the interim periods contained in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with respect to each of these years, and the financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2006, should no longer be relied upon. In addition, the restatement will affect financial statements for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2003 and, therefore, financial statements for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2003 should also no longer be relied upon. The Company expects to reflect the impact of the adjustments to those prior periods as an adjustment to the opening balances as of January 1, 2003 in the financial statements for the restatement period.
Because the Audit Committee's investigation is ongoing, it has not identified all stock options for which the accounting measurement dates may have been incorrectly determined. As a result, the Company has not determined the final aggregate amount of additional stock-based compensation expenses that may need to be recorded or the amount of such expenses that may need to be recorded in any specific prior period or in any future period. Further, there can be no assurance that no other matters will come to the attention of the Audit Committee during the course of its investigation that will require additional adjustments to the Company's financial statements.
The Company has not yet determined the tax consequences that may result from these matters or whether tax consequences will give rise to monetary liabilities which may have to be satisfied in any future period.
Additionally, the Company is evaluating Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting as disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005, but has not yet completed its analysis of the impact of this situation on its internal control over financial reporting.
The Audit Committee and the Company's management have discussed the matters disclosed in this Current Report on Form 8-K with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee is making every effort to complete its investigation, and the Company will make every effort to file its restated financial statements as soon as practicable after the completion of the investigation.
A copy of the press release relating to this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML), a global leader in the development and fabrication of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced unaudited selected financial information for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006.
SAN JOSE, CA, November 2, 2006
Revenues for the third quarter of 2006 totaled $443 million, a sequential decrease of 5% compared to the $464 million reported in the second quarter of 2006, and a 6% increase compared to the $419 million reported in the third quarter of 2005. At September 30, 2006, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $484 million. During the quarter, the Company announced that it concluded the sale of its Grenoble, France subsidiary for $140 million to e2v technologies plc, a British corporation.
Third Quarter 2006 and Recent Highlights
 
"Although our third quarter revenues declined 5% on a sequential basis, when you exclude the effect of Grenoble, our revenues were on target sequentially and up 10% when compared to the same period last year," stated Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "With the sale of Grenoble concluded, we are focused on redeploying our resources to grow core technologies and expect this will lead to continued market share gains."
"Cash and equivalents increased $174 million during the third quarter reflecting the proceeds received from the sale of our Grenoble business unit as well as operating cash flows generated during the quarter," said Robert Avery, Atmel's Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer. "Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and our operating leverage is expanding."
As previously announced on July 25, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors initiated an independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting experts, has reached a preliminary determination that, in connection with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB25"), the actual measurement dates for certain stock options differed from the recorded measurement dates for such stock options. Based on the Audit Committee's preliminary determination, the Company expects that the difference in these measurement dates will result in material non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses. The Audit Committee has not completed its work nor reached final conclusions and is continuing its investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the differences.
The financial information in this release was compiled by the management of Atmel Corporation and has not been audited or reviewed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The financial information is preliminary and subject to potentially material adjustment depending on the outcome of the investigation. Any reliance placed on this unaudited and unreviewed financial information is to be done with the full understanding and acceptance of the foregoing uncertainties. As a result of the continuing investigation, the Company does not believe it will file its third quarter Form 10-Q by the extended due date of November 14, 2006, and is unable to provide additional financial information for the third quarter of 2006 at this time.
Outlook
The Company anticipates that fourth quarter 2006 revenues will likely decline approximately 3% to 8% sequentially. However, excluding the effect of Grenoble, revenues are anticipated to decline in the range of 0% to 5% on a sequential basis.
 
Conference Call
Atmel will hold a teleconference at 2:00 p.m. PT today to discuss third quarter selected financial results. The conference call will be webcast live and can also be monitored by dialing 1-800-374-0405 or 1-706-634-5185.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
On November 14, 2006, Atmel Corporation (the "Company") received an additional staff determination notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market stating that the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing requirements set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), due to the Company's delay in filing its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006. The notice stated that the delay in filing could serve as an additional basis for delisting of the Company's securities.
As previously disclosed, Nasdaq initially informed the Company on August 14, 2006 that its securities would be delisted due to the Company's delay in filing its Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006 unless the Company requested a hearing in accordance with applicable Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Company subsequently requested and was granted a hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel") on September 26, 2006 to request an extension for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As of November 20, 2006, the Company is awaiting a decision on its extension request. While the Company remains optimistic, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant a request for continued listing. Shares of the Company's common stock will continue trading on the Nasdaq pending the Panel's decision.
As previously announced on July 25, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors initiated an independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. The Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting experts, has reached a preliminary determination that, in connection with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB25"), the actual measurement dates for certain stock options differed from the recorded measurement dates for such stock options. Based on the Audit Committee's preliminary determination, the Company expects that the difference in these measurement dates will result in material non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses. The Company filed a Form 8-K on October 30, 2006 disclosing the decision of the Audit Committee that prior financial statements should no longer be relied upon.
The Audit Committee has not completed its work nor reached final conclusions and is continuing its investigation into the circumstances that gave rise to the differences. The Audit Committee is making every effort to complete its investigation, and the Company will make every effort to file its restated financial statements as soon as practicable after the completion of the investigation.

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On December 7, 2006, the board of directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") approved, and on December 12, 2006 the Company announced, several strategic restructuring initiatives in order to enhance profitability, accelerate the Company's growth and reduce costs. The Company plans to optimize its manufacturing operations by selling its North Tyneside, United Kingdom and Heilbronn, Germany wafer fabrication facilities and adopt a "fab-lite" manufacturing model by expanding the Company's foundry relationships and better utilizing the Company's remaining wafer fabrication facilities. In addition, the Company plans to implement a workforce reduction plan through a combination of voluntary resignations, attrition and other actions.
The workforce reduction plan is expected to result in a reduction of approximately 300 employees, or 10%, of the Company's non-manufacturing workforce and be completed by the end of 2007. The Company cannot predict with certainty the expected completion date of the sale of its North Tyneside and Heilbronn facilities. The Company expects headcount to be reduced by approximately 1,000 additional employees upon the completion of sales of its North Tyneside and Heilbronn facilities.
The Company estimates that it will record restructuring and impairment charges in excess of $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 for fixed-asset write downs, severance and other expenses associated with the restructuring. Of this amount, approximately $20 million to $30 million will be related to severance and other expenses associated with the workforce reduction plan. The Company currently is not able to estimate the impairment charge associated with the sale of the North Tyneside, United Kingdom fabrication facility; however, the Company expects it will be significant. The Company currently does not expect the sale of the Heilbronn, Germany fabrication facility to result in an impairment charge.
A copy of the press release relating to this announcement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments
The information contained in Item 2.05 regarding the impairment charge associated with the sale of the North Tyneside, United Kingdom fabrication facility is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 8.01 Other Events
On December 11, 2006, the Company issued a press release entitled "Atmel Granted Conditional Nasdaq Listing." A copy of this press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML), a global leader in the development and fabrication of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced strategic restructuring initiatives designed to enhance profitability, accelerate the company's growth and reduce costs. These initiatives include:
SAN JOSE, CA, December 12, 2006
The company anticipates cost savings in the range of $70 million to $80 million in 2007 reaching an annual rate of $80 million to $95 million by 2008. Included in the cost savings is approximately $55 million per year resulting from the expected sale of the wafer fabrication facilities. Through a combination of voluntary resignations, attrition and other actions, Atmel expects a reduction in its non-
 
 
manufacturing workforce of approximately 300 employees, or ten percent. The company anticipates headcount to be reduced by approximately 1,000 additional employees upon completion of the sales of the North Tyneside and Heilbronn wafer fabrication facilities.
Atmel will continue to meet the production needs of its worldwide customer base during this transition through the use of internal capacity and existing foundry partners. In addition, Atmel anticipates entering into a transition sourcing agreement with the eventual buyers of the wafer fabrication facilities.
"These initiatives follow a thorough analysis of the company's operations and strongest opportunities for growth," said Steven Laub, Atmel president and CEO. "While this decision was difficult given the company's many dedicated employees, these actions are essential to better position Atmel to compete and drive value for our shareholders. Focusing on our core business competencies, expanding our foundry relationships and the adoption of a fab-lite model are the right strategies for Atmel to better serve our customers, reduce manufacturing costs and enhance shareholder value."
As a result of the initiatives announced today, the company estimates it will record one-time restructuring and impairment charges in excess of $200 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 for fixed asset write-downs, severance and other expenses associated with the restructuring. A significant portion of these non-recurring charges relate to the non-cash write-down of the North Tyneside manufacturing facility Atmel intends to sell.
Atmel will hold a teleconference at 6:00 a.m. PT tomorrow, December 13 to discuss today's announcement. The conference call will be webcast live at and can be monitored by dialing 1-800-374-0405 or 1-706-634-5185. The conference ID number is 4088283.

Exhibit 99.2
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML), a global leader in the development and fabrication of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced that the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel has granted the company's request for continued listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market subject to certain conditions.
SAN JOSE, CA, December 11, 2006
On or before February 9, 2007 Atmel must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission its Forms 10-Q for its second quarter ended June 30, 2006 and third quarter ended September 30, 2006 as well as any necessary restatements for prior financial periods. The company must also be able to demonstrate compliance with all other requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq Stock Market. In granting the extension, the Panel has required that through February 9, 2007 Atmel notify the Panel of the occurrence of any significant events, including any event that may call into question Atmel's historical financial information or impact the company's ability to comply with any NASDAQ listing requirement or satisfy the February 9, 2007 deadline. In addition, any submissions to the Panel, press releases, or public filings prepared by Atmel will be subject to review by the Panel, which may, at its discretion, request additional information before determining that Atmel has complied with the terms of the Panel's decision.
As previously announced on July 25, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors initiated an independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues.

Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
As previously announced on July 25, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") initiated an independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. On October 30, 2006, the Company announced that the Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting experts, had reached a preliminary determination that, in connection with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, the actual measurement dates for certain stock options differed from the recorded measurement dates for such stock options. The Audit Committee has not completed its work nor reached final conclusions, including with regard to the accounting and tax implications of the stock option investigation.
Effective December 29, 2006, the Company permitted certain named executive officers and certain other executive officers specified below to elect to amend certain terms of their stock option grant agreements. The amendments were undertaken in order to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to this group of officers and the Company associated with stock options for which the actual measurement dates differed from the recorded measurement dates for such stock options and such options were granted at a discount to the value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant ("discount options"). The timing of the amendments was dictated by potential tax consequences under proposed regulations recently promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service under Section 409A. Such proposed regulations require that Section 16 officers and directors (under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) resolve certain option issues by December 31, 2006. Therefore, the Company permitted such amendments based on the findings of the investigation related to the discount options to meet this deadline although the investigation has not been completed. As such, the amendments listed below are contingent elections and will only take effect if the findings of the stock option investigation ultimately show that the options in question were in fact discount options.
Certain stock option grants for the individuals listed below were amended to provide for a fixed exercise in calendar year 2007 or a subsequent year, or earlier upon separation of service or change in control, as detailed in the form Stock Option Fixed Exercise Date Election Form filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.
The Company expects that other officers and employees may enter into agreements with the Company to mitigate potential Section 409A liability in 2007, in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service regulations affecting non-Section 16 employees with affected outstanding stock options, assuming there are no further legislative or regulatory developments.

Exhibit 10.1
PLEASE NOTE THAT BY YOUR SIGNATURE BELOW, YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS ELECTION FORM AND ALL ACCOMPANYING DOCUMENTS.
:
Instructions
This election may be necessary to protect you from penalty taxes that may be imposed on you under new Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the new law, if you hold stock options that vest after December 31, 2004 that were not granted with an exercise price equal to at least the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant ("discount options") the portion of the stock options that vests after December 31, 2004 does not comply with Section 409A and, unless the options are corrected, your gain with respect to the affected portion of your option will be includible in your taxable income prior to exercise, and will be subject to regular state and federal taxes plus a 20% federal penalty tax and interest charges. However, under special transition rules designed by the IRS to protect taxpayers from such adverse tax consequences, you are permitted to make an irrevocable election to specify the year (after 2006) in which you would exercise your options (although this exercise date could be accelerated by any change in control of the Company or by your termination of service).
Please select one of the Election alternatives below and complete the required information, and submit the form. If you do not make an Election below, you will be liable for any taxes resulting from your discount options.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML), a global leader in the development and fabrication of advanced semiconductor solutions, today announced unaudited selected financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. All revenues exclude those provided by the Company's Grenoble subsidiary which was sold in July, 2006.
SAN JOSE, CA, February 1, 2007
Revenues, excluding Grenoble, for the fourth quarter of 2006 totaled $408.9 million, a sequential decrease of 5% compared to the $429.4 million reported in the third quarter of 2006, and a 4% increase compared to the $394.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Revenues, excluding Grenoble, for the year totaled $1.67 billion, representing a 7% increase over the $1.56 billion reported in 2005. The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $466.7 million at December 31, 2006.
Fourth Quarter 2006 and Recent Highlights
 
"The fourth quarter was challenging as customers adjusted their ordering activity late in the quarter to balance their inventory levels," stated Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "The restructuring and cost-savings initiatives announced in December will help us successfully manage through the general market weakness that is expected to continue into the first quarter of 2007. Looking at the coming year and beyond, we are confident that our industry leading technology and new strategy will position Atmel for continued growth."
"Atmel's balance sheet remains strong. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $466.7 million at year-end, an increase of $128.1 million over the $338.6 million at December 31, 2005," said Robert Avery, Atmel's Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer. "Additionally, our cash position, net of debt, grew by $347.1 million as we redeemed all outstanding convertible debt and generated cash from operations and from the sale of our Grenoble subsidiary."
Outlook
The Company anticipates that for the first quarter of 2007 revenues will likely decline approximately 4% to 8% on a sequential basis as customers continue to work through current inventory levels.
As previously announced, the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council, acting pursuant to its discretionary authority under NASDAQ Rule 4807(b), has called for review the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel decision that established a deadline of February 9, 2007, for Atmel to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, as well as any necessary restatements for prior financial periods. The Listing Council also determined to stay the Panel decision, including the February 9 deadline, as well as future Panel determinations to suspend the Company's securities from trading pending further action by the Listing Council. The Company believes this action will provide it with additional time beyond February 9, 2007 to complete the Company's previously announced independent investigation related to its stock option practices and accounting, and finalize and file with the SEC the delayed quarterly reports and any necessary restatements for prior financial periods. The Listing Council informed the Company that it may submit in writing additional information for the Listing Council's
th
 
consideration. There can be no assurance that the outcome of the Listing Council's review will be favorable to Atmel or that Atmel will remain listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.
As previously announced on July 25, 2006, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors initiated an independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. On October 30, 2006, the Company announced that the Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting experts, had reached a determination that, in connection with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB25"), the actual measurement dates for certain stock options differed from the recorded measurement dates for such stock options. Based on the Audit Committee's determination, the Company expects that the difference in these measurement dates will result in material non-cash, stock-based compensation expenses.
The Audit Committee has not completed its work nor reached final conclusions, including with regard to the accounting and tax implications of the stock option investigation. The Audit Committee is making every effort to complete its investigation, and the Company will make every effort to file its restated financial statements as soon as practicable after the completion of the investigation.
The financial information in this release was compiled by the management of Atmel Corporation and has not been audited or reviewed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The financial information is preliminary and subject to potentially material adjustment depending on the outcome of the investigation. Any reliance placed on this unaudited and unreviewed financial information is to be done with the full understanding and acceptance of the foregoing uncertainties. As a result of the continuing investigation, the Company does not believe it will file its 2006 Form 10-K by the due date of March 1, 2007 and is unable to provide additional financial information for the fourth quarter of 2006 at this time.
Conference Call
Atmel will hold a teleconference at 2:00 p.m. PT today to discuss fourth quarter selected financial results. The conference call will be webcast live and can also be monitored by dialing 1-800-374-0405 or 1-706-634-5185.

The Audit Committee has not completed its work in connection with its review of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues, including with regard to the accounting and tax implications
 
of the stock option investigation, and the determinations discussed in this press release are preliminary. In addition, the investigation and possible conclusions have had and may in the future have an impact on the amount and timing of previously awarded stock-based compensation and other additional expenses to be recorded; accounting adjustments to our financial statements for the periods in question; our ability to file required reports with the SEC on a timely basis; our ability to meet the requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market for continued listing of our shares; potential claims and proceedings relating to such matters, including shareholder or employee litigation and action by the SEC and/or other governmental agencies; and negative tax or other implications for the Company resulting from any accounting adjustments or other factors.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
On March 1, 2007, Atmel filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that it would be unable to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 (the "Form 10-K"). As expected, on March 8, 2007, Atmel received an additional notice of non-compliance from the Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market, in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), due to the delay in the filing of the Form 10-K. As previously announced, Atmel received notices of non-compliance from NASDAQ on August 14, 2006 and November 14, 2006 due to delays in the filing of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, respectively (collectively, the "Forms 10-Q"). The Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K filing delays are attributable to the fact that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is conducting an independent investigation regarding timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues.
As previously disclosed, in response to the first notice of non-compliance, Atmel requested a hearing before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel"). Following the hearing, the Panel granted the Company's request for continued listing subject to the requirements that Atmel provide the Panel with certain information relating to the Audit Committee's investigation, which was submitted to the Panel, and that the Company file the Forms 10-Q and any necessary restatements by February 9, 2007.
On January 22, 2007, the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council (the "Listing Council") determined to call the Company's matter for review. The Listing Council also determined to stay the Panel decision that required the Company to file the Forms 10-Q by February 9, 2007. In connection with the call for review, the Listing Council has now requested that the Company provide an update on its efforts to file the delayed Form 10-K. The Company intends to comply with this request.
The Company is working diligently to complete all necessary filings and thereby demonstrate compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market; however, there can be no assurance that the Listing Council will determine to grant the Company a further extension following its review of the forthcoming submission.
The Audit Committee has not completed its work nor reached final conclusions. The Audit Committee is making every effort to complete its investigation and the Company is making every effort to complete the necessary accounting and reporting. The Company anticipates filing the Forms 10-Q and the Form 10-K by early June 2007 with the SEC. The Company also expects to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2007 as soon as practicable thereafter.

Amendment of Employment Agreement
     On March 13, 2007, Atmel Corporation (the "Company") and Steven Laub, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") of Mr. Laub's employment agreement with the Company dated as of August 6, 2006 (the "Employment Agreement"). Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, the Company was contractually obligated to issue 1,000,000 shares of restricted stock (or restricted stock units) (the "Restricted Stock") to Mr. Laub on January 2, 2007. However, as a result of the Company not being current in its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company suspended the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock pursuant to its registration statements on Forms S-8 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, the Company was unable to issue the Restricted Stock to Mr. Laub on January 2, 2007. The purpose of the Amendment is to provide that Mr. Laub is issued the Restricted Stock, or if that does not occur, to provide that Mr. Laub is compensated as if the Restricted Stock had been issued.
     Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company has agreed to issue the Restricted Stock to Mr. Laub within 10 business days after the Company becomes current in its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, but prior to August 6, 2007. Notwithstanding such delayed issuance, vesting of the Restricted Stock will be on the same dates and schedule set forth in the Employment Agreement. In the event Mr. Laub's employment terminates prior to the issuance of the Restricted Stock, the Company will pay Mr. Laub an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of the portion of the Restricted Stock that would have vested had the Restricted Stock been issued on January 2, 2007, as calculated pursuant to the Amendment.
     The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Employment Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference, and the Amendment, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

     This Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of August 6, 2006, by and between Atmel Corporation (the "Company") and Steven Laub ("Executive").
     1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
          (a) . As of August 7, 2006 (the "Effective Date"), Executive will commence service as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President. Executive will report to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). As of the Effective Date, Executive will render such business and professional services in the performance of his duties, consistent with Executive's position within the Company, as will reasonably be assigned to him by the Board. The period Executive is employed by the Company under this Agreement is referred to herein as the "Employment Term".
Positions and Duties
          (b) . As of the Effective Date, Executive serves as a member of the Board. At each annual meeting of the Company's stockholders during the Employment Term, the Company will nominate Executive to serve as a member of the Board. Executive's service as a member of the Board will be subject to any required stockholder approval. Upon the termination of Executive's employment for any reason, unless otherwise requested by the Board, Executive will be deemed to have resigned from the Board (and all other positions held at the Company and its affiliates) voluntarily, without any further required action by Executive, as of the end of Executive's employment and Executive, at the Board's request, will execute any documents necessary to reflect his resignation.
Board Membership
          (c) . During the Employment Term, Executive, except as provided below, will devote Executive's full business efforts and time to the Company and will use good faith efforts to discharge Executive's obligations under this Agreement to the best of Executive's ability and in accordance with each of the Company's written corporate guidance and ethics guidelines, conflict of interests policies and code of conduct. For the duration of the Employment Term, Executive agrees not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation, or consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without the prior approval of the Board (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that Executive may, without the approval of the Board, (i) serve in any capacity with any civic, educational, professional, industry or charitable organization, provided such services do not interfere with Executive's obligations to Company, and (ii) serve on the board of directors of one (1) company of his choosing, with such company to be reasonably acceptable to the Board (currently Teridian Semiconductor Corporation, as to which Executive is paid by Golden Gate Capital and such service will not constitute a violation of this Section 1(c)).
Obligations
               (i) Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Executive is not party to any contract, understanding, agreement or policy, written or otherwise, that would be breached by Executive's entering into, or performing services under, this Agreement.
 
Executive further represents that he has disclosed to the Company in writing all threatened, pending, or actual claims that are unresolved and still outstanding as of the Effective Date, in each case, against Executive of which he is aware, if any, as a result of his employment with any previous employer or his membership on any boards of directors.
               (d) . Executive agrees to serve and will be appointed, without additional compensation, as an officer and director for each of the Company's subsidiaries, partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability companies and other affiliates, including entities in which the Company has a significant investment as determined by the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" will mean any entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control of the Company.
Other Entities
     2. . Executive and the Company agree that Executive's employment with the Company constitutes "at-will" employment. Executive and the Company acknowledge that this employment relationship may be terminated at any time, upon written notice to the other party, with or without good cause or for any or no cause, at the option either of the Company or Executive. However, as described in this Agreement, Executive may be entitled to severance benefits depending upon the circumstances of Executive's termination of employment.
At-Will Employment
     3. .
Compensation
          (a) . Commencing with the Effective Date, the Company will pay Executive an annual salary of $700,000 as compensation for his services (such annual salary, as is then effective, to be referred to herein as "Base Salary"). Executive's Base Salary will be subject to annual review (subject to the provisions of Section 10(e)(iii) of this Agreement). The Base Salary will be paid periodically in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices and will be subject to the usual, required withholdings.
Base Salary
          (b) . Executive will be eligible to receive annual cash incentives payable for the achievement of performance goals established by the Board or by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee"). During the Employment Term, Executive's target annual incentive ("Target Annual Incentive") will be not less than 100% of Base Salary. The actual earned annual cash incentive, if any, payable to Executive for any performance period will depend upon the extent to which the applicable performance goal(s) specified by the Committee with the input of Executive are achieved or exceeded and will be adjusted for under- or over-performance. Any incentive earned during the remainder of fiscal 2006 will be pro-rated based on Executive's hire date (calculated by multiplying any annual incentive earned by Executive by a fraction with a numerator equal to the number of days inclusive between the Effective Date and December 31, 2006 and a denominator equal to 365).
Annual Incentive
          (c) .
Equity Awards
               (i) As of August 7, 2006, Executive will be granted a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 1,450,000 shares of Company common stock at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq") for the common stock of the Company on August 7, 2006 (the "Initial Option"). The Initial Option will be granted under and subject to the terms, definitions and provisions of the Company's 2005 Stock Plan (the "Plan") and
 
will be scheduled to vest at a rate of 25% of the shares subject to the Initial Option on the first anniversary of the grant and 1/48 of the shares will be scheduled to vest monthly thereafter assuming Executive's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date. Except as provided in this Agreement, the Initial Option will be subject to the Company's standard terms and conditions for options granted under the Plan.
               (ii) The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to secure approval from Nasdaq for the grant of an additional option to purchase 2,550,000 shares of Company common stock at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the Nasdaq for the common stock of the Company on the date of grant (the "Stand-Alone Grant"). Subject to Nasdaq approval, the Stand-Alone Grant will be granted under a non-stockholder approved arrangement outside of any Company equity plan. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Stand-Alone Grant will be materially similar to those of the Initial Option (except that it will not be granted under a Company equity plan), and will be scheduled to vest at a rate of 25% of the shares subject to the award on August 7, 2007, and the remainder of the shares will be scheduled to vest pro-rata monthly over the three (3) year period commencing on August 7, 2007, assuming Executive's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date. Following the issue of the Stand-Alone Grant, the Company will use commercially reasonable best efforts to register the shares underlying the Stand-Alone Grant on Form S-8 in order to permit resale thereof.
               (iii) If the Company does not receive Nasdaq approval of the Stand-Alone Grant by December 31, 2006, then on January 2, 2007 (assuming Executive is still employed by the Company), the Company will grant to Executive a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 500,000 shares of Company common stock at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the Nasdaq for the common stock of the Company on January 2, 2007 (the "Additional Option"). The Additional Option will be granted under and subject to the same terms, definitions and provisions applicable to the Initial Option, and will be scheduled to vest at a rate of 25% of the shares subject to the award on August 7, 2007, and the remainder of the shares will be scheduled to vest pro-rata monthly over the three (3) year period commencing on August 7, 2007, assuming Executive's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date. In addition, if Nasdaq approval of the Stand-Alone Grant is not obtained, on January 2, 2007 (assuming Executive is still employed by the Company), the Company will grant 1,000,000 shares of restricted stock (or restricted stock units) to Executive under and subject to the same terms, definitions and provisions applicable to the Initial Option assuming exercise thereof, except that such shares will be scheduled to vest at a rate of 25% of the shares subject to the award vesting on August 7, 2007, and the remainder of the shares will be scheduled to vest pro-rata quarterly over the three (3) year period commencing on August 7, 2007, assuming Executive's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date. The Company agrees (to the extent permitted by the Company's Insider Trading Policy), at the request of Executive, to facilitate the implementation by Executive of a 10b5-1 trading plan to accommodate Executive's ability to sell such portion of the relevant shares as may be necessary to cover Executive's tax withholding obligations with respect to such vesting, if any, at such tax rate as Executive may specify. If the Company's Insider Trading Policy does not permit the implementation of a 10b5-1 trading plan, Executive will be allowed to have the Company withhold the number of shares necessary to satisfy his minimum tax withholding obligation.
 
     4. .
Employee Benefits
          (a) . Executive will be eligible to participate in accordance with the terms of all Company employee benefit plans, policies and arrangements that are applicable to other executive officers of the Company, as such plans, policies and arrangements may exist from time to time.

In the event Executive's employment with the Company terminates due to death or Disability, then there will be acceleration of vesting of any then unexpired and unvested equity awards (including, but not limited to, awards of stock appreciation rights or restricted stock units) held by Executive based on the vesting that Executive would have achieved had Executive remained in the employ of the Company for an additional twelve (12) months (provided that, if Executive's employment with the Company terminates due to death or Disability prior to January 2, 2007, then "twenty-four (24) months" will be substituted for "twelve (12) months" in this sentence). In addition, if the termination is by the Company without Cause or Executive resigns for Good Reason, Executive will be entitled to the amounts and benefits specified in Section 7.

Termination Without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason other than in Connection with a Change of Control
 
amounts to be paid out bi-weekly in accordance with the Company's normal payroll policies; (ii) the current year's Target Annual Incentive pro-rated to the date of termination, with such pro-rated amount to be calculated by multiplying the current year's Target Annual Incentive by a fraction with a numerator equal to the number of days inclusive between the start of the current calendar year and the date of termination and a denominator equal to 365, such amounts to be paid out bi-weekly in accordance with the Company's normal payroll policies over the course of twelve (12) months; (iii) twelve (12) months accelerated vesting with respect to Executive's then outstanding, unvested equity awards, and (iv) reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits for Executive (and any eligible dependents) under the Company's health plans until the earlier of (A) eighteen (18) months, payable when such premiums are due (provided Executive validly elects to continue coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA")), or (B) the date upon which Executive and Executive's eligible dependents become covered under similar plans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive is terminated without Cause or resigns for Good Reason, and such termination is not in Connection with a Change of Control and occurs prior to January 2, 2007, then "twenty-four (24) months" will be substituted for "twelve (12) months" in clause (iii) of the preceding sentence.
          (b) . If Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason, and the termination is in Connection with a Change of Control, then, subject to Section 8, Executive will receive: (i) continued payment of Executive's Base Salary for the year in which the termination occurs (subject to applicable tax withholdings), for twenty-four (24) months, such amounts to be paid out bi-weekly in accordance with the Company's normal payroll policies; (ii) the payment in an amount equal to 100% of Executive's Target Annual Incentive for the year in which the termination occurs (subject to applicable tax withholdings), such amounts to be paid out bi-weekly in accordance with the Company's normal payroll policies over the course of twelve (12) months; (iii) the current year's Target Annual Incentive pro-rated to the date of termination, with such pro-rated amount to be calculated by multiplying the current year's Target Annual Incentive by a fraction with a numerator equal to the number of days inclusive between the start of the current calendar year and the date of termination and a denominator equal to 365 such amounts to be paid out bi-weekly in accordance with the Company's normal payroll policies over the course of twelve (12) months; (iv) 100% (subject to the following sentence) of Executive's then outstanding unvested equity awards will vest, and (v) reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits for Executive (and any eligible dependents) under the Company's health plans until the earlier of (A) eighteen (18) months, payable when such premiums are due (provided Executive validly elects to continue coverage under COBRA), or (B) the date upon which Executive and Executive's eligible dependents become covered under similar plans. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the Change of Control occurs between January 2, 2007 and August 7, 2007 inclusive, only 50% of Executive's then outstanding unvested equity awards will vest.

     8. .
Conditions to Receipt of Severance; No Duty to Mitigate
          (a) . The receipt of any severance or other benefits pursuant to Section 7 will be subject to Executive signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. No severance or other benefits pursuant to Section 7 will be paid or provided until the separation agreement and release agreement becomes effective.
Separation Agreement and Release of Claims
          (b) . The receipt of any severance or other benefits pursuant to Section 7 will be subject to Executive agreeing that during the Employment Term and Continuance Period, Executive will not (i) solicit any employee of the Company (other than Executive's personal assistant) for employment other than at the Company, or (ii) directly or indirectly engage in, have any ownership interest in or participate in any entity that as of the date of termination, competes with the Company in any substantial business of the Company or any business reasonably expected to become a substantial business of the Company within the Continuance Period. If Executive violates this Section 8(b), the Company's sole form of recourse will be to terminate any future payments or benefits owed to Executive pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement. Executive's passive ownership of not more than 1% of any publicly traded company and/or 5% ownership of any privately held company will not constitute a breach of this Section 8(b). Public solicitation, such as by taking out ads in a newspaper, advertising on the web and the like, not specifically aimed at employees of the Company, will not constitute a breach of this Section 8(b).
Non-solicitation and Non-competition
          (c) . During the Employment Term and Continuance Period, Executive and the Company in its official communications will not knowingly and materially disparage, criticize, or otherwise make any derogatory statements regarding the other. The Company will instruct its officers and directors to not knowingly and materially disparage, criticize, or otherwise make any derogatory statements regarding Executive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this agreement will be deemed to restrict Executive, the Company or any of the Company's current or former officers and/or directors from providing factual information to any governmental or regulatory agency (or in any way limit the content of any such information) to the extent they are requested or required to provide such information pursuant to applicable law or regulation.
Nondisparagement
          (d) . Executive's receipt of continued severance payments pursuant to Section 7 will be subject to Executive continuing to comply with the terms of the Confidential Information Agreement and the provisions of this Section 8.
Other Requirements
          (e) . Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor will any earnings that Executive may receive from any other source reduce any such payment.
No Duty to Mitigate
     9. . In the event that the benefits provided for in this Agreement constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then Executive's severance benefits payable under the terms of this Agreement will be either (a) delivered in full, or (b) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such severance benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing
Excise Tax
 
amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless Executive and the Company agree otherwise in writing, the determination of Executive's Excise Tax liability, if any, and the amount, if any, required to be paid under this Section 9 will be made in writing by the independent auditors who are primarily used by the Company immediately prior to the Change of Control (the "Accountants"). For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 10, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Executive and the Company agree to furnish such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 9. The Company will bear all costs the Accountants may incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 9.

Cause

               (ii) Any act of personal dishonesty taken by Executive in connection with his responsibilities as an employee of the Company with the intention or reasonable expectation that such action may result in the substantial personal enrichment of Executive;

               (vii) Executive's disqualification or bar by any governmental or self-regulatory authority from serving in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement or Executive's loss of any governmental or self-regulatory license that is reasonably necessary for Executive to
 
perform his responsibilities to the Company under this Agreement, if (A) the disqualification, bar or loss continues for more than thirty (30) days, and (B) during that period the Company uses its good faith efforts to cause the disqualification or bar to be lifted or the license replaced. While any disqualification, bar or loss continues during Executive's employment, Executive will serve in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement to whatever extent legally permissible and, if Executive's employment is not permissible, Executive will be placed on leave (which will be paid to the extent legally permissible).

Change of Control
               (i) The consummation by the Company of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 50% of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation;
               (ii) The approval by the stockholders of the Company, or if stockholder approval is not required, approval by the Board, of a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets;

Disability
          (e) . For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" means the occurrence of any of the following, without Executive's express written consent:
Good Reason
 
               (i) An adverse change in Executive's title or reporting relationship, or a significant reduction of Executive's duties, position, or responsibilities, relative to Executive's duties, position, or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction;
               (ii) A material reduction in the kind or level of employee benefits to which Executive is entitled immediately prior to such reduction with the result that Executive's overall benefits package is significantly reduced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a one-time reduction that also is applied to substantially all other executive officers of the Company and that reduces the level of employee benefits by a percentage reduction of 10% or less will not constitute "Good Reason";
               (iii) A reduction in Executive's Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive as in effect immediately prior to such reduction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a one-time reduction that also is applied to substantially all other executive officers of the Company and which one-time reduction reduces the Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive by a percentage reduction of 10% or less in the aggregate will not constitute "Good Reason";

The failure of the Company's stockholders to elect or reelect Executive to the Board will not constitute "Good Reason" for purposes of this Agreement.

In Connection with a Change of Control
     11. . Subject to applicable law, Executive will be provided indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, including, if applicable, any directors and officers insurance policies, with such indemnification to be on terms determined by the Board or any of its committees, but on terms no less favorable than provided to any other Company executive officer or director and subject to the terms of any separate written indemnification agreement.
Indemnification
     12. . Executive will execute the form of Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, appended hereto as (the "Confidential Information Agreement").

For this purpose, "successor" means any person, firm, corporation, or other business entity which at any time, whether by purchase, merger, or otherwise, directly or indirectly acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company. None of the rights of Executive to receive any form of compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement may be assigned or transferred except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any other attempted assignment, transfer, conveyance, or other disposition of Executive's right to compensation or other benefits will be null and void. This Section 13 will in no way prevent Executive from transferring any vested property he owns.

Severability
     16. . The parties agree that any and all disputes arising out of the terms of this Agreement, Executive's employment by the Company, Executive's service as an officer or director of the Company, or Executive's compensation and benefits, their interpretation and any of the matters herein released, will be subject to binding arbitration. In the event of a dispute, the parties (or their legal representatives) will promptly confer to select a single Arbitrator mutually acceptable to both parties. If the parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then the moving party may file a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in Santa Clara County, California, who will be selected and appointed consistent with the AAA-Employment Dispute Resolution Rules.

Arbitration
 
Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes, supplemented by the California Rules of Civil Procedure. The Parties further agree that the prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award. This paragraph will not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) from any court having jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject matter of their dispute relating to Executive's obligations under this Agreement and the Confidential Information Agreement.
The parties hereby agree to waive their right to have any dispute between them resolved in a court of law by a judge or jury.
     17. . The Company will reimburse Executive up to $9,000 for reasonable and actual legal expenses incurred by him in connection with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the Confidential Information Agreement, and related matters.
Legal Expenses

Exhibit 10.2
March 13, 2007
Mr. Steven Laub c/o Atmel Corporation 2325 Orchard Parkway San Jose, CA 95131
     Re: Employment Agreement dated as of August 6, 2006 (the "Employment Agreement")
Dear Steve:
     As you know, Atmel Corporation (the "Company") was contractually required to issue to you 1,000,000 shares (the "Restricted Shares") of restricted stock (or restricted stock units) on January 2, 2007, but did not do so as a result of the Company not having a then current prospectus relating to the S-8 registration statement applicable to such an issuance. As a result, the Company and you agree as follows:
     1. You waive the right to assert that such failure to issue the Restricted Shares constitutes a material breach for purposes of Section 10(e)(v) of the Employment Agreement, conditioned on the Company's performance of the terms hereof.
     2. The Company will issue the Restricted Shares to you within ten (10) business days after the date the prospectus relating to the Company's S-8 registration statement again becomes current, but prior to August 6, 2007. Notwithstanding such delayed issuance, vesting of the Restricted Shares will be per the dates and schedule set forth in the Employment Agreement.
     3. If your employment with the Company terminates prior to the issuance of the Restricted Shares then you will receive vesting of the Initial Option and Additional Option as expressly set forth in the Employment Agreement. In addition, the Company will pay to you in cash an amount equal to the Vested Portion of the Restricted Shares multiplied by the Fair Value (the "Restricted Share Payment"). If the Restricted Share Payment is paid to you and such payment results in your being subject to a greater Excise Tax than you would have been subject to had the Restricted Shares instead been issued (and become vested) in accordance with the provisions of the Employment Agreement (such increase in the Excise Tax referred to as the "Increased Excise Tax"), then you will receive from the Company: (a) a cash payment sufficient to pay the Increased Excise Tax; and (b) additional cash payments sufficient to pay the federal and state income and employment taxes and additional Excise Taxes arising from the payments (including such additional cash payments) made to you by the Company. The "Vested Portion of the Restricted Shares" will mean the number of Restricted Shares that would have vested as expressly set forth in the Employment Agreement through and as a result of such
 
termination had the Restricted Shares been issued on January 2, 2007. "Fair Value" will mean (a) if the Company is then publicly traded, an amount equal to the closing price of a share of common stock of the Company averaged over the twenty (20) trading days immediately prior to the date of such termination; or (b) if the Company is not then publicly traded, an amount equal to the fair market value of a share of common stock of the Company as of the date of such termination as determined by mutual agreement of the parties. In the absence of such mutual agreement, such per share fair market value will be determined by arbitration pursuant to the Employment Agreement, provided that each party will submit to the arbitrator its determination of the fair market value of a share of common stock of the Company and the arbitrator will be constrained in its determination of the Company's per share fair market value to select one (1) of the two (2) figures so submitted, except that if the Company's proposed per share fair market value is greater than your proposed per share fair market value, the per share fair market value will equal the mid-point of the two (2) figures so submitted (the "Mid-Point"). Upon receipt of each party's proposed figure, the Company will make payment to you as provided above based on its proposed per share fair market value (or the Mid-Point, if applicable) as an advance against the amount to be paid to you as provided above based on the per share fair market value to be determined by the arbitrator.
     4. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings set forth in the Employment Agreement.
     5. Except as amended hereby, the Employment Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
     To acknowledge your agreement to the foregoing, please sign and return a copy of this letter, whereupon both the Company and you will be bound by the terms hereof.

Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year
On March 23, 2007, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Atmel Corporation ("Atmel") adopted amendments to Article III, Section 3.2 of Atmel's Bylaws (the "Bylaws") to change the number of directors from eight (8) to six (6), and to Article III, Section 3.3 of the Bylaws to provide for a majority voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections instead of the plurality voting standard previously in the Bylaws. Under the majority voting standard now set forth in the Bylaws, nominees for directors must receive more than 50% of the votes cast to be elected. Abstentions will not be included as votes cast.
The amended Bylaws require director nominees who do not receive a majority of the votes cast to promptly tender their resignation to the Board in accordance with an agreement that each nominee for election as a director is required to sign to be eligible for election or re-election as a director. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board (the "Committee") will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation or to take other action. The Board is required to act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Committee's recommendation, and to publicly disclose its decision and rationale within 90 days from the date of certification of the election results.
To the extent that one or more directors' resignations are accepted by the Board, or if a nominee who is not an incumbent director is not elected, then the Board in its discretion may determine either to fill such vacancy or vacancies or to reduce the size of the Board. In the case of a contested election, directors are elected by plurality vote.
The Bylaws, as amended and restated, are filed as Exhibit 3.1 hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

          (a) The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the board of directors. In the absence of such designation, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on the fourth Wednesday in April in each year at 2:00 p.m. However, if such day falls on a legal holiday, then the meeting shall be held at the same time and place on the next succeeding full business day. At the meeting, directors shall be elected, and any other proper business may be transacted.
          (b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.

For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the date specified in the corporation's proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy
 
statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made. A stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (v) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.

Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
     . A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors, by the chairman of the board, or by the president, but such special meetings may not be
2.3
Special Meeting
 
called by any other person or persons. Only such business shall be considered at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been stated in the notice for such meeting.
     . All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these Bylaws not less than ten (10) (or, if sent by third-class mail pursuant to Section 2.5 of these Bylaws, thirty (30)) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall specify the place, date and hour of the meeting and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election.
2.4
Notice Of Stockholders' Meetings
     . Written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given either (i) personally, (ii) by private courier, (iii) by first- or third-class United States mail, (iv) by telegraphic communication, (v) by other written communication or (vi) by other electronic or wireless means. Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or by courier or deposited in the mail or sent by telegram or other means of written communication or other electronic or wireless means.
2.5
Manner Of Giving Notice; Affidavit Of Notice
     An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
     . The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance with Section 2.7 of these Bylaws.
2.6
Quorum
     When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
     If a quorum be initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.
     . When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the
2.7
Adjourned Meeting; Notice
 
corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
     . The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these Bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
2.8
Voting
     Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     . The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
2.9
Validation Of Meetings; Waiver Of Notice; Consent
     Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
     . Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock or any other class of stock or series thereof having a preference over the Common Stock as dividend or upon liquidation, the stockholders of the corporation may not take action by written consent without a meeting but must take any such actions at a duly called annual or special meeting.
2.10
No Stockholder Action By Written Consent
     . For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, by these Bylaws, by agreement or by applicable law.
2.11
Record Date For Stockholder Notice; Voting
     If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
     A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the
 
adjourned meeting, but the board of directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.
     The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws.
     . Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, telefacsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to the irrevocability of proxies).
2.12
Proxies
     . The president, or in the absence of the president, the chairman of the board, shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order, and shall act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the president, the chairman of the board, and all of the vice presidents, the stockholders shall appoint a chairman for such meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business. The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the stockholders, but in the absence of the secretary at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
2.13
Organization
     . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
2.14
List Of Stockholders Entitled To Vote
     . Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
2.15
Inspectors Of Election
 
          Such inspectors shall:
          (a) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
          (b) receive votes, ballots or consents;
          (c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
          (d) count and tabulate all votes or consents;
          (e) determine when the polls shall close;
          (f) determine the result; and
          (g) do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
     . Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and to any limitations in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
3.1
Powers

3.2
Number Of Directors
     .
3.3
Election And Term Of Office Of Directors
          (a) Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these Bylaws, at each annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the corporation shall be elected to hold office until the expiration of the term for which they are elected, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified; except that if any such election shall not be so held, such election shall take place at a stockholders' meeting called and held in accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware. The term of office of a director shall begin immediately after election. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed.
          (b) Each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes of this bylaw, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast
 
shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
          (c) If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the board of directors in accordance with the agreement to be executed by each such nominee as a condition of such nomination. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall make a recommendation to the board of directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board of directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in making its recommendation, and the board of directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the decision of the board of directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the board of directors, such director shall continue to serve until the end of his or her term and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the board of directors pursuant to this bylaw, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 or may decrease the size of the board of directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2.
     . Any director may resign effective on giving written notice to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective. Each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
3.4

Each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced and until a successor has been elected and qualified.

               (iii) If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to meetings of stockholders).
     If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10%) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to meetings of stockholders) as far as applicable.

     Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; and, if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
     Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
 
     The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
     .

8.5
Special Designation On Certificates
     . Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
8.6
Lost Certificates
     . The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
8.7

     . Any reference in these Bylaws to the time a notice is given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless means, to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient.

Amendment of Certain Option Agreements
On April 6, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") approved an amendment (collectively the "Amendments") to certain stock option agreements (the "Applicable Option Agreements") issued pursuant to the Company's 1996 Stock Plan that were scheduled to expire beginning April 2007. As previously disclosed, while the Company is not current in its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "SEC Blackout"), the Company has suspended the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock upon exercise of stock options pursuant to its registration statements on Form S-8 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Applicable Option Agreements, which may not be exercised during the SEC Blackout, would otherwise expire during the SEC Blackout. The Amendments provide that the term of the Applicable Option Agreements shall be extended such that such agreements will expire upon the later of (i) the expiration of the original exercise period, or (ii) 30 days after the earliest date upon which the option may be exercised without violating applicable securities laws. Bernard Pruniaux and Steve Schumann, who are executive officers of the Company, hold Applicable Option Agreements that have been amended as described above.
 
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 8.01. Other Events
On April 30, 2007, Atmel Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release discussing the findings of the Audit Committee's investigation into the Company's historical stock option practices. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
Table of Contents

 
SAN JOSE, CA, April 30, 2007  Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced that the Audit Committee of Atmel's Board of Directors has substantially completed its independent investigation regarding the timing of the Company's past stock option grants and practices relating to such grants.
As previously announced, in early July 2006 the Company began a voluntary internal review of historical stock option granting practices. On July 25, 2006, the Company announced that the Audit Committee had initiated an independent investigation, with the assistance of independent counsel and independent forensic accountants, regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. On October 30, 2006, the Company announced that financial statements for all prior periods should no longer be relied upon. As previously disclosed, the Company received an informal request for information from the San Francisco District Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") relating to the Company's past granting of stock options. The Company is cooperating fully with the SEC in all matters related to this request.
Results of Audit Committee Investigation
The Audit Committee's investigation covered 112 stock option grants, consisting of over 10,000 individual stock option grants to approximately 4,250 recipients, for all grant dates during the period January 1, 1997 through August 3, 2006. The Audit Committee extended the scope of the original review by having the Company conduct an analysis of approximately 90 additional stock option grants that were made during the period March 19, 1991 (the date of the Company's initial public offering) through December 31, 1996.
In connection with the investigation, more than 1,000,000 pages of hard copy documents and over 600,000 electronic documents were analyzed, and 63 current and former directors,
 
officers, and employees were interviewed. Based on the investigation, the Audit Committee concluded that:
The Audit Committee also found that after January 2004 the Company improved its stock option granting processes, and since that time, has generally granted stock options in accordance with the Company's stock option plans and approval procedures. The Company did not identify any material stock-based compensation adjustments that were required for periods after January 2004.
"We appreciate the diligent efforts of the Audit Committee and the thoroughness of its review" said Steven Laub, Atmel's President and CEO. "Our new leadership team is committed to ensuring that the highest standards of ethics and business conduct are followed."
 
Evaluation of the Conduct of Management and the Board of Directors:
The Audit Committee considered the involvement of former and current members of management and the Board of Directors in the stock option grant process and concluded that:
 
 
As a result of the measurement date errors identified in the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company has determined that material stock-based compensation adjustments are required for the period beginning in 1993 and continuing through January 2004. The Company estimates that aggregate non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for the period from 1993 through 2005, excluding related income tax adjustments, will be approximately $125 million. Any such compensation expenses would have the effect of decreasing net income or increasing net loss and decreasing retained earnings or increasing accumulated deficit as reported in the Company's historical financial statements.
The financial information in this release is preliminary and is subject to changes that might result from management's review of the findings of the Audit Committee, and audit by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, but it provides management's best estimates based on available information.

Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements
The independent investigation has had and may in the future have an impact on the Company's ability to file required reports with the SEC on a timely basis; its ability to meet the requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market for continued listing of its shares; potential claims and proceedings relating to such matters, including shareholder or employee litigation and action by the SEC and/or other governmental agencies; and negative tax or other implications for the Company resulting from accounting adjustments or other factors.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced unaudited selected financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007. All references to revenues exclude those provided by the Company's former Grenoble subsidiary, which was sold in July 2006.
SAN JOSE, CA, May 1, 2007
First quarter 2007 revenues totaled $391.3 million, a 2% decrease compared to the $400.8 million reported in the first quarter of 2006, excluding Grenoble, and a decrease of 4% compared to the $408.9 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2006.
The Company's cash position, net of debt, grew by $34.5 million during the first quarter of 2007. The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to $478.7 million at March 31, 2007, from $466.8 million at December 31, 2006, while long term debt (current and long term portions) decreased to $146.4 million at March 31, 2007, from $169.0 million at December 31, 2006.
First Quarter 2007 and Recent Highlights
"Our revenues for the first quarter achieved the high end of our guidance as business continued to strengthen throughout the period, especially for our proprietary products. Sales of our microcontroller products grew by 9% sequentially and approximately 19% compared to the first quarter of 2006.
 
Particularly noteworthy is that our proprietary AVR microcontroller products grew a remarkable 17% sequentially," stated Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "As we enter the second quarter, we are very pleased to report that we anticipate sequential revenue growth due to continued strength of our proprietary products."
Mr. Laub added, "We are on-track in the implementation of the restructuring and cost-savings initiatives that we announced in December, and we anticipate announcing and implementing additional strategic initiatives throughout 2007 as we position Atmel for sustainable and profitable growth."
Outlook
The Company anticipates second quarter 2007 revenues will be up 1% to 4% on a sequential basis.
Stock Option Investigation
As previously announced, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has substantially completed its independent investigation regarding the timing of the Company's past stock option grants and practices relating to such grants. As a result of the measurement date errors identified in the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company has determined that material stock-based compensation adjustments are required for measurement date errors in the period beginning in 1993 and continuing through January 2004. The Company estimates that aggregate non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for the period from 1993 through 2005, excluding related income tax adjustments, will be approximately $125 million. Any such compensation expenses would have the effect of decreasing net income or increasing net loss and decreasing retained earnings or increasing accumulated deficit as reported in the Company's historical financial statements.
The financial information in this release was compiled by the management of Atmel Corporation and has not been audited or reviewed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The financial information is preliminary and subject to potentially material adjustment depending on the ultimate outcome upon completion of the Company's independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues. Any reliance placed on this unaudited and unreviewed financial information is to be done with the full understanding and acceptance of the foregoing uncertainties. As a result of the continuing investigation, the Company does not believe it will file its Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007 by the due date of May 10, 2007 and is unable to provide additional financial information for the first quarter of 2007 at this time.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing
On May 10, 2007, Atmel Corporation (the "Company" or "Atmel") filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that it would not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2007. As expected, on May 14, 2007, Atmel received a notice of non-compliance from the Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market, in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), due to the delay in the filing of the Form 10-Q.
Also on May 10, 2007, the Company received the decision of the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council (the "Listing Council") in response to the Company's request for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Specifically, the Listing Council granted the Company's request for an extension within which to satisfy NASDAQ's filing requirement, through June 8, 2007.
As previously announced, Atmel received notices of non-compliance from NASDAQ on August 14, 2006 and November 14, 2006 due to delays in the filing of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, respectively (together with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2007, the "Forms 10-Q") and on March 8, 2007 due to the delay in filing the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 (the "Form 10-K"). The Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K filing delays are attributable to the fact that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has been conducting an independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues.
As previously disclosed, in response to the first notice of non-compliance, Atmel requested a hearing before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel"). Following the hearing, the Panel granted the Company's request for continued listing subject to the requirements that Atmel provide the Panel with certain information relating to the Audit Committee's investigation, which was subsequently submitted to the Panel, and that the Company file the Forms 10-Q and any necessary restatements by February 9, 2007.
On January 22, 2007, the Listing Council determined to call the Company's matter for review. The Listing Council also determined to stay the Panel decision that required the Company to file the Forms 10-Q by February 9, 2007. In connection with the call for review, the Listing Council requested that the Company provide an update on its efforts to file the delayed reports, which it did on March 2, 2007.
As disclosed in the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 1, 2007, the Audit Committee has substantially completed its independent investigation. As a result of the measurement date errors identified during the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company has determined that material stock-based compensation adjustments are required for measurement date errors in the period beginning in 1993 and continuing through January 2004. The Company estimates that aggregate non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for the period from 1993 through 2005, excluding related income tax adjustments, will be approximately $125 million. Any such compensation expenses would have the effect of decreasing net income or increasing net loss and decreasing retained earnings or increasing accumulated deficit as reported in the Company's historical financial statements.
The Audit Committee is making every effort to finalize its investigation and the Company is working diligently to complete all necessary filings and thereby demonstrate compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market prior to the Listing Council's deadline of June 8, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . On May 10, 2007, Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that it would not timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2007. As expected, on May 14, 2007, Atmel received a notice of non-compliance from the Staff of The NASDAQ Stock Market, in accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14), due to the delay in the filing of the Form 10-Q.
SAN JOSE, CA, May 18, 2007
Also on May 10, 2007, the Company received the decision of the NASDAQ Listing and Hearing Review Council (the "Listing Council") in response to the Company's request for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Specifically, the Listing Council granted the Company's request for an extension within which to satisfy NASDAQ's filing requirement, through June 8, 2007.
As previously announced, Atmel received notices of non-compliance from NASDAQ on August 14, 2006 and November 14, 2006 due to delays in the filing of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2006 and September 30, 2006, respectively (together with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2007, the "Forms 10-Q") and on March 8, 2007 due to the delay in filing the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 (the "Form 10-K"). The Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K filing delays are attributable to the fact that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has been conducting an independent investigation regarding the timing of past stock option grants and other potentially related issues.
As previously disclosed, in response to the first notice of non-compliance, Atmel requested a hearing before a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel (the "Panel"). Following the hearing, the Panel granted the Company's request for continued listing subject to the requirements that Atmel provide the Panel with certain information relating to the Audit Committee's investigation, which was subsequently submitted to the Panel, and that the Company file the Forms 10-Q and any necessary restatements by February 9, 2007.
 
On January 22, 2007, the Listing Council determined to call the Company's matter for review. The Listing Council also determined to stay the Panel decision that required the Company to file the Forms 10-Q by February 9, 2007. In connection with the call for review, the Listing Council requested that the Company provide an update on its efforts to file the delayed reports, which it did on March 2, 2007.
As disclosed in the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 1, 2007, the Audit Committee has substantially completed its independent investigation. As a result of the measurement date errors identified during the Audit Committee's investigation, the Company has determined that material stock-based compensation adjustments are required for measurement date errors in the period beginning in 1993 and continuing through January 2004. The Company estimates that aggregate non-cash stock-based compensation expenses for the period from 1993 through 2005, excluding related income tax adjustments, will be approximately $125 million. Any such compensation expenses would have the effect of decreasing net income or increasing net loss and decreasing retained earnings or increasing accumulated deficit as reported in the Company's historical financial statements.
The Audit Committee is making every effort to finalize its investigation and the Company is working diligently to complete all necessary filings and thereby demonstrate compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market prior to the Listing Council's deadline of June 8, 2007. The Company anticipates filing the Forms 10-Q and the Form 10-K as soon as practicable.
Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements
This release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding the description, amount and timing of pre-tax, non-cash stock-based compensation charges, the effects of the charges on the Company's past financial statements, the filing of the Company's delayed and restated SEC reports and other statements of expectation and belief. All forward-looking statements included in this release are based upon information available to Atmel as of the date of this release, which may change, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statement. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results could differ materially from our current expectations. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include the discovery of additional information relevant to the independent investigation, any additional conclusions of the Audit Committee (and the timing of such conclusions) concerning matters relating to the Company's stock option grants and the impact of the independent investigation on the amount
 
and timing of previously recorded stock-based compensation and the impact of other potentially related issues, the timing of review and conclusions of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm regarding the Company's stock option grants and related accounting, accounting adjustments to the Company's financial statements for certain periods, the application of accounting or tax principles in an unanticipated manner, an unanticipated delay in the preparation and filing of the Company's required reports with the SEC or an inability to meet the requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market for continued listing of the Company's shares, and other risks detailed from time to time in Atmel's SEC reports and filings, including our Form 10-K, filed on March 16, 2006 and subsequent Form 10-Q report for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, filed on May 10, 2006.
The independent investigation has had and may in the future have an impact on the Company's ability to file required reports with the SEC on a timely basis; its ability to meet the requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market for continued listing of its shares; potential claims and proceedings relating to such matters, including shareholder or employee litigation and action by the SEC and/or other governmental agencies; and negative tax or other implications for the Company resulting from accounting adjustments or other factors.

Determination of Cash Bonuses for Fiscal Year 2006
On June 18, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") approved cash bonus awards for the Company's executive officers pursuant to the Company's Executive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan") for fiscal year 2006. Other compensation for fiscal year 2006 was previously reported in the Summary Compensation Table beginning on page 17 of the definitive proxy statement for the Special Meeting of Stockholders held on May 18, 2007, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 11, 2007 (the "Proxy Statement"). Because the Company had not issued its audited financial statements for fiscal year 2006 at the time the Proxy Statement was filed, cash bonuses for executive officers under the Bonus Plan had not yet been determined and were not included in the Proxy Statement. Pursuant to Item 5.02(f) of Form 8-K, the cash bonus awards for the named executive officers for fiscal year 2006 are set forth below. An updated Summary Compensation Table reflecting the cash bonus awards is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On June 27, 2007, Atmel Corporation issued a press release discussing its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced its full results for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the same period. With this filing and those previously filed on June 8, 2007, the Company is now current with its SEC filings and expects to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements. As previously announced, the Company's filings were delayed as a result of the independent investigation relating to its past granting of stock options.
SAN JOSE, CA, June 27, 2007
Revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007 were $391.3 million, a 2% decrease compared to the $400.8 million (as restated) for the first quarter of 2006 and a decrease of 4% from the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006, as previously reported. During the first quarter of 2007, a tax benefit of $20 million was recognized from the receipt of French research and development tax credits related to prior tax years which resulted in a net tax benefit of $15 million for the quarter. As a result, net income for the first quarter of 2007 totaled $28.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $4.7 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2006 (as restated) and a net loss of $122.6 million or $0.25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2006 including asset impairment, restructuring and other charges of $121.2 million.
"We are pleased to have completed the remaining filings required to become current with the SEC and anticipate regaining NASDAQ compliance shortly," stated Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are also encouraged that the restructuring initiatives announced in December 2006 are beginning to have a meaningful impact on our financial performance, as indicated by our first quarter results."

Assuming continued service on Atmel's Board, such options vest and become exercisable over four years, with 12.5% of the shares vesting six months after grant date and 2.0833% of the shares vesting each month thereafter until fully vested.
On July 26, 2007, the Company issued a press release about the new directors. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Atmel Corporation (the "Company") is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 8-K/A to amend the Company's Form 8-K, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 31, 2007 (the "Original Filing"), to disclose the subsequent appointment of Papken Der Torossian to the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and Jack L. Saltich to the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. The initial appointment of Messrs. Der Torossian and Saltich to the Company's Board of Directors was disclosed in the Original Filing. At the time of the Original Filing, the Company's Board of Directors had not determined to which committees, if any, Messrs. Der Torossian and Saltich would be appointed. The disclosure under Item 5.02 of the Original Filing is hereby replaced in its entirety by the disclosure under Item 5.02 of this Amendment No. 1.
Election of Directors
At the annual meeting of stockholders of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") held on July 25, 2007, stockholders elected two new directors:
In connection with their election to the Board, the Company also granted each of Mr. Der Torossian and Mr. Saltich a non-qualified stock option for the purchase of 50,000 shares of Atmel's common stock at an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value on that date, or $5.69 per share. Assuming continued service on Atmel's Board, such options vest and become exercisable over four years, with 12.5% of the shares vesting six months after grant date and 2.0833% of the shares vesting each month thereafter until fully vested.
On August 17, 2007 the Company's Board of Directors appointed Mr. Der Torossian to the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and appointed Mr. Saltich to the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee, and Pierre Fougere stepped down from the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Accordingly, the current committee membership of the Company's Board of Directors is as follows:
 
On July 26, 2007, the Company issued a press release about the new directors. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Amendment of 2005 Stock Plan
At the Company's annual meeting of stockholders held on July 25, 2007, stockholders also approved an amendment to the Company's 2005 Stock Plan. The amendment to the 2005 Plan permits the Company to commence a "409A exchange offer" in connection with every option that was unvested, in whole or in part, as of December 31, 2004 and that had a per share exercise price that was less than the fair market value per share of the Company's common stock, as determined for purposes of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, on its grant date. The amendment is attached hereto in its entirety as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the terms of the transactions, the Company will purchase up to $125 million of its common stock from each dealer. The number of shares actually purchased will be determined based on the volume weighted average share price of the Company's common stock during a specified period of time, subject to certain provisions that establish a minimum and maximum number of shares that may be repurchased by the Company. The dealers will deliver the minimum number of shares to the Company shortly after determination of such minimum and maximum number of shares. The Company may receive additional shares from each dealer depending on the average price of the Company's common stock over a period of time following delivery of the minimum number of shares, subject to a maximum number of shares.
The Company will prepay $125 million to each dealer shortly after execution. In certain circumstances the completion dates of the transactions may be shortened or extended from the periods described above.
Shares repurchased under the transactions will be retired.
The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Form of Collared Accelerated Share Repurchase Confirmation (a "Confirmation") for the transactions, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Confirmation contains other terms governing the transactions, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the transactions, the settlement method, the circumstances under which the dealers are permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, circumstances under which the transactions may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by the Company and the dealers, including intended compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and intended compliance with the Rule 10b-18 volume and timing guidelines.

In addition, if any Averaging Date is a Disrupted Day, the Calculation Agent shall determine whether (i) such Averaging Date is a Disrupted Day in whole, in which case the VWAP Price for such Disrupted Day shall not be included for purposes of determining the Relevant Price or the Settlement Price or (ii) such Averaging Date is a Disrupted Day only in part, in which case the VWAP Price for such Disrupted Day shall be determined by the Calculation Agent based on the Rule 10b-18 dollar volume weighted average price per Share on the Exchange for such Averaging Date based on transactions executed before the relevant Market Disruption Event (if any) occurred and/or after the relevant Market Disruption Event (if any) ended, and the Relevant Price and Settlement Price shall be determined by the Calculation Agent using an appropriately weighted average of the VWAP Prices for all Averaging Dates instead of an arithmetic average.

Original Delivery Date
     (d) . Dealer acknowledges and agrees that this Confirmation is not intended to convey to it rights with respect to the Transaction that are senior to the claims of common stockholders in the event of Counterparty's bankruptcy.

Dealer may transfer or assign without Counterparty's consent its rights and obligations hereunder and under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to (i) any of its affiliates or (ii) any third party, in the case of clause (ii), with a rating for its long term, unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of AA or better by Standard and Poor's Rating Group, Inc. or its successor ("S&P"), or Aa2 or better by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or, if either S&P or Moody's ceases to rate such debt, at least an equivalent rating or better by a substitute agency rating mutually agreed by Counterparty and Dealer.
Transfer and Assignment
     (f) . Effective from the date of commencement of discussions concerning the Transaction, Counterparty and each of its employees, representatives, or other agents may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the Transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to Counterparty relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.
Tax Disclosure
     (g) . Notwithstanding any other provision in this Confirmation or the Supplemental Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing Dealer to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any Shares or other securities to or from Counterparty, Dealer may designate any of its affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such Shares or other securities and otherwise to perform Dealer's obligations in respect of the Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations. Dealer shall be discharged of its obligations to Counterparty to the extent of any such performance.
Designation by Dealer
     (h) . (i) If on any date cash would otherwise be payable or Shares or other property would otherwise be deliverable hereunder or pursuant to the Agreement and cash would otherwise be payable or Shares or other property would otherwise be deliverable hereunder or pursuant to the Agreement and the type of property required to be paid or delivered by each such party on such date is the same, then, on such date, each such party's obligation to make such payment or delivery will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable or deliverable by one such party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable or deliverable by the other such party, replaced by an obligation of the party by whom the larger aggregate amount would have been payable or deliverable to pay or deliver to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.
Netting and Set-off
     (ii) In addition to and without limiting any rights of set-off that a party hereto may have as a matter of law, pursuant to contract or otherwise, upon the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, Dealer shall have the right to terminate, liquidate and otherwise close out the Transaction and to set off any obligation or right that Dealer or any affiliate of Dealer may have to or against Counterparty hereunder or under the Agreement against any right or obligation Dealer or any of its affiliates may have against or to Counterparty hereunder or under the Agreement, including without limitation any right to receive a payment or delivery pursuant to any provision of the Agreement or hereunder. In the case of a set-off of any obligation to release, deliver or pay assets against any right to receive assets of the same type, such obligation and right shall be set off in kind. In the case of a set-off of any obligation to release, deliver or pay assets against any right to receive assets of any other type, the value of each of such obligation and such right shall be determined by the Calculation Agent and the result of such set-off shall be that the net obligor shall pay or deliver to the other party an amount of cash or assets, at Counterparty's option, with a value (determined, in the case of a delivery of assets, by the Calculation Agent) equal to that of the net obligation. In determining the value of any obligation to release or deliver Shares or any right to receive Shares, the value at any time of such obligation or right shall be determined by reference to the market value of the Shares at such time, as determined by the Calculation Agent. If an obligation or right is unascertained at the time of any such set-off, the Calculation Agent may in good faith estimate the amount or value of such obligation or right, in which case set-off will be effected in respect of that estimate, and the relevant party shall account to the other party at the time such obligation or right is ascertained.
 
     (iii) Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement (including without limitation Section 6(f) thereof), this Confirmation and the Supplemental Confirmation (including without limitation this Section 8(h)) or any other agreement between the parties to the contrary, (A) Counterparty shall not net or set off its obligations under the Transaction against its rights against Dealer under any other transaction or instrument; (B) Dealer may net and set off any rights of Dealer against Counterparty arising under the Transaction only against obligations of Dealer to Counterparty arising hereunder, under the Supplemental Confirmation or under the Agreement if the Agreement, this Confirmation and the Supplemental Confirmation do not convey rights to Dealer senior to the claims of common stockholders in the event of Counterparty's bankruptcy; and (C) in the event of Counterparty's bankruptcy, Dealer waives any and all rights it may have to set-off in respect of the Transaction, whether arising under agreement, applicable law or otherwise. Dealer will give notice to Counterparty of any netting or set off effected under this provision.
     (i) . Counterparty shall deliver to Dealer an opinion of counsel, dated as of the date hereof and reasonably acceptable to Dealer in form and substance, with respect to the due incorporation, existence and good standing of the Counterparty in Delaware, its qualification as a foreign corporation and good standing in California, the due authorization, execution and delivery of the Confirmation, and the absence of conflict of the execution and delivery of the Confirmation with any material agreement required filed as any exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Counterparty's charter documents.

Fiscal 2007 Executive Bonus Plan
On August 27, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") adopted an executive bonus plan for fiscal year 2007. The executive bonus plan is a cash incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the Company's financial and other performance objectives, and to reward them for their achievements when those objectives are met. All of the Company's executive officers pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as other officers reporting to the Company's CEO, are eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan. Target bonuses range from 50% to 110% of a participant's base salary, and the amount of the target bonus actually paid to a participant will be based on the achievement of (i) certain Company performance objectives related to the Company's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit as compared to the Company's annual operating plan approved in February 2007, (ii) certain individual performance objectives approved by the Compensation Committee, and (iii) for some participants, certain business unit objectives tied to the business unit's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit, or certain objectives tied to sales region billings. Achievements of each such factor will be measured independently, and a threshold for each factor must be met for any credit to be given to that factor. Awards will be prorated between threshold and target performance and target and stretch performance. The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2007, if any, will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce or increase the bonus that would otherwise be payable based on actual performance. However, no bonuses will be paid under the executive bonus plan if the Company does not achieve an annual non-GAAP operating profit (excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairment changes, and certain legal and accounting expenses). The aggregate maximum amount of bonuses payable under the executive bonus plan to the Company's executive officers pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is approximately $4.0 million.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Sale of Manufacturing Facility and Related Equipment in North Tyneside, U.K.
On October 8, 2007, Atmel North Tyneside Limited, incorporated under the laws of England and Wales ("Atmel North Tyneside"), together with Atmel Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Atmel"), entered into agreements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, incorporated in Taiwan ("TSMC") and Highbridge Business Park Limited, incorporated under the laws of England and Wales ("Highbridge Business Park") and Highbridge Properties Plc, incorporated under the laws of England and Wales ("Highbridge Properties") for the sale of Atmel's eight-inch wafer fabrication equipment and real property located in North Tyneside, United Kingdom (the "Transaction") as part of Atmel's strategic restructuring initiative undertaken in order to enhance profitability, accelerate Atmel's growth and reduce costs, which was previously announced on Atmel's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on December 13, 2006 (the "Previous Form 8-K"). A brief description of the material terms in certain agreements related to this Transaction is set forth below.
Property Purchase Agreement
In connection with this Transaction, Atmel North Tyneside and Atmel entered into an Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Property (the "Property Purchase Agreement") with Highbridge Business Park and Highbridge Properties. Pursuant to the Property Purchase Agreement, Highbridge Business Park agreed to pay 21 million, exclusive of VAT, for the North Tyneside property currently occupied by Atmel North Tyneside, subject to certain closing conditions, including the Tri-Partite Agreement (defined and discussed below) becoming unconditional prior to January 10, 2008. Highbridge Business Park is also acquiring ownership of two subsidiaries of Atmel North Tyneside, which were organized for the purpose of maintaining enterprise zone status for the property.
The Property Purchase Agreement further provides that Atmel North Tyneside shall indemnify Highbridge Business Park, and Highbridge Business Park shall indemnify Atmel North Tyneside, against certain losses incurred in connection with the Transaction, and that Atmel will guarantee Atmel North Tyneside's obligations under the Property Purchase Agreement. Following transfer of the North Tyneside property, Highbridge Business Park will lease the property back to Atmel North Tyneside for a period of time up to and including May 31, 2008.
Asset Purchase Agreement
Atmel North Tyneside and Atmel also entered into an Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of Certain Assets (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") with TSMC. Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, TSMC agreed to pay up to $82 million for specified eight-inch wafer fabrication equipment subject to the Tri-Partite Agreement (defined and discussed below) becoming unconditional. TSMC shall deposit the $82 million aggregate purchase price into an escrow account, which will be released to Atmel North Tyneside at the end of each month after the Tri-Partite Agreement becomes unconditional, according to the value of the equipment that was transferred to TSMC during the preceding month.
Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Atmel North Tyneside may continue to use the equipment being purchased until December 31, 2007 or later as necessary. The equipment shall be transferred from the North Tyneside site to TSMC beginning no later than January 1, 2008 and ending May 31, 2008 or later as necessary. The purchase price will be adjusted downward for any equipment that fails the testing and acceptance procedures specified in the Asset Purchase Agreement and that TSMC ultimately rejects or accepts at a reduced price. The Asset Purchase Agreement further provides that Atmel North Tyneside shall indemnify TSMC, and TSMC shall indemnify Atmel North Tyneside, against certain losses incurred in connection with the Transaction, and that Atmel will guarantee Atmel North Tyneside's obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
Table of Contents
Tri-Partite Agreement
Additionally, Atmel North Tyneside and Atmel entered into an Agreement in Relation to the Removal of Equipment (the "Tri-Partite Agreement") with TSMC, Highbridge Business Park and Highbridge Properties. The Tri-Partite Agreement regulates the removal of equipment from the North Tyneside property and governs indemnification between and among the parties during the period of equipment shutdown and removal and site clean-up following the closing of the sale of the North Tyneside property. The Tri-Partite Agreement becomes unconditional upon Atmel North Tyneside having complied with its statutory obligations to inform and consult with appropriate representatives of Atmel North Tyneside's employees in relation to the impact that the Transaction may have on those employees.
Subject to the terms of the Tri-Partite Agreement, Atmel North Tyneside agrees to indemnify Highbridge Business Park against losses resulting from certain adverse changes to the environmental condition of the property caused by equipment shutdown and removal from the North Tyneside property, and TSMC agrees to indemnify Atmel North Tyneside against losses caused by release or spill of hazardous materials caused by TSMC in connection with TSMC's removal of equipment from the North Tyneside property. Highbridge Business Park shall indemnify Atmel North Tyneside against losses Atmel North Tyneside sustains as a result of environmental liabilities created after Atmel North Tyneside and TSMC complete shutdown and removal of the equipment. Atmel North Tyneside also agrees to indemnify Highbridge Business Park and TSMC against certain losses resulting from specified employment claims made by employees or former employees of Atmel North Tyneside. Atmel agrees to guarantee Atmel North Tyneside's obligations under the Tri-Partite Agreement and Highbridge Properties agrees to guarantee Highbridge Business Park's obligations under the Tri-Partite Agreement.
On October 8, 2007, Atmel issued a press release regarding the Transaction; such press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.05. Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
As previously disclosed, Atmel recorded a net impairment charge of $72.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2006 after it announced its decision to sell its wafer fabrication facilities in North Tyneside. The charge related to the write-down of long lived assets of the North Tyneside site to their then-estimated fair values, less costs to dispose of the assets. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, , a gain shall be recognized for any subsequent increase in fair value less cost to sell, but not in excess of the cumulative loss previously recognized for assets that are classified as held for sale. Atmel expects to record a benefit of up to $40 million related to the recovery of fair value less costs to sell for the assets as a result of the equipment and property offers received.
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
As previously disclosed, Atmel also recorded restructuring charges of approximately $8.6 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2006 in connection with the restructuring initiatives announced in the Previous Form 8-K. As a result of the Transaction, Atmel expects to incur additional restructuring charges of up to $50.0 million related to the Transaction to be paid primarily in cash. These restructuring charges will be used to pay for obligations related to employee severance, contract terminations and other associated costs. Atmel is unable as of the date hereof to make a good faith determination of the estimates of amounts related to each such category, but will disclose such amounts when determined.
Item 2.06. Material Impairments
The information contained in Item 2.05 regarding the impairment charge is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced that it has entered into separate agreements with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd.) and Highbridge Business Park Limited for the sale of its eight-inch wafer fabrication equipment and related property located in North Tyneside, United Kingdom. The sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including a comprehensive consultation exercise with employees in accordance with best United Kingdom employment relations practice. Atmel had previously announced its intention to sell this facility as part of its strategic restructuring initiatives to reduce costs, accelerate growth and enhance profitability.
San Jose, CA, October 8, 2007
"The sale of our North Tyneside facility is a major step forward in transitioning Atmel to a fab-lite manufacturing model, which will improve our cost structure and increase shareholder value," said Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are making measurable progress in enhancing Atmel's competitive position as we implement our strategic restructuring initiatives and optimize our manufacturing capacity to improve Atmel's financial strength."
Mr. Laub continued, "Atmel has many hard working, dedicated employees, who serve our customers and our company admirably. We are committed to treating employees with respect and helping ease the transition for employees at the North Tyneside facility as production is concluded."
To ensure a seamless transition for its customers, Atmel will continue to manufacture products at the North Tyneside facility into the first quarter of 2008, during which time production will be redeployed to the Company's manufacturing operations in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Rousset, France as well as to external foundries.
Under the terms of the agreements, TSMC has agreed to purchase Atmel's eight-inch wafer fabrication equipment, and Highbridge Business Park Limited has agreed to purchase the North Tyneside land and buildings for a combined total of $124 million in cash. The Company expects to record a gain of up to $40 million offset by related restructuring charges of up to $50 million. The timing for recording the gains and restructuring charges will be determined once all selling contingencies and closing conditions are finalized. The transaction is expected to be approximately neutral on a cash flow basis after the elimination of $35 million of debt and the recognition of other financial charges.
This sale follows the previously announced sale of Atmel's Irving, Texas wafer fabrication facility for approximately $38 million in cash. With these transactions and the progress on the Company's other restructuring initiatives, Atmel continues to increase its focus on and investment in the Company's high-growth, high-margin proprietary product lines.
Atmel is a worldwide leader in the design and manufacture of microcontrollers, advanced logic, mixed-signal, nonvolatile memory and radio frequency (RF) components. Leveraging one of the industry's broadest intellectual property (IP) technology portfolios, Atmel provides the electronics industry with complete system solutions focused on consumer, industrial, security, communications, computing and automotive markets.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2007.
SAN JOSE, CA, October 30, 2007
Revenues for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007 were $418.1 million, a 3.4% increase compared to the $404.2 million for the second quarter of 2007 and a 3.2% decrease compared to the $431.7 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006. Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, rose to 35.6% for the third quarter of 2007, an increase of 60 basis points from the prior quarter and a 50 basis points improvement from the same period last year.
Operating profit was $25.4 million for the third quarter, or 6.1 percent of revenue, and included non-recurring charges of $1.5 million for restructuring, impairment and grant repayments. This was an increase of $18.3 million from the prior quarter and a decline of $0.7 million from the year-ago quarter.
Net income for the third quarter of 2007 totaled $16.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $0.7 million or $0.00 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2007 and net income of $124.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter, which included income and gain from discontinued operations of $102 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Income tax provision of $10.1 million for the third quarter was primarily due to statutory taxes at our foreign subsidiaries. Stock-based compensation expense was $4.9 million for the third quarter.
Total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $251 million at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of $225 million from the end of the prior quarter. During the third quarter of 2007, the Company used $250 million to repurchase shares of its common stock under an accelerated stock repurchase program and reduced its debt (current and long-term) $20 million from the prior quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled approximately $46 million in the third quarter.
 
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the third quarter of 2007 was approximately $1.36 to the euro, compared to $1.35 to the euro in the second quarter of 2007 and $1.28 to the euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 increase in the dollar/euro exchange rate reduces operating income by approximately $1 million each quarter.
On August 27, 2007, Atmel announced that its Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company has repurchased $250 million of its common stock. As of this date, an initial 43.4 million shares have been delivered to Atmel, and under this program the Company may receive additional shares during a period of up to four months from September 20, 2007.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 6, 2008, Atmel Corporation ("Atmel or the "Company") issued a press release discussing its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2007. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
.
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.
SAN JOSE, CA, February 6, 2008
"The actions we are taking to focus on core technologies and optimize Atmel's manufacturing operations are supporting improved margins and revenue growth, which exceeded the upper end of our guidance despite the challenging industry environment," said Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Atmel's record microcontroller revenues were driven by our proprietary AVR Flash-based MCUs with overall revenue growth also driven by increasing Serial EEPROM shipments. The acquisition of Quantum Research Group builds on our microcontroller progress and enables us to further expand and strengthen Atmel's proprietary microcontroller product platform in one of the fastest growing segments of microcontrollers. With a stronger foundation in place, Atmel is well positioned for continued success and value creation."
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2007 were $425.6 million, a 1.8% increase compared to $418.1 million for the third quarter of 2007 and a 4.1% increase compared to $408.9 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2006. Revenues for 2007 were $1.64 billion compared to $1.67 billion for 2006 and were impacted by the expected decline of the Company's RF-CDMA foundry business, which decreased $90 million in 2007. Excluding the CDMA foundry revenue fall off, 2007 revenues would have increased 3.9% compared to 2006. Microcontrollers, a core business, continued their double-digit revenue growth driven by 8 and 32-bit products rising 12% in 2007 compared to 2006 and 23% compared to the year-ago quarter.
Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, was 35.2% for the fourth quarter of 2007, in line with expectations as the dollar weakened against the euro in the quarter. This compares to gross profit of 35.6% for the third quarter of 2007 and 35.5% for the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2007, gross profit was 35.4%, a 180 basis points improvement over the 33.6% reported for 2006.
 
Operating profit was $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, or 1.5% of revenue, which includes non-recurring charges of $13.0 million primarily related to restructuring charges for the sale of the North Tyneside, U.K. manufacturing facility and related property. This compares to operating profit of $25.4 million for the third quarter of 2007 and an operating loss of $111.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year 2007, operating profit was $51.7 million, compared to a loss of $62.0 million reported for 2006. Included in the full year operating results were non-recurring charges of $13.6 million for 2007 and $121.3 million for 2006.
Income tax provision was $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This compares to income tax provision of $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2007 and $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year 2007, income tax provision was $7.8 million compared to $24.9 million for 2006. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $20.0 million from the receipt of French R&D tax credits which reduced the full year 2007 income tax provision.
Stock-based compensation expense was $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, compared to $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2007 and $2.5 million for the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2007, stock-based compensation was $16.8 million compared to $9.1 million for the full year 2006.
Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 totaled $1.7 million or $0.00 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $16.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2007 and a net loss of $122.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. Net income for the full year 2007 was $47.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to $14.7 million or $0.03 per diluted share for 2006.
Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $429.9 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of $178.7 million from the end of the prior quarter and a $36.8 million decrease from $466.7 million at December 31, 2006. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company borrowed $100 million against its revolving credit facility and paid down approximately $35 million of equipment leases related to North Tyneside assets. The Company also completed its previously announced $250 million accelerated stock repurchase program under which 48.9 million shares were repurchased. Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $90.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to $44.7 million for the third quarter of 2007 and $22.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2006.
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was approximately $1.43 to the euro, compared to $1.36 to the euro in the third quarter of 2007 and $1.29 to the euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 increase in the dollar/euro exchange rate reduces operating income by approximately $1 million each quarter.
 
Fourth Quarter 2007 and Recent Highlights
Consistent with first quarter business seasonality and general market trends, the Company anticipates first quarter 2008 revenues will be down 3% to 7% on a sequential basis or up 1% to 5% when compared to first quarter 2007. Microcontroller products are expected to continue to grow on a sequential and year-over-year basis driven by new product introductions and market expansion.

For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation, and such notice should be in proper form as discussed below. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days before the one year
 
anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy statement to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made. To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (v) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
     (c) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
 
procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
     A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by a majority of the board of directors, by the chairman of the board or by the president, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. Only such business shall be considered at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been stated in the notice for such meeting. A special meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting has been sent to the stockholders, by a majority of the board of directors.
2.3

The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election.

Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or by courier or deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written communication or other electronic or wireless means.
2.5
Manner Of Giving Notice; Affidavit Of Notice.
     An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
     The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance with Section 2.7 of these Bylaws.
2.6
Quorum.
     When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
 
     If a quorum is initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.
     When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.7

2.8
Voting
     Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     . The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
2.9
Validation Of Meetings; Waiver Of Notice; Consent
     Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
     . Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock or any other class of stock or series thereof having a preference over the Common Stock as dividend or upon liquidation, the stockholders of the corporation may not take action by written consent without a meeting but must take any such actions at a duly called annual or special meeting.
2.10
No Stockholder Action By Written Consent
     . For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, by these Bylaws, by agreement or by applicable law.
2.11

     If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
     A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the board of directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.
     The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws.
     . Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, facsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to the irrevocability of proxies).

The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the corporation's principal executive office. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
2.14
List Of Stockholders Entitled To Vote
 
If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and of the number of shares held by each such stockholder.
     . Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.

          (c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;

Election And Term Of Office Of Directors
          (a) Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these Bylaws, at each annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the corporation shall be elected to hold office until the expiration of the term for which they are elected, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified; except that if any such election shall not be so held, such election shall take place at a stockholders' meeting called and held in accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware. The term of office of a director shall begin immediately after election. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed.
          (b) Each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes of this bylaw, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
          (c) If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the board of directors in accordance with the agreement to be executed by each such nominee as a condition of such nomination. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall make a recommendation to the board of directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board of directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in making its recommendation, and the board of directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the decision of the board of directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the board of directors, such director shall continue to serve until the end of his or her term and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the board of directors pursuant to this bylaw, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 or may decrease the size of the board of directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2.
     . Any director may resign effective on giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors,

If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective.

Each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
     Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws:
               (i) Vacancies, including vacancies from newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
               (ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies, including vacancies from newly created directorships, of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
               (iii) If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to meetings of stockholders).
     If, at the time of filling any vacancy, including vacancies from any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10%) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies, including vacancies from newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to meetings of stockholders) as far as applicable.

6.3
Insurance
     . The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be required to advance expenses to any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless the proceeding was authorized in advance by the board of directors of the corporation.

the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
     . The rights conferred on any person by this bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office.

8.3
Corporate Contracts And Instruments: How Executed
     . The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or
8.4

the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

     Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
     The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
     . If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to transfers of stock, stock certificates and uncertificated stock), in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
8.5
Special Designation On Certificates
     . Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made
8.6
Lost Certificates
 
against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
     . The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
8.7
Transfer Agents And Registrars

8.9
Provisions Additional to Provisions of Law
     . Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these Bylaws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 8.9 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these Bylaws, it being hereby declared that these Bylaws would have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.
8.10
Provisions Contrary To Provisions Of Law
     . Any reference in these Bylaws to the time a notice is given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless means, to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient.
8.11
Notices
     . Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if:
9.1
Notice by Electronic Transmission
 
          (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and
          (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.
     However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
     Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:
          (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
          (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
          (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and
          (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
     An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
     . An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
9.2
Definition of Electronic Transmission
     . Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Section 164 (relating to failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (relating to adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (relating to revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (relating to renewal, revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (relating to attachment of shares of stock or any option, right or interest therein) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
9.3
Inapplicability
     Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the original or other Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
 
     Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of Bylaws with the original Bylaws in the appropriate place. If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

Decisions Regarding Re-election to the Board of Directors
On April 9, 2008, T. Peter Thomas and Chaiho Kim both informed the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Atmel Corporation ("Atmel" or the "Company") that they will not seek re-election to the Board. In order to assure a smooth transition, both Messrs. Thomas and Kim will continue to serve on the Board and Board committees through the Company's 2008 annual meeting of stockholders (the "2008 Annual Meeting").
Appointment of a New Director
On April 9, 2008, the Board appointed Dr. Edward Ross as a director of Atmel. Dr. Ross is currently retired, having previously served as President (2000 through December 2004) and President Emeritus (January 2005 through December 2005) of TSMC North America, the US subsidiary of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., a Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer. Previously, he was Senior Vice President of Synopsys, Inc., an electronic design automation supplier, from 1998 to 2000, and President of Technology and Manufacturing at Cirrus Logic, Inc., a semiconductor manufacturer, from 1995 to 1998. Dr. Ross is a director of California Micro Devices Corporation and Volterra Semiconductor, Inc. Dr. Ross holds a B.S.E.E. from Drexel University and an M.S.E.E., M.A. and Ph.D. from Princeton University.
The Board has not yet appointed Dr. Ross to any Board committees.
In connection with his appointment to the Board, the Board approved: (i) a non-qualified stock option for Dr. Ross, effective April 15, 2008 for the purchase of 40,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value on April 15, 2008 and (ii) 20,000 restricted stock units, or RSUs effective May 15, 2008. Assuming Dr. Ross continues to serve on the Board, (i) such option will vest and become exercisable as to 12.5% of the shares on the 6 month anniversary of the pricing date and monthly thereafter for 42 additional months and (ii) such RSU will vest annually over four years from the effective date. Dr. Ross will also receive a $50,000 annual retainer for his service on the Board.
On April 15, 2008, the Company issued a press release about the new director. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
Effective April 9, 2008, Atmel permitted certain executive officers specified below (the "Executives") to elect to amend certain terms of their stock option grant agreements. The amendments were permitted to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to the Executives and the Company associated with stock options (or any portion of a stock option) with an exercise price that is less than the fair market value of the stock underlying the option on the date of grant that was not vested as of December 31, 2004 ("Discount Options"). The Internal Revenue Service designed special transition rules to protect taxpayers from the adverse tax consequences described above by permitting holders of Discount Options to make an irrevocable election to specify the year in which the holder would exercise his or her Discount Options. Therefore, the Company permitted such amendments based on the findings of the Compensation Committee that the unfavorable tax consequences of Section 409A will significantly decrease the value of the Executives' outstanding stock options and that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders that the Company provide the Executives with an opportunity to mitigate the potential adverse tax consequences associated with the Discount Options.
Certain stock option grants for the individuals specified below were amended to provide for a fixed exercise in calendar year 2009 or a subsequent year, or earlier upon separation of service or change in control, as detailed in the form Stock Option Fixed Exercise Date Election Form filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

On April 9, 2008, the Board of the Company adopted an amendment to Article III, Section 3.2 of the Bylaws to change the number of directors from nine (9) to seven (7). The amendment will become effective immediately prior to the Company's annual meeting of stockholders, scheduled for May 14, 2008.

     The registered office of the corporation shall be fixed in the Certificate of Incorporation of the corporation.
1.1
Registered Office.
     The board of directors may at any time establish branch or subordinate offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.
1.2
Other Offices.
     Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place within or outside the State of Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the board of directors and stated in the notice of the meeting or in a duly executed waiver of notice thereof. The board of directors may determine that a meeting shall not be held at any specific place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication as authorized in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the principal executive office of the corporation.
2.1
Place Of Meeting.
       
2.2
Annual Meeting.
          (a) The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held each year on a date and at a time designated by the board of directors. At the meeting, directors shall be elected, and any other proper business may be transacted.
          (b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be: (A) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (C) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the corporation, and such notice should be in proper form as discussed below. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days before the one year
 
anniversary of the date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy statement to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made. To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (v) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
          (c) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
- 2 -
 
procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
     A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by a majority of the board of directors, by the chairman of the board or by the president, but such special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. Only such business shall be considered at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been stated in the notice for such meeting. A special meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting has been sent to the stockholders, by a majority of the board of directors.
2.3
Special Meeting.
     All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these Bylaws not less than ten (10) (or, if sent by third-class mail pursuant to Section 2.5 of these Bylaws, thirty (30)) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election.
2.4
Notice Of Stockholders' Meetings.
     .  Written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given either (i) personally, (ii) by private courier, (iii) by first- or third-class United States mail, (iv) by other written communication or (v) by other electronic or wireless means. Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or by courier or deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written communication or other electronic or wireless means.
2.5
Manner Of Giving Notice; Affidavit Of Notice
     An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
     .  The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance with Section 2.7 of these Bylaws.
2.6
Quorum
     When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
- 3 -
 
     If a quorum is initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.
     .  When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.7
Adjourned Meeting; Notice
     .  The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these Bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
2.8
Voting
     Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     .  The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
2.9
Validation Of Meetings; Waiver Of Notice; Consent
     Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
     .  Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock or any other class of stock or series thereof having a preference over the Common Stock as dividend or upon liquidation, the stockholders of the corporation may not take action by written consent without a meeting but must take any such actions at a duly called annual or special meeting.
2.10
No Stockholder Action By Written Consent
     .  For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, by these Bylaws, by agreement or by applicable law.
2.11
Record Date For Stockholder Notice; Voting
- 4 -
 
     If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
     A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the board of directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.
     The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws.
     .  Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, facsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to the irrevocability of proxies).
2.12
Proxies
     A written proxy may be in the form of an electronic transmission as described in ARTICLE IX hereof which sets forth or is submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the person.
     .  The president, or in the absence of the president, the chairman of the board, or in the absence of the chairman of the board, any vice president, shall call the meeting of the stockholders to order, and shall act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the president, the chairman of the board, and all of the vice presidents, the stockholders shall appoint a chairman for such meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedures at the meeting, including such matters as the regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business. The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of all meetings of the stockholders, but in the absence of the secretary at any meeting of the stockholders, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
2.13
Organization
     .  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. The corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the corporation's principal executive office. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.
2.14
List Of Stockholders Entitled To Vote
- 5 -
 
If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and of the number of shares held by each such stockholder.
     .  Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
2.15
Inspectors Of Election
          Such inspectors shall:
          (a) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
          (b) receive votes, ballots or consents;
          (c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
          (d) count and tabulate all votes or consents;
          (e) determine when the polls shall close;
          (f) determine the result; and
          (g) do any other acts that may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all stockholders.
     .  Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware and to any limitations in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors.
3.1
Powers
- 6 -
 
     .  The board of directors shall consist of nine (9) members. The number of directors may be changed by an amendment to this bylaw, duly adopted by the board of directors or by the stockholders, or by a duly adopted amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation.

3.3
Election And Term Of Office Of Directors
          (a) Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these Bylaws, at each annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the corporation shall be elected to hold office until the expiration of the term for which they are elected, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified; except that if any such election shall not be so held, such election shall take place at a stockholders' meeting called and held in accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware. The term of office of a director shall begin immediately after election. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed.
          (b) Each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes of this bylaw, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
          (c) If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the board of directors in accordance with the agreement to be executed by each such nominee as a condition of such nomination. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall make a recommendation to the board of directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board of directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in making its recommendation, and the board of directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the decision of the board of directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the board of directors, such director shall continue to serve until the end of his or her term and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the board of directors pursuant to this bylaw, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 or may decrease the size of the board of directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2.
- 7 -
 
     .  Any director may resign effective on giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective. Each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
3.4
Resignation And Vacancies
     Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, vacancies in the board of directors, including vacancies from newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors, may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director; however, a vacancy created by the removal of a director by the vote of the stockholders or by court order may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present (which shares voting affirmatively also constitute a majority of the required quorum). Each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
     Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws:
          (i) Vacancies, including vacancies from newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.

Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
     .  If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to transfers of stock, stock certificates and uncertificated stock), in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
8.5
Special Designation On Certificates
     .  Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made
8.6
Lost Certificates

against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
     .  The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
8.7

8.9
Provisions Additional to Provisions of Law
     .  Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these Bylaws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 8.9 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these Bylaws, it being hereby declared that these Bylaws would have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.
8.10
Provisions Contrary To Provisions Of Law
     .  Any reference in these Bylaws to the time a notice is given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless means, to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient.

          (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and
          (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.
     However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
     Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:
          (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
          (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;

     An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

Table of Contents

 
Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2008.
SAN JOSE, CA, April 30, 2008
Revenues for the first quarter of 2008 were $411.2 million, a 3.4% decrease compared to $425.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and a 5.1% increase compared to $391.3 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2007. Microcontrollers, a core business, continued solid revenue growth and rose 8% sequentially and 21% compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the Company's proprietary AVR and standard ARM products.
Net income for the first quarter of 2008 totaled $6.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $1.7 million or $0.00 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2007 and net income of $28.9 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2008 totaled $13.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to $20.0 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $33.7 million or $0.07 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income excludes charges (credits) related to stock-based compensation, acquisitions, grant repayments, and restructuring activities, as well as the gain on sale of assets and the income tax effect of these excluded items. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included following the financial statements below.
"We are pleased to have achieved the upper end of our revenue guidance and record microcontroller revenues," said Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "These results reflect the strength of our product offering and the benefits we are realizing from refocusing Atmel's business operations on areas that offer the best opportunity for profitable growth. As we move forward, I have confidence that our product innovation and technology leadership, further strengthened by our recent acquisition of Quantum Research Group, positions Atmel for continued success."
 
Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, was 35.5% for the first quarter of 2008. This compares to gross profit of 35.2% for the fourth quarter of 2007 and 35.8% for the year-ago quarter. Gross profit for the first quarter of 2008 was negatively impacted by underutilization as production activity ended at our manufacturing facility in North Tyneside, United Kingdom and by the continuing weakness of the dollar against the euro.
Operating profit was $15.4 million for the first quarter of 2008, or 3.7% of revenue, which includes net non-recurring charges of $0.9 million related to the sale of the North Tyneside assets as well as charges resulting from the Quantum Research Group acquisition completed during the quarter. This compares to an operating profit of $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $12.8 million for the first quarter of 2007. Included in the 2007 operating results were non-recurring charges of $13.0 million for the fourth quarter related to North Tyneside restructuring charges and $1.8 million for the first quarter of 2007 related to restructuring charges for employee severances at other locations. Stock-based compensation expense was $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2008, compared to $5.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $3.3 million for the year-ago quarter.
Income tax provision was $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2008. This compares to an income tax provision of $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and a net income tax benefit of $15.2 million for the first quarter of 2007. The Company recognized a tax benefit of approximately $3.2 million and $20.0 million from the receipt of French R&D tax credits in the first quarters of 2008 and 2007, respectively.
Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $336.8 million at the end of the first quarter of 2008, a decrease of $93.1 million from the end of the prior quarter and a $141.9 million decrease from $478.7 million at March 31, 2007. During the first quarter of 2008, the Company used approximately $89.0 million for the purchase of Quantum Research Group. Cash used in operations totaled approximately $41.0 million for the first quarter of 2008 compared to cash provided from operations of $90.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007 and $59.2 million for the first quarter of 2007. Cash used in operations in the first quarter of 2008 included approximately $54.0 million of cash used for repayment of grants and other restructuring charges related to the closure of North Tyneside. Separately, the Company received approximately $82.0 million of proceeds from the sale of North Tyneside fabrication equipment classified as proceeds from investing activities.
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the first quarter of 2008 was approximately $1.47 to the euro, compared to $1.43 to the euro in the fourth quarter of 2007 and $1.32 to the euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 increase in the dollar/euro exchange rate reduced operating income by approximately $0.6 million during the first quarter of 2008.
First Quarter 2008 and Recent Highlights
 
Business Outlook
Consistent with business seasonality and general market trends, the Company anticipates second quarter 2008 revenues will be up 0% to 3% on a sequential basis.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations.
 
In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the consolidated statements of operations.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.

Table of Contents

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.
SAN JOSE, CA, July 30, 2008
Revenues for the second quarter of 2008 were $420.9 million, a 2.4% increase compared to $411.2 million for the first quarter of 2008 and a 4.1% increase compared to $404.2 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007. Microcontrollers, a core business, continued to deliver solid revenue growth rising 9% sequentially and 29% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by the Company's proprietary AVR, standard ARM and touch sensing products.
Net loss for the second quarter of 2008 totaled $(4.9) million or $(0.01) per diluted share. This compares to net income of $6.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008 and net income of $0.7 million or $0.00 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2008 totaled $17.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to $13.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008 and $1.3 million or $0.00 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income excludes charges (credits) related to restructuring activities, acquisitions, grant repayments, and stock-based compensation, as well as the loss (gain) on sale of assets and the income tax effect of these excluded items. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included following the financial statements below.
"We are pleased to have reached the upper end of our revenue guidance in spite of the challenging macroeconomic environment," said Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "In addition to achieving record microcontroller revenues, gross profit continued to increase. The restructuring initiatives and manufacturing disciplines we've implemented are enabling Atmel to drive technological leadership with innovative and cost-effective products that offer the best opportunity for profitable growth."
 
Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, was 36.5% for the second quarter of 2008. This compares to gross profit of 35.5% for the first quarter of 2008 and 35.0% for the year-ago quarter. Gross profit for the second quarter of 2008 was influenced by a favorable mix of higher margin core products as well as improved wafer fab utilization following the closure of the North Tyneside, United Kingdom manufacturing facility.
Operating profit was $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2008, or 0.1% of revenue, which includes charges of $16.5 million primarily related to restructuring and charges resulting from the Quantum Research Group acquisition completed in March of this year. This compares to an operating profit of $15.4 million for the first quarter of 2008 and $7.1 million for the second quarter of 2007. Included in the prior period operating results were net charges of $0.7 million for the first quarter related to the North Tyneside restructuring and Quantum Research acquisition and a benefit of $2.6 million for the second quarter of 2007 for restructuring related adjustments. Stock-based compensation expense was $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2008, compared to $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2008 and $3.3 million for the year-ago quarter.
Income tax provision was $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2008. This compares to an income tax provision of $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2008 and $7.1 million for the second quarter of 2007.
Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $375.8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2008, an increase of $39.0 million from the end of the prior quarter and a $54.2 million decrease from $429.9 million at December 31, 2007. Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $50.0 million for the second quarter of 2008 compared to cash used in operations of $40.2 million for the first quarter of 2008 and $1.5 million for the second quarter of 2007. In the first quarter of 2008, cash used in operations included approximately $54.0 million of cash used for repayment of grants and for restructuring charges that required cash payments related to the closure of North Tyneside. Also, in the first quarter of 2008, the Company received approximately $82.0 million of proceeds from the sale of North Tyneside fabrication equipment, which was classified as proceeds from investing activities.
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the second quarter of 2008 was approximately $1.56 to the euro, compared to $1.47 to the euro in the first quarter of 2008 and $1.35 to the euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 increase in the dollar/euro exchange rate reduced operating income by approximately $0.5 million during the second quarter of 2008, which was an improvement over the $1.0 million impact to operating income at the end of 2007 as a result of the dollar/euro exchange rate.
Second Quarter 2008 and Recent Highlights
 
Business Outlook
To better manage distribution resources, on July 1, 2008, Atmel implemented a change in revenue recognition with regards to its independent distributors in Europe converting from a sell-in to a sell-through revenue model. As a result, the Company expects that there will be a one time revenue reduction of approximately $28 million to $34 million to third quarter revenues. Including this one time accounting adjustment, third quarter 2008 revenues are expected to be down 3% to 7% sequentially. Exclusive of this change and consistent with business seasonality and macro economic trends, the Company anticipates third quarter 2008 revenues would be up 1% to 4% on a sequential basis.
st
Atmel is continuing to evaluate ways to safeguard its ability to compete in the market. In this context, the French management is commencing a consultation procedure with the works councils in France in relation to potential redundancies in the operations in Rousset and Nantes, France. Atmel is also continually reviewing potential changes in its business and asset portfolio throughout its worldwide operations, including those located in Europe in order to enhance its overall competitiveness and viability.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net (Loss) Income to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Restructuring charges (credits) primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges (credits) are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges (credits) from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
Atmel recognizes losses (gains) resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these losses (gains) are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.

Table of Contents
Change of Control Severance Plan
On August 5, 2008, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee) of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") approved the principal design terms for a change of control severance plan (the "Plan"). Pursuant to the principal design terms for the Plan, certain employees, including the Company's executive officers other than the Company's Chief Executive Officer, will be eligible to participate in the Plan provided that each individual executes a participation agreement, waives his or her right to any severance provided under any other agreement or plan, and agrees to an amendment to any existing employment or other agreement pursuant to which such individual is entitled to severance benefits (an "Eligible Participant").
In accordance with the principal design terms for the Plan, an Eligible Participant will be entitled to receive the following severance benefits, contingent on such individual signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims in favor of the Company and not soliciting any employee of the Company for a period of twelve (12) months or nine (9) months depending on whether the Eligible Participant is identified as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 employee, respectively:
Forms of Restricted Stock Unit Agreements
On August 5, 2008, the Committee also approved forms of Restricted Stock Unit Agreements for use under the Atmel Corporation 2005 Stock Plan (the "2005 Plan").
The Restricted Stock Unit Agreements provide for the grant of a maximum number of restricted stock units that will be paid out in shares of Company common stock once the applicable operating margin performance criteria have been met.
General Terms.
Table of Contents
     . The Restricted Stock Unit Agreements provide that during the performance period beginning July 1, 2008, and ending December 31, 2011, a portion of the restricted stock units may become eligible to vest for each quarterly performance period beginning on or after April 1, 2009 (provided, that, in the case of a new hire, the recipient has been a service provider for at least four full quarterly performance periods). The number of restricted stock units in which the recipient may vest for each such quarterly performance period will depend upon achievement with respect to the operating margin performance criteria. However, if a Change of Control (as such term is defined in the Restricted Stock Units Agreements) occurs during the performance period, the performance period will be deemed to end immediately prior to the Change of Control and the vesting of the restricted stock units subject to the Restricted Stock Unit Agreements will convert to a time-based vesting schedule. The number of restricted stock units in which the recipient will be entitled to vest in accordance with the time-based vesting schedule will equal fifty percent (50%) of the maximum number of restricted stock units subject to the award less the number of any previously vested restricted stock units.
Vesting
     Generally, restricted stock units that have not vested by the time of a recipient's termination of service with the Company will be forfeited. However, the Restricted Stock Unit Agreements provide that in the event that the recipient incurs a termination of service within three (3) months before or twelve (12) months following a Change in Control either (i) by the Company for any reason other than for Cause (as such term is defined in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreements), or (ii) by the recipient for Good Reason (as such term is defined in the Restricted Stock Agreements), then all unvested restricted stock units (determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Unit Agreements) will fully vest.
     This summary of the terms of the Restricted Stock Unit Agreements is qualified in its entirety by the Restricted Stock Unit Agreements attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2.

While any disqualification, bar or loss continues during the Participant's employment, the Participant will serve in the capacity contemplated by his or her position to whatever extent legally permissible and, if the Participant's employment is not permissible, he or she will be placed on leave (which will be paid to the extent legally permissible).

For purposes of this Award Agreement, "Change of Control" will mean the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the consummation by the Company of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 50% of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; (ii) the consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; (iii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becoming the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding voting securities; or (iv) a change in the composition of the Board occurring within a one-year period, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors. "Incumbent Directors" will mean directors who either (A) are directors of the Company as of the date hereof, or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of those directors whose election or nomination was not in connection with any transactions described in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) or in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors of the Company.

For purposes of this Award Agreement, "Good Reason" will mean the Participant's termination of employment within ninety (90) days following the end of the Cure Period (as defined below) as a result of the occurrence of any of the following without the Participant's consent: (i) a material diminution of the Participant's authority, duties, or responsibilities, relative to the Participant's authority, duties, or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction, provided, however, that a reduction of authority, duties, or responsibilities that occurs solely as a necessary and direct consequence of the Company undergoing a Change of Control and being made part of a larger entity will not be considered material, (ii) a material diminution by the Company in the base salary of the Participant as in effect immediately prior to such reduction (unless the Company also reduces the base salary of substantially all other employees of the Company), or (iii) the relocation of the Participant to a facility or a location more than fifty (50) miles from the Participant's then present location; provided, however, that the Participant must provide written notice to the Board of the condition that could constitute a "Good Reason" event within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such condition and such condition must not have been remedied by the Company within thirty (30) days (the "Cure Period") of such written notice.
 
   5. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, if the Participant ceases to be a Service Provider for any or no reason, the then-unvested Restricted Stock Units (after taking into account any accelerated vesting that may occur as the result of any such termination, including in accordance with Section 4.2 above) awarded by this Award Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company and the Participant will have no further rights thereunder.
Forfeiture upon Termination of Continuous Service
   6. . Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 or 4 will be paid to the Participant (or in the event of the Participant's death, to his or her estate) in whole Shares as soon as administratively practicable following the applicable Vesting Date, subject to paragraph 8, but in each such case no later than the date that is two-and-one-half months from the end of the Company's tax year that includes the Vesting Date. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with the Participant ceasing to be a Service Provider (provided that such cessation is a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to death, and if (x) the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such cessation and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to the Participant on or within the six (6) month period following the Participant ceasing to be a Service Provider, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of such cessation, unless the Participant dies during such six (6) month period, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be paid to the Participant's estate as soon as practicable following his or her death, subject to paragraph 8. It is the intent of this Award Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply. For purposes of this Award Agreement, "Section 409A" means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and any proposed, temporary or final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time.
Payment after Vesting
   7. . Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Participant under this Award Agreement will, if the Participant is then deceased, be made to the Participant's designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives the Participant, the administrator or executor of the Participant's estate.

Payments after Death
   8. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, no certificate representing the Shares will be issued to the Participant, unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) will have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of income, employment and other taxes which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to such shares so issuable. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit the Participant to satisfy such tax withholding obligation, in whole or in part (without limitation) by one or more of the following: (a) paying cash, (b) electing to have the Company withhold otherwise deliverable shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be

If the Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any required tax withholding obligations hereunder at the time any applicable Shares otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4, the Participant will permanently forfeit such Shares and the Shares will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company.
   9. . Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
Rights as Stockholder
   10. . The Participant's employment or other service with the Company and its Subsidiaries is on an at-will basis only.

Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Award, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this Award and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.

4.3. Definitions.
               4.3.1. For purposes of this Award Agreement, "Cause" will mean (i) the Participant's willful and continued failure to perform the duties and responsibilities of his or her position after there has been delivered to the Participant a written demand for performance from the [CEOBoard] which describes the basis for the [: CEO's] [: Board] belief that the Participant has not substantially performed his or her duties and the Participant has not corrected such failure within 30 days of such written demand; (ii) any act of personal dishonesty taken by the Participant in connection with his or her responsibilities as an employee of the Company with the intention or reasonable expectation that such action may result in the substantial personal enrichment of the Participant; (iii) the Participant's conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony that the Board reasonably believes has had or will have a material detrimental effect on the Company's reputation or business; (iv) a breach of any fiduciary duty owed to the Company by the Participant that has a material detrimental effect on the Company's reputation or business; (v) the Participant being found liable in any Securities and Exchange Commission or other civil or criminal securities law action or entering any cease and desist order with respect to such action (regardless of whether or not the Participant admits or denies liability); (vi) the Participant (A) obstructing or impeding; (B) endeavoring to influence, obstruct or impede, or (C) failing to materially cooperate with, any investigation authorized by the Board or any governmental or self-regulatory entity (an "Investigation"). However, the Participant's failure to waive attorney-client privilege relating to communications with his or her own attorney in connection with an Investigation will not constitute "Cause"; or (vii) the Participant's disqualification or bar by any governmental or self-regulatory authority from serving in the capacity contemplated by his or her position or the Participant's loss of

any governmental or self-regulatory license that is reasonably necessary for the Participant to perform his or her responsibilities to the Company, if (A) the disqualification, bar or loss continues for more than thirty (30) days, and (B) during that period the Company uses its good faith efforts to cause the disqualification or bar to be lifted or the license replaced. While any disqualification, bar or loss continues during the Participant's employment, the Participant will serve in the capacity contemplated by his or her position to whatever extent legally permissible and, if the Participant's employment is not permissible, he or she will be placed on leave (which will be paid to the extent legally permissible).

For purposes of this Award Agreement, "Change of Control" will mean the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the consummation by the Company of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 50% of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; (ii) the consummation of the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets; (iii) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becoming the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 50% of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding voting securities; or (iv) a change in the composition of the Board occurring within a one-year period, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors. "Incumbent Directors" will mean directors who either (A) are directors of the Company as of the date hereof, or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of those directors whose election or nomination was not in connection with any transactions described in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) or in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors of the Company.

     5. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, if the Participant ceases to be a Service Provider for any or no reason, the then-unvested Restricted Stock Units (after taking into account any accelerated vesting that may occur as the result of any such termination, including in accordance with Section 4.2 above) awarded by this Award Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company and the Participant will have no further rights thereunder.
Forfeiture upon Termination of Continuous Service
     6. . Any Restricted Stock Units that vest in accordance with paragraph 3 or 4 will be paid to the Participant (or in the event of the Participant's death, to his or her estate) in whole Shares as soon as administratively practicable following the applicable Vesting Date, subject to paragraph 8, but in each such case no later than the date that is two-and-one-half months from the end of the Company's tax year that includes the Vesting Date. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement to the contrary, if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with the Participant ceasing to be a Service Provider (provided that such cessation is a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Company), other than due to death, and if (x) the Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such cessation and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to the Participant on or within the six (6) month period following the Participant ceasing to be a Service Provider, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of such cessation, unless the Participant dies during such six (6) month period, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be paid to the Participant's estate as soon as practicable following his or her death, subject to paragraph 8. It is the intent of this Award Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply. For purposes of this Award Agreement, "Section 409A" means Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and any proposed, temporary or final Treasury Regulations and Internal Revenue Service guidance thereunder, as each may be amended from time to time.
Payment after Vesting
     7. . Any distribution or delivery to be made to the Participant under this Award Agreement will, if the Participant is then deceased, be made to the Participant's designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives the Participant, the administrator or executor of the Participant's estate. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.
Payments after Death
     8. . Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, no certificate representing the Shares will be issued to the Participant, unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) will have been made by the Participant with respect to the payment of income, employment and other taxes which the Company determines must be withheld with respect to such shares so issuable.

withheld, (c) delivering to the Company already vested and owned shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or (d) selling a sufficient number of such shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable to Participant through such means as the Company may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the amount required to be withheld. If the Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any required tax withholding obligations hereunder at the time any applicable Shares otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to paragraph 3 or 4, the Participant will permanently forfeit such Shares and the Shares will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company.
     9. . Neither the Participant nor any person claiming under or through the Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to the Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, the Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
Rights as Stockholder
     10. . The Participant's employment or other service with the Company and its Subsidiaries is on an at-will basis only. Accordingly, the terms of the Participant's employment or service with the Company and its Subsidiaries will be determined from time to time by the Company or the Subsidiary employing the Participant (as the case may be), and the Company or the Subsidiary will have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate or change the terms of the employment or service of the Participant at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause.

Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of this Award, or any right or privilege conferred hereby, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process, this Award and the rights and privileges conferred hereby immediately will become null and void.

Table of Contents

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
SAN JOSE, CA, October 29, 2008
On a GAAP basis which includes a one-time reduction of approximately $19.9 million relating to the previously announced conversion of European distributors to a sell-through model from a sell-in model, revenues for the third quarter of 2008 were $400.0 million. As a result, third quarter revenues decreased 5.0% compared to $420.9 million for the second quarter of 2008 and decreased 4.3% compared to $418.1 million for the third quarter of 2007. Net loss for the third quarter of 2008 totaled $(4.7) million or $(0.01) per diluted share. This compares to net loss of $(4.9) million or $(0.01) per diluted share for the second quarter of 2008 and net income of $16.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.
Excluding the one-time conversion, management estimates third quarter revenues would have decreased 0.2% sequentially and grew 0.4% compared to the year-ago quarter. Management estimates the one-time revenue adjustment and associated margin impact had the effect of reducing net income by $10.0 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2008 on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.
 
Non-GAAP net income (including the accounting adjustments for conversion of European distributors to sell-through model) for the third quarter of 2008 totaled $42.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to $17.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2008 and $22.8 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. Management estimates non-GAAP net income (excluding the accounting adjustments for conversion of European distributors to sell-through model) for the third quarter of 2008 would have totaled $52.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share.
"Atmel's significantly improved gross profit margins, the highest achieved in seven years, reflect the substantial improvement of our manufacturing operations as well as the strength of our microcontroller and other core businesses," said Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "During the quarter, we launched a number of new products in our microcontroller business that are receiving strong acceptance from Atmel's customers, and we anticipate continued market share gains. In addition, we took further steps to enhance the Company's manufacturing operations with the announced sale of our wafer fab in Germany and restructuring initiatives in France. While further actions are underway, the benefits we are already realizing from Atmel's transformation are a clear indication that we are making significant progress in unlocking Atmel's full potential and maximizing shareholder value."
Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, was 39.5% for the third quarter of 2008. This compares to gross profit of 36.5% for the second quarter of 2008 and 35.6% for the year-ago quarter. The 300 basis points sequential improvement to gross profit was driven primarily by improved manufacturing utilization as a result of the Company's strategic restructuring initiatives, productivity improvements, and by a stronger mix of higher margin microcontroller and other core products.
Operating loss was $(11.3) million for the third quarter of 2008, or (2.8)% of revenue. This compares to an operating profit of $0.2 million for the second quarter of 2008 and $25.4 million for the third quarter of 2007. Included in the third quarter 2008 operating loss was $41.6 million of charges related to restructuring, asset impairment, acquisition, and grant repayments. Stock-based compensation expense for the third quarter of 2008 was $7.4 million, compared to $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2008 and $4.9 million for the year-ago quarter.
Income tax benefit was $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2008. This compares to an income tax provision of $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2008 and $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2007.
Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $420.9 million at the end of the third quarter of 2008, an increase of $45.1 million from the end of the prior quarter and a decrease of $9.0 million from the year-end balance at December 31, 2007. Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $67.0 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $50.0 million for the second quarter of 2008 and $45.0 million for the third quarter of 2007.
 
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the third quarter of 2008 was $1.54 to the euro, compared to $1.56 to the euro in the second quarter of 2008 and $1.36 to the euro in the year-ago period.
Third Quarter 2008 and Recent Operational Highlights
Recent Product Highlights
Business Outlook
The Company currently anticipates fourth quarter 2008 revenues will be down 3% to up 3% from the $400.0 million recognized in the third quarter of 2008. Due to the continued actions underway as part of the Company's transformation plan, Atmel expects to see continued improvement in gross profit margins.
Non-GAAP
Non-GAAP net income excludes charges related to restructuring activities, acquisitions, grant repayments, asset impairment charges (recovery) and stock-based compensation, as well as the loss (gain) on the sale of assets and the income tax effect of these excluded items. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included following the financial statements below.

Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements
Information in this release regarding Atmel's forecasts, outlook, expectations and beliefs are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include statements about new product introductions, markets for our products and market share gains, restructuring initiatives, manufacturing optimization, cost savings strategies and future operating and financial performance. All forward-looking statements included in this release are based upon information available to Atmel as of the date of this release, which may change, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include general economic conditions, the impact of competitive products and pricing, timely design acceptance by our customers, timely introduction of new products and technologies, ability to ramp new products into volume production, industry wide shifts in supply and demand for semiconductor products, industry and/or Company overcapacity, effective and cost efficient utilization of manufacturing capacity, financial stability in foreign markets and the impact of foreign exchange rates, the inability to realize the anticipated benefits of our recent strategic transactions, restructuring plans and other initiatives in a timely manner or at all, unanticipated costs and expenses or the inability to identify expenses which can be eliminated, impact of Microchip's and ON Semiconductor's unsolicited acquisition proposal and the Company's response thereto, the market price of our common stock, unfavorable results of legal proceedings and other risks detailed from time to time in Atmel's SEC reports and filings, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, filed on February 29, 2008, and our subsequent Form 10-Q reports.
 
 
 
 
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non- GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net (Loss) Income to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in
 
accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes losses (gains) resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these losses (gains) are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Atmel classifies assets as held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when the decision is made to sell the asset. The Company then records an impairment charge (recovery) as the difference between the fair value, less any selling costs, and the carrying value. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.
In the three months ended September 30, 2008, Atmel converted certain of its distributors in Europe from a "sell-in" revenue recognition model to a "sell through" or "ship and debit" model. This conversion resulted in a one-time reduction in revenue of approximately $19.9 million, and an increase in cost of revenue of approximately $9.2 million, in the three months ended September 30, 2008. Atmel excludes these items from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these items are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.

Item 3.03          Material Modification to Rights of Security Holders.
Atmel Corporation (the "Company" or "Atmel") has entered into an Amendment, dated as of November 10, 2008 (the "Rights Agreement Amendment"), by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as successor Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent") to EquiServe, L.P., to its Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of October 18, 1999 ("Rights Agreement"), by and between the Company and EquiServe, L.P., as successor to BankBoston, N.A. This action was taken in response to the November 7, 2008 expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), which provides Microchip Technology Inc. ("Microchip") regulatory clearance to purchase 50 percent or more of Atmel's outstanding common stock.
The Rights Agreement Amendment is designed to guard against a creeping accumulation of Atmel's common stock by Microchip at an inadequate price during the current period of extraordinary volatility and disruption in the stock market, which would result in unequal treatment of Atmel stockholders and impair the Company's ability to maximize shareholder value through the continued execution of the Company's transformation plan. As announced on October 29, 2008, after a comprehensive review, and with advice from outside financial and legal advisors, Atmel's Board of Directors unanimously determined that the October 1, 2008, unsolicited proposal from Microchip and ON Semiconductor Corporation ("ON") is inadequate in multiple respects, as it significantly undervalues the Company, is unacceptably conditional, subject to significant execution risk, and is not in the best interests of Atmel's stockholder s.
The Rights Agreement previously provided that beneficial ownership of 20 percent or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company would cause the acquiror to become an Acquiring Person, as defined in the Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement Amendment reduces this 20 percent threshold to 10 percent for persons or groups, such as Microchip and ON, that have made offers or proposals on or after October 1, 2008 to acquire 50 percent or more of Atmel's stock or assets.
The Rights Agreement Amendment also amends the definition of "beneficial ownership" to include derivative interests in any contract that is designed to produce economic benefits and detriments to the applicable party that correspond substantially to the ownership by such party of a number of shares of the Company's common stock, regardless of whether obligations under such contract are settled through the delivery of cash, the Company's common stock or other property.
The Rights Agreement Amendment also appoints American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC as successor Rights Agent under the Rights Agreement.
The foregoing description of the Rights Agreement Amendment is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights Agreement Amendment, which is filed as Exhibit 4.2 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form 8-A/A, dated November 10, 2008, and is incorporated by reference herein. Reference is also hereby made to the Registration Statement on Form 8-A filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 15, 1998, and the amendments thereto filed on December 6, 1999 and November 10, 2008, in each case relating to the Rights Agreement, as amended. Such Registration Statement on Form 8-A, as amended, is hereby incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 99.1
. . . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced that it is revising its fourth quarter 2008 business outlook as previously provided on October 29, 2008. The revised expectations reflect the global economic weakness and rapid slowdown in demand across the semiconductor industry. Atmel also announced new actions to reduce costs and manufacturing capacity, given the current environment.
SAN JOSE, CA, December 15, 2008
The Company now estimates fourth quarter 2008 revenues will be down 12% to 18% from the $400 million recognized in the third quarter of 2008. Gross profit margins in the fourth quarter of 2008 are expected to be in the range of 37% to 38%. Atmel expects operating expenses to be at the lower end of its previously announced range of $125 million to $129 million.
"Atmel, like many companies in our industry, is seeing the effects of the broader economic decline, particularly in our memory and automotive product lines," said Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We believe the actions we are taking to reduce costs and manufacturing capacity, together with our previously announced transformation plan, will mitigate these market challenges and support Atmel's continued product leadership and market share gains."
Atmel is taking actions to reduce operating expenses and align production with current market conditions. These actions include:
As a result of the workforce reduction, Atmel expects to realize approximately $18 million of savings on an annualized basis and incur one-time charges of approximately $4 million related to severance in the 2008 fourth quarter.
 
These actions are in addition to the previously announced 11-day shutdown of the Company's manufacturing facilities in Colorado Springs, Colorado and Rousset, France. Atmel also affirmed that it has completed its previously announced redundancy plan in France, affecting approximately 200 positions.
Laub continued, "To manage through this environment, we are taking necessary and prudent steps to ensure Atmel's competitiveness and our ability to serve our customers. Such decisions are difficult, and we are committed to helping smooth the transition for affected employees."

Exhibit 10.1
   This Amended Employment Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into effective as of December 31, 2008, by and between Atmel Corporation (the "Company") and Steven Laub ("Executive") and amends and restates the employment agreement entered into as of August 6, 2006, by the Company and Executive, and amended effective as of March 13, 2007.
     1. .
Duties and Scope of Employment
          (a) . As of December 31, 2008, Executive will continue to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President. Executive will report to the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board"). Further, Executive will continue to render such business and professional services in the performance of his duties, consistent with Executive's position within the Company, as will reasonably be assigned to him by the Board. The period Executive is employed by the Company under this Agreement is referred to herein as the "Employment Term".
Positions and Duties
          (b) . As of December 31, 2008, Executive will continue to serve as a member of the Board. At each annual meeting of the Company's stockholders during the Employment Term, the Company will nominate Executive to serve as a member of the Board. Executive's service as a member of the Board will be subject to any required stockholder approval. Upon the termination of Executive's employment for any reason, unless otherwise requested by the Board, Executive will be deemed to have resigned from the Board (and all other positions held at the Company and its affiliates) voluntarily, without any further required action by Executive, as of the end of Executive's employment and Executive, at the Board's request, will execute any documents necessary to reflect his resignation.
Board Membership
          (c) . During the Employment Term, Executive, except as provided below, will devote Executive's full business efforts and time to the Company and will use good faith efforts to discharge Executive's obligations under this Agreement to the best of Executive's ability and in accordance with each of the Company's written corporate guidance and ethics guidelines, conflict of interests policies and code of conduct. For the duration of the Employment Term, Executive agrees not to actively engage in any other employment, occupation, or consulting activity for any direct or indirect remuneration without the prior approval of the Board (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that Executive may, without the approval of the Board, (i) serve in any capacity with any civic, educational, professional, industry or charitable organization, provided such services do not interfere with Executive's obligations to Company, and (ii) serve on the board of directors of one (1) company of his choosing, with such company to be reasonably acceptable to the Board (currently Teridian Semiconductor Corporation, as to which Executive is paid by Golden Gate Capital and such service will not constitute a violation of this Section 1(c)).
Obligations
               (i) Executive hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Executive is not party to any contract, understanding, agreement or policy, written or otherwise, that would be breached by Executive's entering into, or performing services under, this
 
Agreement. Executive further represents that he disclosed to the Company in writing all threatened, pending, or actual claims that were unresolved and still outstanding as of August 6, 2006, in each case, against Executive of which he was aware, if any, as a result of his employment with any previous employer or his membership on any boards of directors.
          (d) . Executive agrees to serve and will be appointed, without additional compensation, as an officer and director for each of the Company's subsidiaries, partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability companies and other affiliates, including entities in which the Company has a significant investment as determined by the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliates" will mean any entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control of the Company.
Other Entities
     2. . Executive and the Company agree that Executive's employment with the Company constitutes "at-will" employment. Executive and the Company acknowledge that this employment relationship may be terminated at any time, upon written notice to the other party, with or without good cause or for any or no cause, at the option either of the Company or Executive. However, as described in this Agreement, Executive may be entitled to severance benefits depending upon the circumstances of Executive's termination of employment.
At-Will Employment
     3. .
Compensation
          (a) . The Company will pay Executive an annual salary of $755,000 as compensation for his services (such annual salary, as is then effective, to be referred to herein as "Base Salary"). Executive's Base Salary will be subject to annual review (subject to the provisions of Section 10(e)(iii) of this Agreement). The Base Salary will be paid periodically in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices and will be subject to the usual, required withholdings.
Base Salary
          (b) . Executive will be eligible to receive annual cash incentives payable for the achievement of performance goals established by the Board or by the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Committee"). During the Employment Term, Executive's target annual incentive ("Target Annual Incentive") will be not less than 100% of Base Salary. For fiscal 2008, Executive's Target Annual Incentive is 125% of Base Salary. The actual earned annual cash incentive, if any, payable to Executive for any performance period will depend upon the extent to which the applicable performance goal(s) specified by the Committee with the input of Executive are achieved or exceeded and will be adjusted for under- or over-performance.
Annual Incentive
          (c) .
Equity Awards
               (i) As of August 7, 2006, Executive was granted a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 1,450,000 shares of Company common stock at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the Nasdaq National Market ("Nasdaq") for the common stock of the Company on August 7, 2006 (the "Initial Option"). The Initial Option was granted under and is subject to the terms, definitions and provisions of the Company's 2005 Stock Plan (the "Plan") and was and is scheduled to vest at a rate of 25% of the shares subject to the Initial
 
Option on the first anniversary of the grant and 1/48 of the shares was and is scheduled to vest monthly thereafter assuming Executive's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date. Except as provided in this Agreement, the Initial Option is subject to the Company's standard terms and conditions for options granted under the Plan.
               (ii) On January 2, 2007, the Company granted to Executive a nonstatutory stock option to purchase 500,000 shares of Company common stock at a per share exercise price equal to the closing price per share on the Nasdaq for the common stock of the Company on January 2, 2007 (the "Additional Option"). The Additional Option was granted under and is subject to the same terms, definitions and provisions applicable to the Initial Option, and was and is scheduled to vest at a rate of 25% of the shares subject to the award on August 7, 2007, and the remainder of the shares was and is scheduled to vest pro-rata monthly over the three (3) year period commencing on August 7, 2007, assuming Executive's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date. In addition, on July 11, 2007, the Company granted 1,000,000 restricted stock units to Executive under and subject to the same terms, definitions and provisions applicable to the Initial Option assuming exercise thereof, except that such shares were and are scheduled to vest at a rate of 25% of the shares subject to the award vesting on August 7, 2007, and the remainder of the shares was and is scheduled to vest pro-rata quarterly over the three (3) year period commencing on August 7, 2007, assuming Executive's continued employment with the Company on each scheduled vesting date. The Company agrees (to the extent permitted by the Company's Insider Trading Policy), at the request of Executive, to facilitate the implementation by Executive of a 10b5-1 trading plan to accommodate Executive's ability to sell such portion of the relevant shares as may be necessary to cover Executive's tax withholding obligations with respect to such vesting, if any, at such tax rate as Executive may specify. If the Company's Insider Trading Policy does not permit the implementation of a 10b5-1 trading plan, Executive will be allowed to have the Company withhold the number of shares necessary to satisfy his minimum tax withholding obligation.
               (iii) Executive has received grants of equity awards under the Plan other than the equity awards described in Section 3(c)(i) and (ii) above. As determined by the Committee, Executive will continue to be eligible for grants of equity compensation awards under the Plan (or any other stock plan maintained by the Company) in accordance with the Company's policies, as in effect from time to time, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee determines, including vesting criteria such as continued service or performance objectives.
     4. .

Generally
          (b) . Executive will be entitled to receive paid annual vacation in accordance with Company policy for other senior executive officers, but with vacation accrual of not less than four (4) weeks per year.
Vacation
 
     5. . The Company will reimburse Executive for reasonable travel, entertainment and other expenses incurred by Executive in the furtherance of the performance of Executive's duties hereunder, in accordance with the Company's expense reimbursement policy as in effect from time to time.

In the event Executive's employment with the Company terminates for any reason, Executive will be entitled to any (a) unpaid Base Salary accrued up to the effective date of termination; (b) unpaid, but earned and accrued annual incentive for any completed fiscal year as of his termination of employment; (c) pay for accrued but unused vacation; (d) benefits or compensation as provided under the terms of any employee benefit and compensation agreements or plans applicable to Executive; (e) unreimbursed business expenses required to be reimbursed to Executive; and (f) rights to indemnification Executive may have under the Company's Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, this Agreement, and/or separate indemnification agreement, as applicable. In the event Executive's employment with the Company terminates for any reason, Executive will be entitled to exercise any outstanding stock options for at least twelve (12) months after the later of such termination of employment or the date upon which Executive ceases to provide any other services to the Company or any of its affiliates, whether as a director, independent contractor or otherwise, but in no event later than the applicable scheduled expiration date of such award (in the absence of any termination of employment) as set forth in the award agreement. In the event Executive's employment with the Company terminates due to death or Disability, then there will be acceleration of vesting of any then unexpired and unvested equity awards (including, but not limited to, awards of stock appreciation rights or restricted stock units but excluding the award of performance-based restricted stock units granted to Executive on August 15, 2008, which instead will be subject to the terms of such grant, including without limitation the provisions regarding vesting following a change of control and in connection with certain terminations of employment) held by Executive based on the vesting that Executive would have achieved had Executive remained in the employ of the Company for an additional twelve (12) months. In addition, if the termination is by the Company without Cause or Executive resigns for Good Reason, Executive will be entitled to the amounts and benefits specified in Section 7.
Termination of Employment
     7. .
Severance
          (a) . If Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or if Executive resigns for Good Reason, and such termination is not in Connection with a Change of Control, then, subject to Section 8 and Section 7(d) below, Executive will receive: (i) in a lump sum payment on the sixty-first (61st) day following Executive's termination of employment: (A) an amount equal to twenty-four (24) months of Executive's Base Salary (subject to applicable tax withholdings); and (B) an amount equal to the current year's Target Annual Incentive pro-rated to the date of termination, with such pro-rated amount to be calculated by multiplying the current year's Target Annual Incentive by a fraction with a numerator equal to the number of days inclusive between the start of the current calendar year and the date of termination and a denominator equal to 365; (ii) twelve (12) months accelerated vesting with respect to Executive's then outstanding, unvested equity awards (other than the award of performance-based restricted stock units granted to Executive on August 15, 2008, which instead will be subject to the terms of such grant, including without limitation the
Termination Without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason other than in Connection with a Change of Control
 
provisions regarding vesting following a change of control and in connection with certain terminations of employment); and (iii) reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits for Executive (and any eligible dependents) under the Company's health plans until the earlier of (A) eighteen (18) months, payable when such premiums are due (provided Executive validly elects to continue coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ("COBRA")), or (B) the date upon which Executive and Executive's eligible dependents become covered under similar plans.
          (b) . If Executive's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason, and the termination is in Connection with a Change of Control, then, subject to Section 8 and Section 7(d) below, Executive will receive: (i) in a lump sum payment on the ninety-sixth (96th) day following Executive's termination of employment: (A) an amount equal to twenty-four (24) months of Executive's Base Salary for the year in which the termination occurs (subject to applicable tax withholdings); and (B) an amount equal to 100% of Executive's Target Annual Incentive for the year in which the termination occurs (subject to applicable tax withholdings); (ii) an amount equal to the current year's Target Annual Incentive pro-rated to the date of termination, with such pro-rated amount to be calculated by multiplying the current year's Target Annual Incentive by a fraction with a numerator equal to the number of days inclusive between the start of the current calendar year and the date of termination and a denominator equal to 365; (iii) 100% of Executive's then outstanding unvested equity awards (other than the award of performance-based restricted stock units granted to Executive on August 15, 2008, which instead will be subject to the terms of such grant, including without limitation the provisions regarding vesting following a change of control and in connection with certain terminations of employment) will vest, (iv) reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits for Executive (and any eligible dependents) under the Company's health plans until the earlier of (A) eighteen (18) months, payable when such premiums are due (provided Executive validly elects to continue coverage under COBRA), or (B) the date upon which Executive and Executive's eligible dependents become covered under similar plans, and (v) transitional outplacement benefits in accordance with the policies and guidelines of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control.
Termination Without Cause or Resignation for Good Reason in Connection with a Change of Control
          (c) .

Voluntary Termination Without Good Reason or Termination for Cause
          (d) .
Code Section 409A
               (i) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits (as defined below) or other
Six-Month Delay
 
severance benefits that otherwise are exempt from Section 409A (as defined below) pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9) will be considered due or payable until Executive has a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the final regulations and any guidance promulgated thereunder ("Section 409A"). Further, if Executive is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of his separation from service (other than due to death), then the severance benefits payable to Executive under this Agreement that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A, if any, and any other severance payments or separation benefits that are considered deferred compensation under Section 409A, if any (together, the "Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits") otherwise due to Executive on or within the six (6) month period following his separation from service will accrue during such six (6) month period and will become payable in a lump sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) on the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of Executive's separation from service. All subsequent payments of Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits, if any, will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit. For purposes of clarity, the following severance benefits shall not constitute Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits: (A) the vesting acceleration of outstanding awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights or restricted stock described in Sections 7(a)(iii) and 7(b)(iv) unless such awards include deferral or other features that cause such awards to be subject to Section 409A; and (B) the COBRA reimbursements described in Sections 7(a)(iv) and 7(b)(v). If Executive dies following his separation from service but prior to the six (6) month anniversary of his date of separation, then any payments delayed in accordance with this paragraph will be payable in a lump sum (less applicable withholding taxes) to Executive's estate as soon as administratively practicable after the date of his death and all other Deferred Compensation Separation Benefits will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit.
               (ii) . It is the intent of this Agreement to comply with the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the severance payments and benefits to be provided hereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities herein will be interpreted to so comply. Executive and the Company agree to work together in good faith to consider amendments to this Agreement and to take such reasonable actions which are necessary, appropriate or desirable to avoid imposition of any additional tax or income recognition under Section 409A prior to actual payment to Executive.
Amendments to this Agreement to Comply with Section 409A
     8. .
Conditions to Receipt of Severance; No Duty to Mitigate
          (a) . The receipt of any severance or other benefits pursuant to Section 7 will be subject to Executive signing and not revoking a separation agreement and release of claims in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. The separation agreement and release of claims must be executed and effective within the period required by the release but in no event later than the scheduled payment date set forth in Section 7(a)(i) or Section 7(a)(ii), as applicable. No severance or other benefits pursuant to Section 7 will be paid or provided until the separation agreement and release agreement becomes effective.
Separation Agreement and Release of Claims
 
          (b) . The receipt of any severance or other benefits pursuant to Section 7 will be subject to Executive agreeing that during the Employment Term and Continuance Period, Executive will not (i) solicit any employee of the Company (other than Executive's personal assistant) for employment other than at the Company, or (ii) directly or indirectly engage in, have any ownership interest in or participate in any entity that as of the date of termination, competes with the Company in any substantial business of the Company or any business reasonably expected to become a substantial business of the Company within the Continuance Period. If Executive violates this Section 8(b), the Company's sole recourse will be as follows: (x) the Executive shall repay to the Company an amount equal to (1) the after-tax proceeds of cash severance benefits paid to Executive pursuant to Section 7 of this Agreement multiplied by (2) the percentage determined by dividing the number of days that remain in the Continuance Period as of the date Executive violates this Section 8(b) by 730; and (y) the Company will be permitted to terminate any future reimbursements for premiums to be paid for continued health benefits pursuant to Sections 7(a)(iii) or 7(b)(iv). Executive's passive ownership of not more than 1% of any publicly traded company and/or 5% ownership of any privately held company will not constitute a breach of this Section 8(b). Public solicitation, such as by taking out ads in a newspaper, advertising on the web and the like, not specifically aimed at employees of the Company, will not constitute a breach of this Section 8(b).
Non-solicitation and Non-competition
          (c) . During the Employment Term and Continuance Period, Executive and the Company in its official communications will not knowingly and materially disparage, criticize, or otherwise make any derogatory statements regarding the other. The Company will instruct its officers and directors to not knowingly and materially disparage, criticize, or otherwise make any derogatory statements regarding Executive. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this agreement will be deemed to restrict Executive, the Company or any of the Company's current or former officers and/or directors from providing factual information to any governmental or regulatory agency (or in any way limit the content of any such information) to the extent they are requested or required to provide such information pursuant to applicable law or regulation.
Nondisparagement
          (d) . Executive's receipt of continued severance payments pursuant to Section 7 will be subject to Executive continuing to comply with the terms of the Confidential Information Agreement and the provisions of this Section 8.
Other Requirements
          (e) . Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor will any earnings that Executive may receive from any other source reduce any such payment.
No Duty to Mitigate
     9. . In the event that the benefits provided for in this Agreement constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and will be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then Executive's severance benefits payable under the terms of this Agreement will be either (a) delivered in full, or (b) delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such severance benefits being subject to the Excise Tax, whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of severance benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such severance benefits
Excise Tax
 
may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code. Unless Executive and the Company agree otherwise in writing, the determination of Executive's Excise Tax liability, if any, and the amount, if any, required to be paid under this Section 9 will be made in writing by the Company's independent tax accountants immediately prior to the Change of Control (the "Accountants"). In the event of a reduction in accordance with this paragraph (as described in (b) above), the reduction will occur, with respect to the benefits provided in this Agreement that are considered "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, in accordance with the following:
          (a) . Each payment will be assigned an "Economic Value" and a "280G Value." The 280G Value will equal the value of the payment for purposes of Section 280G of the Code as determined by the Accountants in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. The Economic Value will be determined as follows:
Assignment of Values
               (i) . The Economic Value of cash payments will equal the 280G Value of each such payment.
Cash payments
               (ii) .
Equity awards
                    (1) Options and Stock Appreciation Rights. The Economic Value of a Share (as defined below) subject to a stock option or stock appreciation right will be the difference equal to (A) the fair market value of such Share as of the date the 280G Value of the Share is determined for purposes of this Section, minus (B) the per share exercise price of the award.
                    (2) Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. The Economic Value of a Share subject to a restricted stock or restricted stock unit award will be the difference equal to (A) the fair market value of such Share as of the date the 280G Value of the Share is determined for purposes of this Section, less (B) the per share purchase price of the award, if any.
                    (3) For purposes of this Section 9, each share of common stock subject to each stock option, stock appreciation right, restricted stock award and restricted stock unit award, the payment or vesting acceleration of which constitutes a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code (a "Share"), will be a separate "payment." As a result, an Economic Value, 280G Value, and 280G Ratio (as defined below) will be determined for each Share. For purposes of illustration only, assume that Executive is granted an option on January 1, 2008, covering 500 Shares at a per share exercise price of $5. The option is scheduled to vest in equal annual installments of 250 Shares on January 1, 2010 and January 1, 2011. However, if a change of control occurs and Executive is terminated without cause, Executive is entitled to 100% vesting acceleration. On March 1, 2009, a change of control occurs with a deal price of $10 and Executive is terminated without cause. The Accountants determine that Executive's severance benefits should be reduced in accordance with this Section 9 and that the amount of the 280G Value to be reduced is $100. The Accountants determine that the Economic Value, 280G Value, and 280G Ratio for each of the 500 Shares subject to the option are as follows:
 
                         a) The Economic Value for each Share is $5 (i.e., $10 deal price less the $5 per share exercise price).
                         b) The 280G Value of each Share that would have vested on January 1, 2010 (the "2010 Shares"), is $1, as determined by the Accountants based on appropriate assumptions used in calculating the 280G Value in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.
                         c) The 280G Value of each Share that would have vested on January 1, 2011 (the "2011 Shares"), is $2, as determined by the Accountants based on appropriate assumptions used in calculating the 280G Value in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations.
                         d) The 280G Ratio of each 2010 Share is 5:1 (i.e., $5 Economic Value divided by the $1 280G Value).
                         e) The 280G Ratio of each 2011 Share is 5:2 (.i.e., the $5 Economic Value divided by the $2 280G Value).
                         The 280G Ratio of a 2011 Share is lower than the 280G Ratio of a 2010 Share. Consequently, the Accountants will reduce the 2011 Shares first. As each 2011 Share has a 280G Value of $2, the Accountants must reduce the 2011 Shares by 50 Shares (i.e., reducing the 2011 Shares by 50 Shares will reduce the Employee's aggregate 280G Value by $100 (50 Shares multiplied by $2). After taking the reduction into account, Executive vests in a total of 450 Shares (i.e., 250 Shares that would have vested on January 1, 2010 and 200 Shares that would have vested on January 1, 2011).
               (iii) . The Economic Value of each payment attributable to reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits under the Company's health plans will equal the 280G Value of each payment, such that the 280G Ratio for each such payment will be equal to one (1).
Other Benefits and Payments
          (b) . After the 280G Value and Economic Value of each payment are determined, the Accountants will rank the payments in order of increasing 280G Ratio as follows: the payment with the lowest 280G Ratio will be ranked first and all other payments will be ranked in ascending order with respect to their 280G Ratios with the payment with the highest 280G Ratio ranked last. For this purpose, the "280G Ratio" will mean, with respect to each payment, the ratio determined by dividing: (1) the Economic Value of the payment by (2) the 280G Value of the payment. For purposes of clarity, the Accountants will determine a separate 280G Ratio for each Share.
Ranking of Payments
          (c) . The portion of each payment that is a parachute payment under Section 280G of the Code will be reduced in the order in which the payments have been ranked in accordance with Section 9(b) above. For purposes of clarity, a Share or the acceleration of a Share, as applicable, may be reduced in whole Shares only and may not be reduced by a fraction of such Share. In the event that two or more payments have the same 280G Ratio, the portion of each payment that is a parachute payment will be reduced in accordance with the following rules:
Reduction of Parachute Payments
 
               (i) .
Cash Payments
                    (1) With respect to two or more cash payments that have the same 280G Ratio, such payments will be reduced on a pro-rata basis.
                    (2) Any cash payments that have the same 280G Ratio as payments that are not cash payments will be reduced prior to reducing the payments that are not cash payments.
               (ii) .
Equity Awards
                    (1) With respect to two or more Shares, if the Shares have the same 280G Ratio, the order of reduction of such Shares will be based on the 280G Value of the Shares. Shares with a higher 280G Value will be subject to earlier reduction, such that a Share with the highest 280G Value will be reduced first and a Share with the lowest 280G Value will be reduced last.
                    (2) In the event that two or more Shares (A) have the same 280G Ratio and (B) have the same 280G Value, the Shares will be subject to reduction based on the dates of grant of the equity awards covering such Shares. Shares subject to equity awards granted earlier will be subject to earlier reduction, such that a Share subject to an equity award with the earliest grant date will be reduced first and a Share subject to an equity award with the most recent grant date will be reduced last. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any one or more Shares subject to one or more nonstatutory stock options have the same 280G Ratio as any one or more Shares subject to one or more incentive stock options, Shares subject to incentive stock options will be subject to reduction only after Shares subject to nonstatutory stock options with the same 280G Ratio have been reduced in full.
                    (3) Any Shares that have the same 280G Ratio as payments attributable to reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits under the Company's health plans will be reduced prior to any such other payments having the same 280G Ratio that are neither cash nor Shares, provided that cash payments and Shares with the same 280G Ratio have been reduced in full.
               (iii) Other Benefits and Payments. With respect to two or more payments that: (A) have the same 280G Ratio and (B) are payments attributable to reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits under the Company's health plans such payments will be subject to pro rata reduction, provided that cash payments and Shares with the same 280G Ratio have been reduced in full.
          For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 9, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. Executive and the Company agree to furnish such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 9. The Company will bear all costs the Accountants may incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 9.
 
     10. .
Definitions
          (a) . For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" will mean:
Cause
               (i) Executive's willful and continued failure to perform the duties and responsibilities of his position after there has been delivered to Executive a written demand for performance from the Board which describes the basis for the Board's belief that Executive has not substantially performed his duties and Executive has not taken corrective action within thirty (30) days of such written demand;
               (ii) Any act of personal dishonesty taken by Executive in connection with his responsibilities as an employee of the Company with the intention or reasonable expectation that such action may result in the substantial personal enrichment of Executive;
               (iii) Executive's conviction of, or plea of nolo contendere to, a felony that the Board reasonably believes has had or will have a material detrimental effect on the Company's reputation or business;

               (vii) Executive's disqualification or bar by any governmental or self-regulatory authority from serving in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement or Executive's loss of any governmental or self-regulatory license that is reasonably necessary for Executive to perform his responsibilities to the Company under this Agreement, if (A) the disqualification, bar or loss continues for more than thirty (30) days, and (B) during that period the Company uses its good faith efforts to cause the disqualification or bar to be lifted or the license replaced. While any disqualification, bar or loss continues during Executive's employment, Executive will serve in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement to whatever extent legally permissible and, if Executive's employment is not permissible, Executive will be placed on leave (which will be paid to the extent legally permissible).

               (ii) The approval by the stockholders of the Company, or if stockholder approval is not required, approval by the Board, of a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a one-time reduction that (A) also is applied to substantially all other executive officers of the Company, or, following a Change of Control, substantially all other executive officers of the consolidated
 
entity that includes the Company, and (B) reduces the level of employee benefits by a percentage reduction of 10% or less will not constitute "Good Reason";
               (iii) A reduction in Executive's Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive as in effect immediately prior to such reduction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a one-time reduction that (A) also is applied to substantially all other executive officers of the Company, or, following a Change of Control, substantially all other executive officers of the consolidated entity that includes the Company, and (B) reduces Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive by a percentage reduction of 10% or less in the aggregate will not constitute "Good Reason";
               (iv) The relocation of Executive to a facility or location more than twenty-five (25) miles from the location of the Company's executive offices as of August 6, 2006;
               (v) Any material breach by the Company of any material contractual obligation owed Executive which breach is not remedied within thirty (30) days of written notice; or
               (vi) The failure of the Company to obtain the assumption of this Agreement by a successor.
The failure of the Company's stockholders to elect or reelect Executive to the Board will not constitute "Good Reason" for purposes of this Agreement.
          (f) . For purposes of this Agreement, a termination of Executive's employment with the Company is "in Connection with a Change of Control" if Executive's employment is terminated within three (3) months prior or twelve (12) months following a Change of Control. If a Change of Control event described in Section 10(b)(iv) occurs and, within twelve (12) months following such Change of Control, a Change of Control event described in Section 10(b)(i) through Section 10(b)(iii) occurs (the "Subsequent Change of Control"), a termination of Executive's employment with the Company also will be considered "in Connection with a Change of Control" if Executive's employment is terminated within twelve (12) months following the Subsequent Change of Control.
In Connection with a Change of Control
 
     11. . Subject to applicable law, Executive will be provided indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, including, if applicable, any directors and officers insurance policies, with such indemnification to be on terms determined by the Board or any of its committees, but on terms no less favorable than provided to any other Company executive officer or director and subject to the terms of any separate written indemnification agreement.
Indemnification
     12. . Executive will execute the form of Employment, Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, appended hereto as (the "Confidential Information Agreement"). In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the Confidential Information Agreement, this Agreement will prevail.
Confidential Information
Exhibit A
     13. . This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of (a) the heirs, executors and legal representatives of Executive upon Executive's death, and (b) any successor of the Company. Any such successor of the Company will be deemed substituted for the Company under the terms of this Agreement for all purposes. For this purpose, "successor" means any person, firm, corporation, or other business entity which at any time, whether by purchase, merger, or otherwise, directly or indirectly acquires all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company. None of the rights of Executive to receive any form of compensation payable pursuant to this Agreement may be assigned or transferred except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any other attempted assignment, transfer, conveyance, or other disposition of Executive's right to compensation or other benefits will be null and void. This Section 13 will in no way prevent Executive from transferring any vested property he owns.
Assignment
     14. . All notices, requests, demands and other communications called for hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed given (a) on the date of delivery if delivered personally; (b) one (1) day after being sent overnight by a well-established commercial overnight service, or (c) four (4) days after being mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, prepaid and addressed to the parties or their successors at the following addresses, or at such other addresses as the parties may later designate in writing:

     15. . If any provision hereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, unenforceable, or void, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect without said provision.
Severability
     16. . The parties agree that any and all disputes arising out of the terms of this Agreement, Executive's employment by the Company, Executive's service as an officer or director of the Company, or Executive's compensation and benefits, their interpretation and any of the matters herein released, will be subject to binding arbitration. In the event of a dispute, the parties (or their legal representatives) will promptly confer to select a single Arbitrator mutually acceptable to both parties. If the parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then the moving party may file a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in Santa Clara County, California, who will be selected and appointed consistent with the AAA-Employment Dispute Resolution Rules. Any arbitration will be conducted in a manner consistent with AAA National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes, supplemented by the California Rules of Civil Procedure. The Parties further agree that the prevailing party in any arbitration will be entitled to injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award. The parties hereby agree to waive their right to have any dispute between them resolved in a court of law by a judge or jury. This paragraph will not prevent either party from seeking injunctive relief (or any other provisional remedy) from any court having jurisdiction over the Parties and the subject matter of their dispute relating to Executive's obligations under this Agreement and the Confidential Information Agreement.
Arbitration
     17. . The Company will reimburse Executive for reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by him in connection with the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement. Also, in the event that, on or following a Change of Control that is triggered by an occurrence described in Section 10(b)(iii) that is not approved by the Board or an occurrence described in Section 10(b)(iv), either party brings an action to enforce or effect its rights under this Agreement, the Company will reimburse the Executive for his costs and expenses incurred in connection with the action (including, without limitation, in connection with Executive defending himself against an action brought by the Company to enforce or effects its rights under this Agreement), including the costs of mediation, arbitration, litigation, court fees, and reasonable attorneys' fees. Notwithstanding the preceding, no reimbursement will be made to Executive for an action originally brought by Executive if an entity of competent jurisdiction issues a final order that Executive's action was frivolous. This right to reimbursement will be subject to the following additional requirements: (i) Executive must submit documentation of the costs, expenses and fees to be reimbursed within thirty (30) days of the end of his taxable year in which the costs, expenses and fees were incurred; (ii) the amount of any reimbursement provided during his taxable year shall not affect any expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year; (iii) the reimbursement of eligible costs and expenses shall be made by the Company within thirty (30) days of Executive's submission of documentation of the costs, expenses and fees to be reimbursed but no later than the last day of Executive's taxable year that immediately follows the taxable year in which the costs or expenses were incurred; and (iv) the right to any such reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit or payment.
Legal Expenses
     18. . This Agreement, together with the Confidential Information Agreement, the forms of equity award agreements that describe Executive's outstanding equity awards (other

Waiver of Breach
     20. . The Confidential Information Agreement and the Company's and Executive's responsibilities under Sections 3(c), 6, 7, 8 and 11 will survive the termination of this Agreement.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On February 4, 2009, Atmel Corporation ("Atmel" or the "Company") issued a press release discussing its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2008. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
.
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2008.
SAN JOSE, CA, February 4, 2009
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $334.6 million, a 16.3% decrease compared to $400.0 million for the third quarter of 2008 and a 21.4% decrease compared to $425.6 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007. Revenues for the full year 2008 were $1.57 billion compared to $1.64 billion for 2007 and were impacted by the slowdown in demand, particularly of non-volatile memory and automotive product shipments in the fourth quarter. During 2008, Atmel exited the RF-CDMA foundry business which resulted in a revenue decline of approximately $50 million from 2007. Our core Microcontroller business continued to experience double-digit revenue growth, rising 14% in 2008, compared to 2007, with 32-bit microcontrollers growing 30%.
Net loss, on a GAAP basis, for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $(24.4) million or $(0.05) per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $(4.7) million or $(0.01) per diluted share for the third quarter of 2008 and net income of $1.7 million or $0.00 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. Net loss for the full year 2008 was $(27.2) million or $(0.06) per diluted share compared to net income of $47.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share for 2007.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $4.8 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared to net income of $42.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2008 and $19.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2008, non-GAAP net income was $78.0 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to $77.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share for 2007.
"The actions we have taken to focus on core technologies and optimize Atmel's manufacturing operations have supported the microcontroller revenue growth and gross profit improvement we realized this year, despite the
 
challenging macroeconomic environment," said Steven Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "While the global recessionary slowdown is impacting demand across the entire semiconductor industry, Atmel continues to gain market share with its microcontroller products driven by our proprietary AVR Flash-based MCUs. Having initiated our restructuring program ahead of the global downturn, Atmel is well positioned to drive profitable growth as demand recovers, while continuing to deliver innovative products to our customers and value to our shareholders."
Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, was 39.7% for the fourth quarter of 2008, the highest level achieved since the first quarter of 2001. This compares to gross profit of 39.5% for the third quarter of 2008 and 35.2% for the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2008, gross profit was 37.7%, a 230 basis points improvement over the 35.4% reported for 2007.
Operating loss was $(18.2) million for the fourth quarter of 2008, or 5.5% of revenue. This compares to an operating loss of $(11.3) million for the third quarter of 2008 and an operating profit of $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in the fourth quarter 2008 operating loss was $12.2 million of net charges related to restructuring, gain on sale of assets, acquisition and grant repayments.
For the full year 2008, operating loss was $(13.9) million, compared to operating profit of $51.7 million reported for 2007. Included in the full year operating results were net charges of $71.0 million for 2008 and $13.6 million for 2007, respectively, related to restructuring, asset impairment, acquisition, gain on sale of assets and grant repayments.
Stock-based compensation expense was $9.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, compared to $7.4 million for the third quarter of 2008 and $5.1 million for the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2008, stock-based compensation was $29.1 million, compared to $16.7 million for the full year 2007.
Income tax provision was $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. This compares to an income tax benefit of $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2008 and an income tax provision of $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008, the income tax provision was $7.0 million, compared to $7.8 million for 2007.
Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $440.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of $19.7 million from the end of the prior quarter and an increase of $10.7 million from the fourth quarter of 2007. Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $30.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $67.2 million for the third quarter of 2008 and $90.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2007.
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 was approximately $1.35 to the euro, compared to $1.54 to the euro in the third quarter of 2008 and $1.43 to the euro in the year-ago period. A
 
$0.01 decrease in the dollar/euro exchange rate increases operating income by approximately $0.5 million each quarter.
Fourth Quarter 2008 and Recent Operational Highlights
Recent Product Highlights
Business Outlook
In light of the uncertainty and limited visibility in the current macroeconomic environment, the Company is not providing revenue guidance at this time. For internal purposes, we are planning first quarter 2009 revenues to be approximately $290 million.
Non-GAAP
Non-GAAP net income excludes charges related to restructuring activities, acquisitions, grant repayments, asset impairment charges (recovery), gain on sale of assets, and stock-based compensation, as well as pension benefit related to fab sale, distributor bad debt expense, unsolicited M&A expense and the income tax effect of these excluded items. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included following the financial statements below.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net (Loss) Income to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
 
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Atmel classifies assets as held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when the decision is made to sell the asset. The Company then records an impairment charge (recovery) as the difference between the fair value, less any selling costs, and the carrying value. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Pension benefit related to the reduction of pension liability and the release of related accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Heilbronn, Germany. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Distributor bad debt expense related to a reserve for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the Company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
The Company incurred certain expenses to advise the Company against the take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.

date on which the corporation first mailed its proxy statement to stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the later of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of such annual meeting or ten (10) calendar days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the meeting is first made. To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to the secretary shall set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of the stockholder in such business, and (v) any other information that is required to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), in his capacity as a proponent to a stockholder proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act. Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (b). The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted.
          (c) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as directors. Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the corporation may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the board of directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). Such nominations, other than those made by or at the direction of the board of directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.2. At the request of the board of directors, any person nominated by a stockholder for election as a director shall furnish to the secretary of the corporation that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the nominee. No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c). The chairman of the meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a nomination was not made in accordance with the
 
procedures prescribed by these Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.
     . A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board, by the chairman of the board or by the president, but a special meeting may not be called by any other person or persons. Only such business shall be considered at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been stated in the notice for such meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Whole Board. A special meeting of the stockholders may be cancelled, postponed or rescheduled at any time, before or after the notice for such meeting has been sent to the stockholders, by the board of directors acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board. For purposes of these Bylaws, the term "Whole Board" shall mean the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships.
2.3
Special Meeting
     . All notices of meetings of stockholders shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these Bylaws not less than ten (10) (or, if sent by third-class mail pursuant to Section 2.5 of these Bylaws, thirty (30)) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting. The notice shall specify the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and (i) in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called (no business other than that specified in the notice may be transacted) or (ii) in the case of the annual meeting, those matters which the board of directors, at the time of giving the notice, intends to present for action by the stockholders (but any proper matter may be presented at the meeting for such action). The notice of any meeting at which directors are to be elected shall include the name of any nominee or nominees who, at the time of the notice, the board intends to present for election.

Written notice of any meeting of stockholders shall be given either (i) personally, (ii) by private courier, (iii) by first- or third-class United States mail, (iv) by other written communication or (v) by other electronic or wireless means. Notices not personally delivered shall be sent charges prepaid and shall be addressed to the stockholder at the address of that stockholder appearing on the books of the corporation or given by the stockholder to the corporation for the purpose of notice. Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time when delivered personally or by courier or deposited in the mail or sent by other means of written communication or other electronic or wireless means.
2.5
Manner Of Giving Notice; Affidavit Of Notice
     An affidavit of the mailing or other means of giving any notice of any stockholders' meeting, executed by the secretary, assistant secretary or any transfer agent of the corporation giving the notice, shall be prima facie evidence of the giving of such notice.
     . The holders of a majority in voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (i) the chairman of the meeting or (ii) the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting in accordance with Section 2.7 of these Bylaws.
2.6
Quorum
 
     When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the laws of the State of Delaware or of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of the question.
     If a quorum is initially present, the stockholders may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken is approved by a majority of the stockholders initially constituting the quorum.
     . Whether or not a quorum is present at a meeting of stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time to another time or place or means of remote communications, without notice other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting. When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, unless these Bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any, and the means of remote communications, if any, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.
2.7

     . The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.11 of these Bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners, and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).
2.8
Voting
     Except as may be otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder.
     . The transactions of any meeting of stockholders, either annual or special, however called and noticed, and wherever held, shall be as valid as though they had been taken at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum be present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the meeting, each person entitled to vote, who was not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice or a consent to the holding of the meeting or an approval of the minutes thereof. The waiver of notice or consent or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of any annual or special meeting of stockholders. All such waivers, consents, and approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
2.9
Validation Of Meetings; Waiver Of Notice; Consent
     Attendance by a person at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting, except when the person objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
     . Subject to the rights of the holders of the shares of any series of Preferred Stock or any other class of stock or series thereof having a preference over the

Common Stock as dividend or upon liquidation, the stockholders of the corporation may not take action by written consent without a meeting but must take any such actions at a duly called annual or special meeting.
     . For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting or to vote thereat, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the board of directors and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the date of any such meeting, and in such event only stockholders of record on the date so fixed are entitled to notice and to vote, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date, except as otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, by these Bylaws, by agreement or by applicable law.
2.11
Record Date For Stockholder Notice; Voting
     If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.
     A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting unless the board of directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting, but the board of directors shall fix a new record date if the meeting is adjourned for more than thirty (30) days from the date set for the original meeting.
     The record date for any other purpose shall be as provided in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws.
     . Every person entitled to vote for directors, or on any other matter, shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy signed by the person and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission, facsimile or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to the irrevocability of proxies).

Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the corporation's principal executive office. In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders and of the number of shares held by each such stockholder.
     . Before any meeting of stockholders, the board of directors may appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting or its adjournment. If no inspector of election is so appointed, then the chairman of the meeting may, and on the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint an inspector or inspectors of election to act at the meeting. The number of inspectors shall be either one (1) or three (3). If inspectors are appointed at a meeting pursuant to the request of one (1) or more stockholders or proxies, then the holders of a majority of the voting power of shares or their proxies present at the meeting shall determine whether one (1) or three (3) inspectors are to be appointed. If any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, then the chairman of the meeting may, and upon the request of any stockholder or a stockholder's proxy shall, appoint a person to fill that vacancy.
2.15
Inspectors Of Election
          Such inspectors shall:
          (a) determine the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the number of shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies;
          (b) receive votes, ballots or consents;
          (c) hear and determine all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the right to vote;
          (d) count and tabulate all votes or consents;

Election And Term Of Office Of Directors
          (a) Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these Bylaws, at each annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the corporation shall be elected to hold office until the expiration of the term for which they are elected, and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified; except that if any such election shall not be so held, such election shall take place at a stockholders' meeting called and held in accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware. The term of office of a director shall begin immediately after election. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed.
          (b) Each director to be elected by stockholders shall be elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock to elect directors in accordance with the terms thereof. For purposes of this bylaw, a majority of votes cast shall mean that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Votes cast shall include votes to withhold authority in each case and exclude abstentions with respect to that director's election. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a contested election of directors, directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. For purposes of this bylaw, a contested election shall mean any election of directors in which the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected.
          (c) If a nominee for director who is an incumbent director is not elected and no successor has been elected at such meeting, the director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the board of directors in accordance with the agreement to be executed by each such nominee as a condition of such nomination. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall make a recommendation to the board of directors as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board of directors shall act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the Commission or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in making its recommendation, and the board of directors in making its decision, may each consider any factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. The director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the decision of the board of directors with respect to his or her resignation. If such incumbent director's resignation is not accepted by the
 
board of directors, such director shall continue to serve until the end of his or her term and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the board of directors pursuant to this bylaw, or if a nominee for director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the board of directors, in its sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.4 or may decrease the size of the board of directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.2.
     . Any director may resign effective on giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary or the board of directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for that resignation to become effective. If the resignation of a director is effective at a future time, the board of directors may elect a successor to take office when the resignation becomes effective. Each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced and until a successor has been elected and qualified.

Each director so elected shall hold office until the expiration of the term of office of the director whom he has replaced and until a successor has been elected and qualified.
     Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws:
               (i) Vacancies, including vacancies from newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.
               (ii) Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies, including vacancies from newly created directorships, of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.
               (iii) If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, or may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to meetings of stockholders).
     If, at the time of filling any vacancy, including vacancies from any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders
 
holding at least ten (10%) percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies, including vacancies from newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to meetings of stockholders) as far as applicable.
     . Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, any director, directors or the entire board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is present shall

Administrative Officers shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to time may be determined by the president or the board of directors in order to assist the Corporate Officers in the furtherance of their duties. In the performance of such duties and the exercise of such powers, however, such Administrative Officers shall have limited authority to act on behalf of the corporation as the board of directors shall establish, including but not limited to limitations on the dollar amount and on the scope of agreements or commitments that may be made by such Administrative Officers on behalf of the corporation, which limitations may not be exceeded by such individuals or altered by the president without further approval by the board of directors.

For purposes of this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation shall mean any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
6.1
Indemnification Of Directors And Officers
     The corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in connection with an action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such director or officer only if the initiation of such action, suit, or proceeding (or part thereof) by the director or officer was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation.
     The corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorney's fees) incurred by a director or officer of the corporation entitled to indemnification hereunder in defending any action, suit or proceeding referred to in this Section 6.1 in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that payment of expenses incurred by a director or officer of the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall
 
be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the director or officer to repay all amounts advanced if it should ultimately be determined that the director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 6.1 or otherwise.
     The rights conferred on any person by this ARTICLE VI shall not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the corporation's Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, agreement, vote of the stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.
     Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this ARTICLE VI shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.
     . The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify any person (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, or proceeding, in which such person was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than a director or officer) shall mean any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.
6.2
Indemnification Of Others
     . The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
6.3
Insurance
     . The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by any director or officer in connection with such proceeding, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise; provided, however, that the corporation shall not be required to advance expenses to any director or officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless the proceeding was authorized in advance by the board of directors of the corporation.
6.4
Expenses
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to Section 6.5, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and
 
promptly made (i) by the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
     . The rights conferred on any person by this bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
6.5
Non-Exclusivity Of Rights
     . The rights conferred on any person by this bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
6.6
Survival Of Rights
     . Any repeal or modification of this bylaw shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this bylaw in effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.
6.7
Amendments
     . The corporation shall, either at its principal executive office or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these Bylaws as amended to date, accounting books and other records of its business and properties.
7.1
Maintenance And Inspection Of Records
     Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.
     . Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director.
7.2
Inspection By Directors
     . The chairman of the board, if any, the president, any vice president, the chief financial officer, the secretary or any assistant secretary of this
7.3
Representation Of Shares Of Other Corporations
 
corporation, or any other person authorized by the board of directors or the president or a vice president, is authorized to vote, represent and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of the stock of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation. The authority herein granted may be exercised either by such person directly or by any other person authorized to do so by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by such person having the authority.
     . The original or a copy of these Bylaws, as amended or otherwise altered to date, certified by the secretary, shall be kept at the corporation's principal executive office and shall be open to inspection by the stockholders of the corporation, at all reasonable times during office hours.
7.4
Certification And Inspection Of Bylaws
     . For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted and which shall not be more than sixty (60) days before any such action. In that case, only stockholders of record at the close of business on the date so fixed are entitled to receive the dividend, distribution or allotment of rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any shares on the books of the corporation after the record date so fixed, except as otherwise provided by law.
8.1
Record Date For Purposes Other Than Notice And Voting
     If the board of directors does not so fix a record date, then the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the applicable resolution.
     . From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.
8.2
Checks; Drafts; Evidences Of Indebtedness
     . The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these Bylaws, may authorize and empower any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such power and authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.
8.3
Corporate Contracts And Instruments: How Executed
     . The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of
8.4
Stock Certificates; Transfer; Partly Paid Shares
 
stock represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by, the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors, or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
     Certificates for shares shall be of such form and device as the board of directors may designate and shall state the name of the record holder of the shares represented thereby; its number; date of issuance; the number of shares for which it is issued; a summary statement or reference to the powers, designations, preferences or other special rights of such stock and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights, if any; a statement or summary of liens, if any; a conspicuous notice of restrictions upon transfer or registration of transfer, if any; a statement as to any applicable voting trust agreement; and, if the shares be assessable, or, if assessments are collectible by personal action, a plain statement of such facts.
     Upon surrender to the secretary or transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.
     The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.
     . If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware (relating to transfers of stock, stock certificates and uncertificated stock), in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.
8.5
Special Designation On Certificates
     . Except as provided in this Section 8.6, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The board of directors may, in case any share certificate or certificate for any other security is lost, stolen or destroyed, authorize the issuance of replacement certificates on such terms and conditions as
8.6
Lost Certificates
 
the board may require; the board may require indemnification of the corporation secured by a bond or other adequate security sufficient to protect the corporation against any claim that may be made against it, including any expense or liability, on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of the certificate or the issuance of the replacement certificate.
     . The board of directors may appoint one or more transfer agents or transfer clerks, and one or more registrars, each of which shall be an incorporated bank or trust company  either domestic or foreign, who shall be appointed at such times and places as the requirements of the corporation may necessitate and the board of directors may designate.
8.7
Transfer Agents And Registrars
     . Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions in the General Corporation Law of Delaware shall govern the construction of these Bylaws. Without limiting the generality of this provision, as used in these Bylaws, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term "person" includes both an entity and a natural person.
8.8
Construction; Definitions
     . All restrictions, limitations, requirements and other provisions of these Bylaws shall be construed, insofar as possible, as supplemental and additional to all provisions of law applicable to the subject matter thereof and shall be fully complied with in addition to the said provisions of law unless such compliance shall be illegal.
8.9
Provisions Additional to Provisions of Law
     . Any article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase of these Bylaws which upon being construed in the manner provided in Section 8.9 hereof, shall be contrary to or inconsistent with any applicable provisions of law, shall not apply so long as said provisions of law shall remain in effect, but such result shall not affect the validity or applicability of any other portions of these Bylaws, it being hereby declared that these Bylaws would have been adopted and each article, section, subsection, subdivision, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more articles, sections, subsections, subdivisions, sentences, clauses or phrases is or are illegal.
8.10
Provisions Contrary To Provisions Of Law
     . Any reference in these Bylaws to the time a notice is given or sent means, unless otherwise expressly provided, the time a written notice by mail is deposited in the United States mails, postage prepaid; or the time any other written notice is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a common carrier for transmission, or actually transmitted by the person giving the notice by electronic means, to the recipient; or the time any oral notice is communicated, in person or by telephone or wireless means, to the recipient or to a person at the office of the recipient who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the recipient.
8.11
Notices
     . Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders pursuant to the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given. Any
9.1
Notice by Electronic Transmission
 
such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if:
          (i) the corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the corporation in accordance with such consent; and
          (ii) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice.
     However, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
     Any notice given pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be deemed given:
          (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
          (ii) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice;
          (iii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and
          (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
     An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
     . An "electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.
9.2
Definition of Electronic Transmission
     . Notice by a form of electronic transmission shall not apply to Section 164 (relating to failure to pay for stock; remedies), Section 296 (relating to adjudication of claims; appeal), Section 311 (relating to revocation of voluntary dissolution), Section 312 (relating to renewal, revival, extension and restoration of certificate of incorporation) or Section 324 (relating to attachment of shares of stock or any option, right or interest therein) of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.
9.3
Inapplicability
     Subject to Section 6.7 hereof, the original or other Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its
 
Certificate of Incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
     Whenever an amendment or new bylaw is adopted, it shall be copied in the book of Bylaws with the original Bylaws in the appropriate place. If any bylaw is repealed, the fact of repeal with the date of the meeting at which the repeal was enacted or the filing of the operative written consent(s) shall be stated in said book.

.
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
SAN JOSE, CA, May 5, 2009
Revenues for the first quarter of 2009 were $271.5 million, an 18.9% decrease compared to $334.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and a 34.0% decrease compared to $411.2 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008.
Net income, on a GAAP basis, for the first quarter of 2009 totaled $3.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $(24.4) million or $(0.05) per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008 and net income of $6.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2009 totaled $20.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to net income of $4.8 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $13.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.
Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, was 35.1% for the first quarter of 2009 and within the internal expectations announced by the Company in February 2009. This compares to gross profit of 39.7% for the fourth quarter of 2008 and 35.5% for the year-ago quarter.
"We are pleased with the substantial progress we achieved in reducing operating costs this quarter, especially in light of the revenue softness," said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Although visibility remains limited, we are seeing signs that order patterns have stabilized as bookings in March showed signs of improvement."
Operating loss was $(20.5) million for the first quarter of 2009, or (7.6)% of revenue. This compares to an operating loss of $(18.2) million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and an operating profit of $15.4 million for the first
 
quarter of 2008. Included in the first quarter 2009 operating loss was $8.5 million of net charges related to acquisition, restructuring, grant repayments and gain on sale of assets.
Stock-based compensation expense was $5.4 million for the first quarter of 2009, compared to $9.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $6.3 million for the year-ago quarter.
Income tax benefit totaled $27.7 million for the first quarter of 2009. This compares to an income tax provision of $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $3.2 million for the first quarter of 2008. The income tax benefit for the first quarter of 2009 was the result of the release of reserves related to certain foreign R&D tax credits that the Company realized in the quarter.
Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $416.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2009, a decrease of $23.7 million from the end of the prior quarter. Not included in this balance is $17.2M of restricted cash required as a result of the lower borrowing base from our revolving line of credit. Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2009. This compares to $33.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and cash used in operations of $40.2 million for the first quarter of 2008.
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the first quarter of 2009 was approximately $1.32 to the euro, compared to $1.35 to the euro in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $1.47 to the euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 decrease in the dollar/euro exchange rate increases operating income by approximately $0.3 million each quarter.
First Quarter 2009 and Recent Operational Highlights
Recent Product Highlights
 
Business Outlook
Due to the current macroeconomic environment and limited visibility, the Company expects second quarter 2009 revenues will be up in the range of 1% to 4% on a sequential basis.
Non-GAAP
Non-GAAP net income excludes charges related to restructuring activities, acquisitions, grant repayments, gain on sale of assets, and stock-based compensation, as well as pension benefit related to fab sale, distributor bad debt expense (recovery), unsolicited M&A expense and the income tax effect of these excluded items. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included following the financial statements below.

Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP shares used in diluted income per share calculations:
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
 
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
 
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Pension benefit related to the reduction of pension liability and the release of related accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Heilbronn, Germany. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Distributor bad debt (recovery) expense related to a reserve and subsequent partial collection for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the Company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
The Company incurred certain expenses to advise the Company concerning the take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.

Multiple Administrative Bodies
 
(ii) .  To the extent that the Administrator determines it to be desirable to qualify Awards granted hereunder as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Plan shall be administered by a Committee of two or more "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. For purposes of qualifying grants of Awards as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee, in its discretion, may set restrictions based upon the achievement of Performance Goals. The Performance Goals shall be set by the Committee on or before the latest date permissible to enable the Awards to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code. In granting Awards that are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee shall follow any procedures determined by it from time to time to be necessary or appropriate to ensure qualification of the Awards under Section 162(m) of the Code (e.g., in determining the Performance Goals).

Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to, the exercise price, the time or times when Awards may be exercised (which may be based on performance criteria), any vesting acceleration or waiver of forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any Award or the Shares relating thereto, based in each case on such factors as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine;
 
(vi) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan and Awards granted pursuant to the Plan;
 
(vii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, including rules and regulations relating to sub-plans established for the purpose of satisfying applicable foreign laws;

(x)  to allow Optionees to satisfy withholding tax obligations by electing to have the Company withhold from the Shares to be issued upon exercise of an Award that number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld.

Eligibility
 
7.  .
Limitations
 
(a)  Each Option shall be designated in the Award Agreement as either an Incentive Stock Option or a Nonstatutory Stock Option. However, notwithstanding such designation, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Optionee during any calendar year (under all plans of the Company and any Parent or Subsidiary) exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Nonstatutory Stock Options. For purposes of this Section 7(a), Incentive Stock Options shall be taken into account in the order in which they were granted. The Fair Market Value of the Shares shall be determined as of the time the Option with respect to such Shares is granted.
 
(b)  Neither the Plan nor any Award shall confer upon an Optionee any right with respect to continuing the Optionee's relationship as a Service Provider with the Company, nor shall they interfere in any way with the Optionee's right or the Company's right to terminate such relationship at any time, with or without cause.
 
(c)  The following limitations shall apply to grants of Options, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Units:
 
(i)  No Service Provider shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company, Options, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units to purchase more than 5,000,000 Shares.

(iii) The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 16.
 
(iv) If an Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Unit is cancelled in the same fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 16), the cancelled Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Unit is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units and the grant of a new Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units.
 
8.  .  Subject to Section 22 of the Plan, the Plan shall become effective upon adoption by the Board and obtaining stockholder approval. The Plan amends and restates the previous 1996 Stock Plan. It shall continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless terminated earlier under Section 18 of the Plan.
Term of Plan

In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Optionee's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan.

In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Optionee's death. If, at the time of death, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan.

In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to any Shares purchased upon exercise of an Award shall lapse as to all such Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16(b) to the contrary, for Awards granted on or after August 14, 2008, that may be considered "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A, the payment of any Awards that accelerate in accordance with this Section 16(b) nevertheless will be made at the same time or times as if such Awards had vested in accordance with the vesting provisions applicable to such Awards unless otherwise determined by the Administrator.
Dissolution or Liquidation
 
(c)  .  For Awards granted prior to August 14, 2008, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. For Awards granted on or after August 14, 2008, in the event of (i) a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, other than a merger which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or its Parent) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity or its Parent outstanding immediately after such merger or (ii) the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Award (whether granted prior to, on or after August 14, 2008), the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse, and,
Merger or Asset Sale
 
with respect to Restricted Stock Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of 15 days from the date of such notice, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
For the purposes of this paragraph, the Award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Restricted Stock Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Restricted Stock Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Restricted Stock Units by the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the successor corporation's corporate structure post-merger or post-sale of assets will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
 
17. .  The Grant Date of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Optionee within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
Date of Grant
 
18. .
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
 
(a)  .  The Board may at any time amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Plan.
Amendment and Termination
 
(b)  .  The Company shall obtain shareholder approval of any Plan amendment to the extent necessary and desirable to comply with Applicable Laws, and to adopt material Plan amendments, including:
Shareholder Approval
 
(i)  A material increase in benefits accrued to Participants under the Plan;
 
(ii) An increase in the number of shares that may be optioned or sold under the Plan;
 
(iii) A material modification (expansion or reduction) of the class of participants in the Plan; or
 
(iv) A provision permitting the Administrator to lapse or waive restrictions on Awards at its discretion.
 
(c)  .  No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Optionee, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Optionee and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Optionee and the Company.
Effect of Amendment or Termination
 
Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.
 
19. .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
 
(a)  .  Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Award unless the exercise of such Award and the issuance and delivery of such Shares shall comply with Applicable Laws and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
Legal Compliance
 
(b)  .  As a condition to the exercise of an Award, the Company may require the person exercising such Award to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required.
Investment Representations
 
20. .  The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained.
Inability to Obtain Authority
 
21. .  The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan.
Reservation of Shares
 
22. .  The Plan shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted. Such shareholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
Shareholder Approval
 
23. .  The Administrator, may in its sole discretion, offer to each Optionee who holds an Option with an original Grant Date Exercise Price that was less than the original Grant Date fair market value, as determined for purposes of Section 409A, (each a "Discount Option") one or more of the following choices with respect to the portion of such Discount Option that was unvested on December 31, 2004 (such portion is referred to as the "Eligible Discount Option"):
Section 409A Exchange Offer
 
(a)  If Optionee exercised any Eligible Discount Option (or portion thereof) in 2006, then Optionee may elect to amend the eligible portion of each Eligible Discount Option such that the Exercise Price of the Option will be increased to the fair market value, as determined for purposes of Section 409A, of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Option's grant date.
 
(b)  If Optionee was granted an Eligible Discount Option, but did not exercise any Eligible Discount Option in 2006, then Optionee may be given one or more of the following choices:
 
(i)  Optionee may elect to amend each Eligible Discount Option to change the option expiration date identified in the original grant agreement to a date that is expected to constitute a fixed calendar year election for purposes of Section 409A (the Administrator will have the discretion to choose to allow Optionees to pick different calendar years for different portions of each Eligible Discount Option); and/or
 
(ii) Optionee may elect to amend the eligible portion of each Eligible Discount Option such that the Exercise Price of the Option will be increased to the fair market value, as determined for purposes of Section 409A, of a share of the Company's Common Stock on the Option's grant date.
 
24. .  The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may institute a one-time Option Exchange Program, commencing within 12 months following approval of such Option Exchange Program by the Company's stockholders, that permits each eligible Optionee who holds an Option with an Exercise Price per Share greater than the trailing 52-week high price of the Common Stock as of the commencement of the Option Exchange Program to elect to cancel such Option in exchange for a new Award issued under the Plan, as described in the proxy statement with respect to the Company's 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Amendment to Performance Restricted Stock Unit Agreements
     On May 28, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") adopted amendments to the performance restricted stock unit ("RSU") agreements for use under the Company's 2005 Stock Plan. The performance RSU agreements provide for the grant of a maximum number of RSUs that will be paid out in shares of the Company's common stock (the "performance shares") after the applicable operating margin performance criteria have been met. The amendments apply to currently outstanding performance shares, as well as performance shares that may be granted in the future. Pursuant to the amendments:
     . The performance RSU agreements provide for eighteen quarterly performance periods beginning July 1, 2008, and ending December 31, 2012.
Performance period
     . If a change of control (as such term is defined in the performance RSU agreements) occurs during the performance period, the performance period will be deemed to end immediately prior to the change of control, and up to 50% of the maximum number of performance shares subject to the performance RSU agreements (or a lesser amount if the recipient had previously vested in more than 50% of such maximum number) will convert to a time-based vesting schedule as specified in the performance RSU agreements.
Time-Based Vesting Following Change of Control
     . Generally, performance shares that have not vested by the time of a recipient's termination of service with the Company will be forfeited. However, the performance RSU agreements provide that in the event that, within three (3) months before or eighteen (18) months following a change in control, a recipient incurs a termination of service either (i) by the Company due to death,
Treatment Upon Termination Following Change of Control
Table of Contents
disability or any reason other than for cause (as such term is defined in the performance RSU agreements), or (ii) by the recipient for good reason (as such term is defined in the performance RSU agreements), then all then unvested shares subject to the performance RSU agreement will fully vest.
Amendment and Restatement of Employment Agreement
     On June 3, 2009, the Company and Steven Laub, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into an amendment and restatement (the "Amendment") of Mr. Laub's employment agreement with the Company dated as of August 6, 2006, as previously amended on March 13, 2007 and December 30, 2008 (the "Employment Agreement"). The Amendment, among other things, amends the severance benefits payable to Mr. Laub. Pursuant to the Amendment:
     If Mr. Laub's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or is due to death or disability or Mr. Laub resigns for good reason and such termination, death, disability or resignation is not in connection with a change of control, then Mr. Laub will receive: (i) a lump sum payment on the 96th day following termination of employment equal to (A) his base salary for 24 months and (B) 100% of his target annual incentive; (ii) 12 months of accelerated vesting with respect to his outstanding unvested equity awards (other than the award of performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Laub on August 15, 2008, which instead will be subject to the terms of such grant, including without limitation the provisions regarding vesting in connection with certain terminations of employment); and (iii) reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits for Mr. Laub and any eligible dependents under Atmel's health plans for up to 18 months, payable when such premiums are due.
     If Mr. Laub's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or is due to death or disability or Mr. Laub resigns for good reason, in each case within three months prior to or 18 months following a change of control, then Mr. Laub will receive: (i) a lump sum payment on the 96th day following termination of employment equal to (A) his base salary for 36 months and (B) 300% of his target annual incentive; (ii) accelerated vesting with respect to 100% of his then outstanding unvested equity awards (other than the award of performance-based restricted stock units granted to Mr. Laub on August 15, 2008, which instead will be subject to the terms of such grant, including without limitation the provisions regarding vesting following a change of control); (iii) reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits for Mr. Laub and any eligible dependents under Atmel's health plans for up to 18 months, payable when such premiums are due; and (iv) transitional outplacement benefits in accordance with the policies and guidelines of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the change of control.

Fiscal 2009 Executive Bonus Plan
     On June 17, 2009, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an executive bonus plan for fiscal year 2009. The executive bonus plan is a cash incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the Company's financial and other performance objectives, and to reward them for their achievements when those objectives are met. All of the Company's executive officers pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain other employees of the Company, are eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan (individually, a "Participant," and collectively, the "Participants"). Target bonuses for Participants range from 25% to 125% of a Participant's annual base salary, and the amount of the target bonus actually paid to a Participant will be based on the achievement of (i) certain Company performance objectives related to the Company's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit as compared to the Company's annual operating plan, (ii) certain individual performance objectives approved by the Compensation Committee, and (iii) for some Participants, certain business unit objectives tied to the business unit's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit, or certain objectives tied to sales region billings. Achievement of each such factor will be measured independently, and a threshold for each factor must be met for any credit to be given to that factor. Awards will be prorated between threshold and target performance and target and stretch performance. The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2009, if any, could range from zero to 200% of a Participant's bonus target and will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce or increase the bonus that would otherwise be payable based on actual performance. However, no bonuses will be paid under the executive bonus plan if the Company does not achieve an annual non-GAAP operating profit (excluding the impact of items such as stock-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairment changes, certain acquisition-related charges and certain legal and accounting expenses). In addition, no credit will be applied to the business unit non-GAAP operating profit factor if the business unit does not achieve an annual non-GAAP operating profit (excluding the items mentioned in the previous sentence). The aggregate amount of bonuses payable under the executive bonus plan to Participants is approximately $4.9 million at target performance; the aggregate maximum amount of bonuses payable to Participants is approximately $9.8 million.

Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
On August 3, 2009, Atmel Corporation ("Atmel" or the "Company") issued a press release discussing its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009. The press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
This information shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

.
(d) Exhibits
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009.
SAN JOSE, CA, August 3, 2009
Revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were $285 million, a 5% increase compared to $272 million for the first quarter of 2009, and a 32% decrease compared to $421 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Net loss, on a GAAP basis, for the second quarter of 2009 totaled $(12.4) million or $(0.03) per diluted share. This compares to net income of $3.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2009 and a net loss of $(4.9) million or $(0.01) per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.
Non-GAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2009 totaled $(0.6) million or $(0.00) per diluted share compared to net income of $20.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2009, and $17.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.
Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, was 32.3% for the second quarter of 2009. This compares to gross profit of 35.1% for the first quarter of 2009 and 36.5% for the year-ago quarter. During the second quarter, gross profit was impacted by a planned reduction in factory utilization at the Company's two wafer fabrication facilities.
"We are encouraged by order patterns that are beginning to normalize across all product lines," said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are also pleased to have exceeded the upper end of our revenue guidance range this quarter despite the challenging macro environment. Although visibility remains limited, Atmel is well positioned with its leading product portfolio to capitalize on the improving global semiconductor market."
Loss from operations was $(17.6) million for the second quarter of 2009, or (6)% of revenue. This compares to a loss from operations of $(20.5) million for the first quarter of 2009 and income from operations of $0.2 million
 
for the second quarter of 2008. Included in the second quarter 2009 loss from operations was $6.4 million of net charges related to acquisition, restructuring and grant repayments.
Stock-based compensation expense was $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2009, compared to $5.4 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $6.4 million for the year-ago quarter.
Income tax benefit totaled $9.7 million for the second quarter of 2009. This compares to an income tax benefit of $27.7 million for the first quarter of 2009 and a provision of $4.3 million for the second quarter of 2008. The income tax benefit for the second quarter of 2009 was the result of R&D tax credits generated in the current year as well as the reversal of tax liabilities no longer needed as a result of settlement of certain foreign tax audits.
Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $419.4 million at the end of the second quarter of 2009, an increase of $2.5 million from the end of the prior quarter. During the quarter, the Company repaid $20 million of its revolving credit facility, eliminating the restricted cash balance of $17.3 million reported in the previous quarter. Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2009. This compares to $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $50.4 million for the second quarter of 2008.
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the second quarter of 2009 was approximately $1.33 to the euro, compared to $1.32 to the euro in the first quarter of 2009 and $1.56 to the euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 increase in the dollar/euro exchange rate decreases operating income by approximately $0.3 million each quarter.
Recent Product Highlights
 
Business Outlook
The Company noted that while visibility remains limited, it anticipates third quarter 2009 revenues will increase 4% to 8% on a sequential basis.
Non-GAAP Metrics
Non-GAAP net (loss) income excludes charges related to restructuring activities, acquisitions, grant repayments, (gain) loss on sale of assets, and stock-based compensation, as well as distributor bad debt recovery, unsolicited M&A expense and the income tax effect of these excluded items. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included following the financial statements below.

Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP shares used in diluted net (loss) income per share calculations:
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net (loss) income and non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net (Loss) Income to Non-GAAP Net (Loss) Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on
 
an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes (gains) losses resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Distributor bad debt recovery related to a reserve and subsequent partial collection for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the Company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
The Company incurred certain expenses to advise the Company concerning the take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.

Item 8.01. Other Events
Settlement of Certain Litigation
On September 14, 2009, Atmel Corporation ("Atmel") entered into a memorandum of understanding ("MOU") providing for an agreement-in-principle to settle previously disclosed litigation regarding Atmel's response to a subsequently-withdrawn acquisition proposal by Microchip Technology Inc. and ON Semiconductor Corp, including Atmel's adoption of an amendment to its Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of October 18, 1999 (the "Rights Agreement"). The MOU provides for the full settlement and release of all claims by or against Atmel and all of the defendants related to the allegations and/or matters set forth in the litigation, which includes three stockholder class actions consolidated under the caption
In re Atmel Corporation Shareholders Litigation
filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Court"), and an action captioned
Zucker v. Laub, et. al.
filed in the Superior Court of the State of California (collectively, the "Litigation"). The suit pending before the Court alleged, among other things, that the definitions of "Beneficial Ownership" and "Derivatives Contract" in the Rights Agreement (as amended) were vague and unenforceable under Delaware law. The agreements set forth in the MOU are subject to and conditioned upon the negotiation and execution of a definitive settlement agreement, as well as final approval by the Court.
Under the MOU, Atmel agreed that if, prior to September 14, 2012, Atmel adopts a new stockholder rights plan that includes a "Derivative Contract" within the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" (a "New Derivatives Rights Plan"), Atmel will clarify that (i) the term "Derivatives Contract" excludes interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stock approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority; and (ii) to qualify as or constitute a "Derivatives Contract," a contractual arrangement must include or reference a number of "Notional Common Shares."
Pursuant to the MOU, on September 14, 2009, Atmel's Board of Directors (the "Board") passed a resolution interpreting Section 1(d)(iv) of the Rights Agreement (which defines the term "Beneficial Ownership") consistent with the provisions of the foregoing paragraph. The interpretations set forth in the Board resolution will terminate and have no further force and effect in the event that the settlement is not approved by the Court.
In addition, Atmel agreed that if, prior to September 14, 2012, Atmel (i) adopts a New Derivatives Rights Plan with an expiration date beyond the date of Atmel's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) extends the expiration date of the Rights Agreement beyond the date of Atmel's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, then Atmel will include a proposal for a stockholder advisory vote on the provision including Derivative Contracts in the definition of Beneficial Ownership in its proxy statement for the first annual meeting occurring more than 45 days after the date of such action. Under the terms of the MOU, the stockholder vote will not be binding on Atmel or the Board, will not be deemed to be a condition to the effectiveness of the New Derivative Rights Plan, and will not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board, nor to create or imply any additional fiduciary duty by the Board.
Atmel and the other defendants entered into the MOU without admitting or conceding any merit to any allegation made in the Litigation. Except as described above, the MOU provides for no constraint on the ability of Atmel and/or the Board to respond to any proposed acquisition or other transaction or to adopt or amend a stockholder rights plan in accordance with applicable Delaware law.
     
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Table of Contents

Exhibit 99.1
. . . Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009.
SAN JOSE, CA, November 5, 2009
Revenues for the third quarter of 2009 were $317.7 million, a 12% increase compared to $284.5 million for the second quarter of 2009, and a 21% decrease compared to $400.0 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008.
Net loss, on a GAAP basis, for the third quarter of 2009 totaled $(17.5) million or $(0.04) per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $(12.4) million or $(0.03) per diluted share for the second quarter of 2009 and a net loss of $(4.7) million or $(0.01) per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.
Non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2009 totaled $(4.0) million or $(0.01) per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net loss of $(0.6) million or $(0.00) per diluted share for the second quarter of 2009, and non-GAAP net income of $42.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.
Gross profit, as a percent of revenue, was 31.1% for the third quarter of 2009. This compares to gross profit of 32.3% for the second quarter of 2009 and 39.5% for the year-ago quarter. Gross profit has been adversely impacted by a reduction in factory utilization at the Company's two wafer fabrication facilities.
"We are pleased to have exceeded our revenue guidance this quarter with growth coming from all business segments and geographies," said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Sales of our microcontrollers grew 18% sequentially and we are excited by the production release of our maXTouch products, a leading family of capacitive touchscreen controllers, which are now being designed for use at top-tier OEMs."
Loss from operations was $(14.7) million for the third quarter of 2009. This compares to a loss from operations of $(17.6) million for the second quarter of 2009 and $(11.3) million for the third quarter of 2008.
 
Stock-based compensation expense was $7.6 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared to $6.4 million for the second quarter of 2009 and $7.4 million for the year-ago quarter.
Income tax provision totaled $(0.4) million for the third quarter of 2009. This compares to an income tax benefit of $9.7 million for the second quarter of 2009 and a benefit of $4.1 million for the third quarter of 2008. The prior quarter income tax benefits were the result of R&D tax credits as well as the reversal of tax liabilities no longer needed as a result of settlement of certain foreign tax audits.
Cash provided from operations totaled $59.4 million for the third quarter of 2009, compared to $1.6 million for the second quarter of 2009 and $67.2 million for the third quarter of 2008. Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $446.2 million at the end of the third quarter of 2009, an increase of $26.8 million from the end of the prior quarter. During the quarter, the Company repaid $21.5 million of its revolving credit facility; in the previous quarter the company repaid $20.0 million of its revolving credit facility.
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the third quarter of 2009 was approximately $1.41 to the euro, compared to $1.33 to the euro in the second quarter of 2009 and $1.54 to the euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 increase in the dollar/euro exchange rate decreases operating income by approximately $0.3 million each quarter.
Third Quarter 2009 Operational Highlights
Recent Product Highlights
 
Business Outlook
For the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company expects revenue will increase 3% to 7% on a sequential basis.
Non-GAAP Metrics
Non-GAAP net (loss) income excludes charges related to restructuring activities, acquisitions, grant repayments, asset impairment charges, gain on sale of assets, and stock-based compensation, as well as distributor bad debt recovery, unsolicited M&A expense and the income tax effect of these excluded items. A reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results is included following the financial statements below.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net (loss) income and non-GAAP net (loss) income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Net (Loss) Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
 
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel classifies assets as held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when the decision is made to sell the asset. The Company then records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value, less any selling costs, and the carrying value. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Distributor bad debt recovery related to a reserve and subsequent partial collection for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the Company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this recovery from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
The Company incurred certain expenses to advise the Company concerning the take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these expenses from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations. In the third quarter, the Company incurred approximately $1.0 million of unsolicited M&A expense related to a class-action derivative lawsuit settlement.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.

C. SETTLEMENT CONSIDERATION
     In consideration of the Settlement, the Parties agree as follows:
     2. If, prior to September 14, 2012, the Company adopts a new stockholder rights plan (the "New Rights Plan") that includes a "Derivative Contract" within the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" (the "New Derivative Rights Plan"), the Company shall clarify that: (i) the term "Derivatives Contract" excludes interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stocks approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority; and (ii) to qualify as or constitute a "Derivatives Contract," a contractual arrangement must include or reference a number of "Notional Common Shares."
     3. Pursuant to its powers under Section 29 of the Current Rights Agreement, the Board has passed a resolution interpreting Section 1(d)(iv) of the Current Rights Agreement, including any extension thereof, consistent with the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Stipulation (as defined above, the "Resolution"). On September 18, 2009, the Company publicized the adoption of the Resolution by issuing a Form 8-K, which was reviewed and commented upon by Plaintiffs' counsel in the Shareholder Actions. The obligations of the Company under this paragraph became effective pending Court approval of the Settlement, but shall terminate in the event the Settlement shall not be so approved.
     4. If, prior to September 14, 2012, the Company shall (i) adopt a New Derivative Rights Plan with an expiration date beyond the date of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, or (ii) extend the expiration date of the Current Rights Agreement beyond the date
 
of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, then the Company shall include a proposal for a stockholder advisory vote on the provision including Derivative Contracts in the definition of Beneficial Ownership in its proxy statement for the first annual meeting occurring more than 45 days after the date of such action. The stockholder vote shall not be binding on the Company or its Board, shall not be deemed to be a condition to the effectiveness of the New Derivative Rights Plan, and shall not be construed as overruling a decision by such Board, nor to create or imply any additional fiduciary duty by such Board.
1
     5. Other than as expressly set forth in this Stipulation, nothing in the Stipulation shall be deemed to constrain in any respect the ability of the Company and/or its Board to respond to any proposed acquisition or other transaction or to adopt or amend a stockholders rights plan in accordance with applicable Delaware law.
D. RELEASES
     6. Upon entry by the Court of the Final Judgment, each and every of the Plaintiff Releasors shall (i) fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, settle, relinquish, and dismiss with prejudice on the merits any and all Settled Plaintiffs' Claims against the Released Persons; (ii) permanently and forever be enjoined and barred from pursuing or prosecuting any Settled Plaintiffs' Claims, and from instituting or commencing any action or proceeding or otherwise suing any of the Released Persons for any Settled Plaintiffs' Claims; and (iii) covenant not to sue any of the Released Persons for any Settled Plaintiffs' Claims.
     7. Upon entry by the Court of the Final Judgment, each and every of the Defendant Releasors shall (i) fully, finally, and forever release, discharge, settle, relinquish, and dismiss with prejudice on the merits any and all Settled Defendants' Claims against Plaintiffs, the

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.
(ii) Plaintiff Releasors and Defendant Releasors also shall be deemed to waive any and all provisions, rights and benefits conferred by any law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of common law, which is similar, comparable or equivalent to California Civil Code  1542; and (iii) Plaintiffs, on behalf of the Plaintiff Releasors, and Defendants, on behalf of Defendant Releasors, acknowledge that they may discover facts in addition to or different from those that they now know or believe to be true with respect to the subject matter of the Settled Plaintiffs' Claims or the Settled Defendants' Claims, but that it is their intention to fully, finally
 
and forever settle and release any and all claims released hereby, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which now exist, or heretofore existed, or may hereafter exist, and without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such additional or different facts. Defendants and Plaintiffs each acknowledge, and Defendant Releasors and Plaintiff Releasors shall be deemed by operation of the entry of the Final Judgment to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waivers were separately bargained for and are a key element of the Settlement of which this release is a part.

Atmel shall assume administrative responsibility for and will pay all reasonable costs and expenses related to preparing and disseminating the Notice, irrespective of whether the Court approves the form and manner of notice described in this paragraph, and in no event shall Plaintiffs, the Settlement Class Members, or their counsel be responsible for any notice costs or expenses.
G. ORDER AND FINAL JUDGMENT; DISMISSAL OF CALIFORNIA ACTION
     12. If the Court approves the Settlement (including any modification thereto made with the consent of the Parties), the Parties shall jointly request that the Court enter the proposed Final Judgment.
     13.

H. CONDITIONS OF SETTLEMENT; TERMINATION
     14. Plaintiffs shall be afforded such reasonable document discovery as is necessary for Plaintiffs to confirm that the Settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate ("Confirmatory Discovery"), which discovery shall be completed by November 6, 2009.
     15. This Stipulation and the Settlement described herein shall not be legally binding upon any Party unless and until this Stipulation is executed by all of the Parties.

proposed Settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable; (b) the Court finally certifying, for settlement purposes only, a Settlement Class, as defined herein; and (c) Final Court Approval of the Final Judgment and dismissal of the Shareholder Actions in their entirety with prejudice on the merits and without awarding fees, expenses or costs to any party (except as provided in paragraph 20 hereof). The approval of attorneys' fees and expenses is not a condition of the Settlement, and any failure by the Court to approve attorneys' fees and expenses in whole or in part shall have no effect on the Settlement set forth in the Stipulation.
     17. From execution of this Stipulation until Final Court Approval or the termination of this Stipulation in accordance with paragraph 18 below, Plaintiffs and all Settlement Class Members, or any of them, are barred and enjoined from commencing, prosecuting, instigating, or in any way participating in the commencement or prosecution of any action or proceeding asserting any Settled Plaintiffs' Claims against any of the Released Persons.
     18.

The provisions contained in this Stipulation shall not be deemed a presumption, concession, or admission by any Party of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing or lack of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing, as to any facts or claims alleged or asserted in the Shareholder Actions, or any other actions or proceedings, and shall not be interpreted, construed, deemed, invoked, or
 
offered, revealed in evidence, or otherwise used by any Person in the Shareholder Actions or in any other action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, except in connection with any proceeding to enforce the terms of this Settlement. If the Settlement does not receive Final Court Approval, the Parties shall revert to their respective litigation positions as if this Stipulation, and all negotiations, discussions and proceedings in connection herewith, never existed.
     25.

II.
BACKGROUND OF THE SHAREHOLDER ACTIONS
     The Shareholder Actions arise out of a joint proposal that Microchip Technology Incorporated ("Microchip") and ON Semiconductor Corporation ("ON Semi") publicly announced on October 2, 2008, to acquire Atmel Corporation ("Atmel" or the "Company") for $5.00 per share in cash, subject to certain conditions (the "Acquisition Proposal").
     On October 29, 2008, Atmel announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") had rejected the Acquisition Proposal.
     On November 7, 2008, Microchip received clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 to acquire over 50% of Atmel's shares.
     On November 10, 2008, the Board adopted an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Company's Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of October 18, 1999 (the "Current Rights Agreement"). The Amendment expanded the
 
definition of "Beneficial Ownership" to include "Derivatives Transactions" in determining whether a person is an "Acquiring Person" under the Current Rights Agreement and lowered the threshold to become an "Acquiring Person" from 20% to 10% for any person or group that made a "Takeover Proposal" on or after October 1, 2008.
     On November 13, 2008, Lawrence Zucker ("Zucker") filed the California Action alleging shareholder class and derivative claims against Steven Laub, Tsung-Ching Wu Ph.D., David Sugishita, Charles Carinalli, Papken Der Torossian, Jack L. Saltich, and Dr. Edward Ross (the "Individual Defendants") and the Company (collectively, the "Defendants") for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and corporate waste relating to the Company's response to the Acquisition Proposal.
     On November 14, 2008, LAMPERS filed a shareholder class action complaint captioned , C.A. No. 4161-CC ("LAMPERS Action"), alleging that the Individual Defendants had breached their fiduciary duties to Atmel's shareholders by refusing to respond in good faith to the Acquisition Proposal and by adopting the Amendment.
LAMPERS v. Laub et al.
     On November 18, 2008, ON Semi and Microchip announced their withdrawal of the Acquisition Proposal.
     On February 2, 2009, LAMPERS filed a Motion For Injunctive Relief seeking a permanent injunction or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction, to invalidate the Amendment on the grounds, , that the language of the Amendment regarding
inter alia
 
"Derivatives Contracts" is unenforceably vague and the Individual Defendants' adoption of the Amendment constituted a breach of fiduciary duty.
     On February 18, 2009, the Court consolidated the LAMPERS Action with two actions that had previously been filed in this Court, captioned , C.A. No. 4092-CC and , C.A. No. 4094-CC, appointed the law firms of Grant & Eisenhofer, P.A. and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP as co-lead counsel ("Co-Lead Counsel") for the plaintiffs in the consolidated action, and designated LAMPERS's complaint as the operative complaint in the Delaware Action.
Kuhn v. Atmel Corporation et al.
Gebhardt v. Atmel Corporation et al.
     The relief sought by Zucker and LAMPERS (together, "Plaintiffs") in the Shareholder Actions includes, , a declaratory judgment that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, injunctive relief invalidating the Amendment, and an award of damages, attorneys' fees and expenses.
inter alia
     On March 12, 2009, the Superior Court of the State of California entered a stay of the California Action.
     On May 19, 2009, the Court denied LAMPERS's Motion For Injunctive Relief and indicated that the parties should confer on a schedule that would enable the trial of the Delaware Action to occur before the end of October 2009.
     On June 2, 2009, LAMPERS filed an Amended Verified Class Action Complaint ("Amended Complaint") in the Delaware Action which, , included a new Count II seeking a declaration that the Amendment is invalid and unenforceable.
inter alia
 
     On June 9, 2009, the Court entered a Scheduling Order in the Delaware Action providing for completion of fact discovery by August 26, 2009, completion of expert discovery by September 25, 2009, and a trial date of October 27, 2009.
     In June, 2009, the parties to the Delaware Action served extensive document requests, interrogatories and requests for admissions, and LAMPERS served a document subpoena on Atmel.
     On June 18, 2009, the Individual Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint and on June 19, 2009, filed their Answer to the Amended Complaint.
     On July 10, 2009, the Court entered a Revised Scheduling Order in the Delaware Action setting forth a briefing schedule on the Individual Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint and providing for completion of fact discovery by October 9, 2009, completion of expert discovery by November 9, 2009, and a trial date of December 14, 2009.
     On July 27, 2009, LAMPERS filed its Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint.
     In early August 2009, the parties to the Delaware Action agreed to an informal stay of the proceedings in the Delaware Action while they continued to pursue settlement discussions that had commenced in early June 2009.
     In September 2009, the Company produced documents in the Delaware Action relating to the Board's consideration of the Acquisition Proposal and adoption of the Amendment;
 
     On September 14, 2009, following extensive arm's-length settlement negotiations, Atmel and the parties to the Shareholder Actions entered into a memorandum of understanding ("MOU") setting forth an agreement-in-principle to resolve the Shareholder Actions on the terms and conditions set forth therein, which are described below. The MOU provided, among other things, that the Board shall immediately pass a resolution pursuant to its powers under Section 29 of the Current Rights Agreement, which was set to expire on October 15, 2009, interpreting Section 1(d)(iv) of the Current Rights Agreement, including any extension thereof, to clarify that (i) the term "Derivatives Contract" excludes interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stocks approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority; and (ii) to qualify as or constitute a "Derivatives Contract," a contractual arrangement must include or reference a number of "Notional Common Shares" (the "Resolution").
     On September 14, 2009, the Board adopted the Resolution. On September 15, 2009, counsel in the Delaware Action informed the Court during a teleconference that Atmel and the parties in the Delaware Action had entered the MOU and that the Resolution had been adopted. On September 18, 2009, pursuant to the MOU, Atmel filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing, among other things, the adoption of the Resolution.
     Zucker considered the terms and conditions of the Settlement and, believing the Settlement to be fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interest of Atmel and of the
 
class in the California Action, agreed to dismiss the California Action in its entirety, with prejudice, in consideration of the Settlement.
     On November 6, 2009, the parties to the Shareholder Actions entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release ("Stipulation") that, among other things, memorialized the terms of the MOU. On November , 2009, the parties submitted the Stipulation to the Court. On November , 2009, the Court entered a scheduling order (the "Scheduling Order") that preliminarily, for purposes of the Settlement only, certified the Settlement Class.
        
        
III.
THE SETTLEMENT AND PARTICIPATION IN THE SETTLEMENT
     In consideration for the Settlement (including any claim for attorneys' fees) and the release of the Settled Plaintiffs' Claims and Settled Defendants' Claims (defined in Section IV below), the following actions have occurred or, as appropriate, will occur:
(a) If, prior to September 14, 2012, the Company adopts a new stockholder rights plan (the "New Rights Plan") that includes a "Derivative Contract" within the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" (the "New Derivative Rights Plan"), the Company shall clarify that: (i) the term "Derivatives Contract" excludes interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stocks approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority; and (ii) to qualify as or constitute a "Derivatives Contract," a contractual arrangement must include or reference a number of "Notional Common Shares."
 
(b) Pursuant to its powers under Section 29 of the Current Rights Agreement, the Board has passed a resolution interpreting Section 1(d)(iv) of the Current Rights Agreement, including any extension thereof, consistent with the foregoing paragraph (a) (as defined above, the "Resolution"). On September 18, 2009, the Company publicized the adoption of the Resolution by issuing a Form 8-K, which was reviewed and commented on by Plaintiffs' counsel in the Shareholder Actions. The obligation of the Company to interpret Section 1(d)(iv) of the Current Rights Agreement as set forth in the Resolution became effective pending Court approval of the Settlement, but shall terminate in the event the Settlement shall not be so approved.
(c) If, prior to September 14, 2012, the Company shall (i) adopt a New Derivative Rights Plan with an expiration date beyond the date of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, or (ii) extend the expiration date of the Current Rights Agreement beyond the date of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, then the Company shall include a proposal for a stockholder advisory vote on the provision including Derivative Contracts in the definition of Beneficial Ownership in its proxy statement for the first annual meeting occurring more than 45 days after the date of such action. The stockholder vote shall not be binding on the Company or its Board, shall not be deemed to be a condition to the effectiveness of the New Derivative Rights Plan,
2
 
 
and shall not be construed as overruling a decision by such Board, nor to create or imply any additional fiduciary duty by such Board.
Other than as expressly set forth in Section III (a)-(c) above, nothing in the Settlement shall be deemed to constrain in any respect the ability of the Company and/or its Board to respond to any proposed acquisition or other transaction or to adopt or amend a stockholders rights plan in accordance with applicable Delaware law.
     Atmel has assumed administrative responsibility for and will pay all reasonable costs and expenses related to preparing and disseminating this Notice in accordance with the Stipulation. If you are a member of the Settlement Class ("Settlement Class Member"), you will be bound by any judgment entered in the Delaware Action whether or not you actually receive this Notice. You may not opt out of the Settlement Class.

V.
REASONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT
     Co-Lead Counsel have reviewed and analyzed the facts and circumstances relating to the claims asserted in the Delaware Action, as known by LAMPERS and Co-Lead Counsel to date, including conducting confirmatory discovery, conducting discussions with counsel to Defendants, and analyzing documents obtained through publicly available sources, applicable case law, and other authorities. Based on this investigation, LAMPERS has decided to enter into the Stipulation and settle the Delaware Action, after taking into account, among other things, (1) the substantial benefits to members of the Settlement Class from the litigation of the Delaware Action and the Settlement; (2) the risks of continued litigation in the Delaware Action and the uncertainty of its outcome; (3) the probability of success on the merits and the allegations in the Delaware Action, including the uncertainty relating to the proof of those allegations; (4) the desirability of permitting the Settlement to be consummated as
 
provided by the terms of the Stipulation; and (5) the conclusion of Co-Lead Counsel that the terms and conditions of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interests of LAMPERS and the Settlement Class.
     Counsel for Zucker in the California Action has reviewed and analyzed the facts and circumstances relating to the claims asserted in the California Action, as known by Zucker and his counsel to date, including conducting confirmatory discovery, conducting discussions with counsel to Defendants, and analyzing documents obtained through publicly available sources, applicable case law, and other authorities. Based on this investigation, Zucker has decided to enter into the Stipulation and settle the California Action, after taking into account, among other things, (1) the substantial benefits to members of the Settlement Class from the litigation of the California Action and the Settlement; (2) the risks of continued litigation in the California Action and the uncertainty of the outcome of the California Action; (3) the probability of success on the merits and the allegations in the California Action, including the uncertainty relating to the proof of those allegations; (4) the desirability of permitting the Settlement to be consummated as provided by the terms of the Stipulation; and (5) the conclusion of counsel for Zucker that the terms and conditions of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interests of Zucker and the Settlement Class.
     Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, any wrongdoing or liability with respect to all claims, events, and transactions complained of in the Shareholder Actions and deny that any of the claims Plaintiffs have asserted in the Shareholder Actions has
 
any legal merit. Defendants have entered into the Settlement solely to eliminate the burden, risk and expense of further litigation.
VI.
APPLICATION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES
     Concurrent with seeking approval of the Settlement, Co-Lead Counsel shall apply to the Court for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses to Plaintiffs' counsel in an amount not to exceed $950,000. Defendants shall not oppose an application by Co-Lead Counsel for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent that such application does not exceed $950,000 in the aggregate. No other application for attorneys' fees and expenses shall be filed, and Plaintiffs' counsel expressly waives any right to seek any award of fees and expenses except as provided in the Stipulation.
     Subject to entry of the Final Judgment as provided for below, and pursuant to its pre-existing obligations to indemnify the Individual Defendants, Atmel has agreed to pay Plaintiffs' counsel such attorneys' fees and expenses as the Court may award, up to $950,000 (the "Fee Award"). The Fee Award is subject to Final Court Approval, which means that the Court has entered a Final Judgment approving the Settlement and that such Final Judgment is finally affirmed on appeal or is no longer subject to appeal and the time for any petition for reargument, appeal or review, by certiorari or otherwise, has expired. The Fee Award is in consideration of the release of claims against the Individual Defendants provided for in the Stipulation.

Press Release
SAN JOSE, Calif., Nov. ___, 2009/PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/  Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML) today announced that it has entered a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release (the "Stipulation") to settle previously disclosed litigation regarding Atmel's response to a subsequently-withdrawn acquisition proposal by Microchip Technology Inc. and ON Semiconductor Corporation, including Atmel's adoption of an amendment to its Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of October 18, 1999 (the "Rights Agreement"). The terms of the Stipulation are based on the terms of an agreement-in-principle set forth in a Memorandum of Understanding dated as of September 14, 2009, which Atmel announced in a September 18, 2009 Form 8-K.
The Stipulation provides, on behalf of a non-opt out class consisting of all record holders and beneficial owners of Atmel common stock at any time during the period from October 2, 2008 through and including November 6, 2009 (the "Settlement Class"), for the full settlement and release of all claims by or against Atmel and all of the defendants related to the allegations and/or matters set forth in three stockholder class actions consolidated under the caption filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Court"), and a class and derivative action captioned filed in the Superior Court of the State of California (collectively, the "Shareholder Actions"). The suit pending before the Court alleged, among other things, that the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" and "Derivatives Contract" in the Rights Agreement (as amended) were vague and unenforceable under Delaware law. The settlement set forth in the Stipulation is subject to and conditioned upon obtaining final approval by the Court.
In re Atmel Corporation Shareholders Litigation
Zucker v. Laub, et. al.
Under the Stipulation, Atmel agreed that if, prior to September 14, 2012, Atmel adopts a new stockholder rights plan that includes a "Derivative Contract" within the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" (a "New Derivative Rights Plan"), Atmel will clarify that (i) the term "Derivatives Contract" excludes interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stock approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority; and (ii) to qualify as or constitute a "Derivatives Contract," a contractual arrangement must include or reference a number of "Notional Common Shares." On September 14, 2009, Atmel's Board of Directors (the "Board") passed a resolution interpreting Section 1(d)(iv) of the Rights Agreement (which defines the term "Beneficial Ownership") consistent with the foregoing.
     In the Stipulation, Atmel also agreed that if, prior to September 14, 2012, Atmel adopts a New Derivative Rights Plan with an expiration date beyond the date of Atmel's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, then Atmel will include a proposal for a stockholder advisory vote on the provision including Derivative Contracts in the definition of Beneficial Ownership in its proxy statement for the first annual meeting occurring more than 45 days after the date of such action. Under the terms of the Stipulation, the
 
stockholder vote will not be binding on Atmel or the Board, will not be deemed to be a condition to the effectiveness of the New Derivative Rights Plan, and will not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board, nor to create or imply any additional fiduciary duty by the Board. Atmel agreed to the same advisory vote provision if it extended the expiration date of the Rights Agreement beyond the date of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, but the Rights Agreement expired on October 15, 2009, making that provision no longer operative.
As part of the settlement, Atmel also has agreed not to oppose plaintiffs' attorneys' application to the Court for an award of fees and expenses up to a limit of $950,000. Pursuant to its pre-existing obligations to indemnify the Board, Atmel shall pay such an award as the Court may approve, up to $950,000.
Atmel and the Board entered into the Stipulation without admitting or conceding any merit to any allegation made in the Shareholder Actions solely to eliminate the burden, risk and expense of further litigation. Except as described above, the Stipulation provides for no constraint on the ability of Atmel and/or the Board to respond to any proposed acquisition or other transaction or to adopt or amend a stockholder rights plan in accordance with applicable Delaware law.
The Court has scheduled a hearing on [date], to be held at the Court of Chancery, 34 The Circle, Georgetown, Delaware 19947, for the purpose of, among other things, (i) determining whether the settlement set forth in the Stipulation should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the Settlement Class, and (ii) hearing and determining any objections to the settlement or the application of plaintiffs' attorneys' for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses. Any shareholder desiring further information about the settlement or wishing to be heard at the Court hearing, should consult the Notice of Pendency of Class Action, Proposed Class Action Determination, Proposed Settlement of Class Action, Settlement Hearing, and Right to Appear, which is available on Atmel's website at .

PURPOSE OF NOTICE
     The purpose of this Notice is to inform you of the proposed settlement (the "Settlement") of the above-captioned lawsuit (the "Delaware Action") by and between the parties to the action pending in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Court"), and by and between the parties in certain litigation described below pending in the Superior Court of the State of California (the "California Action") (together, the Delaware Action and the California Action are referred to herein as the "Shareholder Actions"). This Notice also informs you of the Court's certification of a Settlement Class (as defined below) for purposes of the Settlement, and notifies you of your right to
 
participate in a hearing to be held on January 7, 2010 at 2:30 p.m. EDT, before the Court at 34 The Circle, Georgetown, Delaware 19947 (the "Settlement Hearing") to determine whether the Court should approve the Settlement as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the Settlement Class, to determine whether Class Plaintiff Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System ("LAMPERS" or "Class Plaintiff") and its counsel have adequately represented the interests of the Settlement Class in the Delaware Action, and to consider other matters, including a request by Co-Lead Counsel (defined below) for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses.
     The Court has determined that, for purposes of the Settlement only, the Delaware Action shall be preliminarily maintained as a non-opt-out class action pursuant to Court of Chancery Rules 23(a), 23(b)(1), and 23(b)(2) by LAMPERS as Settlement Class representative, on behalf of all Persons (excluding Defendants, their immediate families, heirs and assigns, and those in privity with them) who owned common stock of Atmel Corporation, as record or beneficial holders, at any time from October 2, 2008, through and including November 6, 2009 (the "Settlement Class"). At the Settlement Hearing, among other things, the Court will consider whether the Settlement Class should be finally certified pursuant to Court of Chancery Rule 23 and whether LAMPERS and its counsel have adequately represented the Settlement Class.

     This Notice describes the rights you may have under the Settlement and what steps you may, but are not required to, take in relation to the Settlement.

THE FOLLOWING RECITATION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE FINDINGS OF THE COURT. IT IS BASED ON STATEMENTS OF THE PARTIES AND SHOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD AS AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OPINION OF THE COURT AS TO THE MERITS OF ANY OF THE CLAIMS OR DEFENSES RAISED BY ANY OF THE PARTIES.
II.
BACKGROUND OF THE SHAREHOLDER ACTIONS
     The Shareholder Actions arise out of a joint proposal that Microchip Technology Incorporated ("Microchip") and ON Semiconductor Corporation ("ON Semi") publicly announced on October 2, 2008, to acquire Atmel Corporation ("Atmel" or the "Company") for $5.00 per share in cash, subject to certain conditions (the "Acquisition Proposal").
     On October 29, 2008, Atmel announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") had rejected the Acquisition Proposal.
     On November 7, 2008, Microchip received clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 to acquire over 50% of Atmel's shares.
     On November 10, 2008, the Board adopted an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Company's Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of October 18, 1999 (the "Current Rights Agreement"). The Amendment expanded the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" to include "Derivatives Transactions" in determining whether a person is an "Acquiring Person" under the Current Rights
 
Agreement and lowered the threshold to become an "Acquiring Person" from 20% to 10% for any person or group that made a "Takeover Proposal" on or after October 1, 2008.
     On November 13, 2008, Lawrence Zucker ("Zucker") filed the California Action alleging shareholder class and derivative claims against Steven Laub, Tsung-Ching Wu Ph.D., David Sugishita, Charles Carinalli, Papken Der Torossian, Jack L. Saltich, and Dr. Edward Ross (the "Individual Defendants") and the Company (collectively, the "Defendants") for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and corporate waste relating to the Company's response to the Acquisition Proposal.
     On November 14, 2008, LAMPERS filed a shareholder class action complaint captioned , C.A. No. 4161-CC ("LAMPERS Action"), alleging that the Individual Defendants had breached their fiduciary duties to Atmel's shareholders by refusing to respond in good faith to the Acquisition Proposal and by adopting the Amendment.
LAMPERS v. Laub et al.
     On November 18, 2008, ON Semi and Microchip announced their withdrawal of the Acquisition Proposal.
     On February 2, 2009, LAMPERS filed a Motion For Injunctive Relief seeking a permanent injunction or, in the alternative, a preliminary injunction, to invalidate the Amendment on the grounds, , that the language of the Amendment regarding "Derivatives Contracts" is unenforceably vague and the Individual Defendants' adoption of the Amendment constituted a breach of fiduciary duty.
inter alia
 
     On February 18, 2009, the Court consolidated the LAMPERS Action with two actions that had previously been filed in this Court, captioned , C.A. No. 4092-CC and , C.A. No. 4094-CC, appointed the law firms of Grant & Eisenhofer, P.A. and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP as co-lead counsel ("Co-Lead Counsel") for the plaintiffs in the consolidated action, and designated LAMPERS's complaint as the operative complaint in the Delaware Action.
Kuhn v. Atmel Corporation et al.
Gebhardt v. Atmel Corporation et al.
     The relief sought by Zucker and LAMPERS (together, "Plaintiffs") in the Shareholder Actions includes, , a declaratory judgment that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, injunctive relief invalidating the Amendment, and an award of damages, attorneys' fees and expenses.
inter alia
     On March 12, 2009, the Superior Court of the State of California entered a stay of the California Action.
     On May 19, 2009, the Court denied LAMPERS's Motion For Injunctive Relief and indicated that the parties should confer on a schedule that would enable the trial of the Delaware Action to occur before the end of October 2009.
     On June 2, 2009, LAMPERS filed an Amended Verified Class Action Complaint ("Amended Complaint") in the Delaware Action which, , included a new Count II seeking a declaration that the Amendment is invalid and unenforceable.
inter alia
     On June 9, 2009, the Court entered a Scheduling Order in the Delaware Action providing for completion of fact discovery by August 26, 2009, completion of expert discovery by September 25, 2009, and a trial date of October 27, 2009.
 
     In June, 2009, the parties to the Delaware Action served extensive document requests, interrogatories and requests for admissions, and LAMPERS served a document subpoena on Atmel.
     On June 18, 2009, the Individual Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint and on June 19, 2009, filed their Answer to the Amended Complaint.
     On July 10, 2009, the Court entered a Revised Scheduling Order in the Delaware Action setting forth a briefing schedule on the Individual Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint and providing for completion of fact discovery by October 9, 2009, completion of expert discovery by November 9, 2009, and a trial date of December 14, 2009.
     On July 27, 2009, LAMPERS filed its Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss Count II of the Amended Complaint.
     In early August 2009, the parties to the Delaware Action agreed to an informal stay of the proceedings in the Delaware Action while they continued to pursue settlement discussions that had commenced in early June 2009.
     In September 2009, the Company produced documents in the Delaware Action relating to the Board's consideration of the Acquisition Proposal and adoption of the Amendment;
     On September 14, 2009, following extensive arm's-length settlement negotiations, Atmel and the parties to the Shareholder Actions entered into a memorandum of understanding ("MOU") setting forth an agreement-in-principle to
 
resolve the Shareholder Actions on the terms and conditions set forth therein, which are described below. The MOU provided, among other things, that the Board shall immediately pass a resolution pursuant to its powers under Section 29 of the Current Rights Agreement, which was set to expire on October 15, 2009, interpreting Section 1(d)(iv) of the Current Rights Agreement, including any extension thereof, to clarify that (i) the term "Derivatives Contract" excludes interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stocks approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority; and (ii) to qualify as or constitute a "Derivatives Contract," a contractual arrangement must include or reference a number of "Notional Common Shares" (the "Resolution").
     On September 14, 2009, the Board adopted the Resolution. On September 15, 2009, counsel in the Delaware Action informed the Court during a teleconference that Atmel and the parties in the Delaware Action had entered the MOU and that the Resolution had been adopted. On September 18, 2009, pursuant to the MOU, Atmel filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing, among other things, the adoption of the Resolution.
     Zucker considered the terms and conditions of the Settlement and, believing the Settlement to be fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interest of Atmel and of the class in the California Action, agreed to dismiss the California Action in its entirety, with prejudice, in consideration of the Settlement.
     On November 6, 2009, the parties to the Shareholder Actions entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release ("Stipulation") that,
 
among other things, memorialized the terms of the MOU. On November 9, 2009, the parties submitted the Stipulation to the Court. On November 16, 2009, the Court entered a scheduling order (the "Scheduling Order") that preliminarily, for purposes of the Settlement only, certified the Settlement Class.
III.

(a) If, prior to September 14, 2012, the Company adopts a new stockholder rights plan (the "New Rights Plan") that includes a "Derivative Contract" within the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" (the "New Derivative Rights Plan"), the Company shall clarify that: (i) the term "Derivatives Contract" excludes interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stocks approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority; and (ii) to qualify as or constitute a "Derivatives Contract," a contractual arrangement must include or reference a number of "Notional Common Shares."
(b) Pursuant to its powers under Section 29 of the Current Rights Agreement, the Board has passed a resolution interpreting Section 1(d)(iv) of the Current Rights Agreement, including any extension thereof, consistent with the foregoing paragraph (a) (as defined above, the "Resolution"). On September 18, 2009, the Company publicized the adoption of the Resolution by issuing a Form 8-K, which
 
was reviewed and commented on by Plaintiffs' counsel in the Shareholder Actions. The obligation of the Company to interpret Section 1(d)(iv) of the Current Rights Agreement as set forth in the Resolution became effective pending Court approval of the Settlement, but shall terminate in the event the Settlement shall not be so approved.
(c) If, prior to September 14, 2012, the Company shall (i) adopt a New Derivative Rights Plan with an expiration date beyond the date of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, or (ii) extend the expiration date of the Current Rights Agreement beyond the date of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, then the Company shall include a proposal for a stockholder advisory vote on the provision including Derivative Contracts in the definition of Beneficial Ownership in its proxy statement for the first annual meeting occurring more than 45 days after the date of such action.

respond to any proposed acquisition or other transaction or to adopt or amend a stockholders rights plan in accordance with applicable Delaware law.

(ii) Plaintiff Releasors and Defendant Releasors also shall be deemed to waive any and all provisions, rights and benefits conferred by any law of any state or territory of the United States, or principle of common law, which is similar, comparable or equivalent to California Civil Code  1542; and (iii) Plaintiffs, on behalf of the Plaintiff Releasors, and Defendants, on behalf of Defendant Releasors, acknowledge that they may discover facts in addition to or different from those that they now know or believe to be true with respect to the subject matter of the Settled Plaintiffs' Claims or the Settled Defendants' Claims, but that it is their intention to fully, finally and forever settle and release any and all claims released hereby, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, which now exist, or heretofore existed, or may hereafter exist, and without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such additional or different facts.
     (e) As used in the releases, the following terms have the following definitions:

V.
REASONS FOR THE SETTLEMENT
     Co-Lead Counsel have reviewed and analyzed the facts and circumstances relating to the claims asserted in the Delaware Action, as known by LAMPERS and Co-Lead Counsel to date, including conducting confirmatory discovery, conducting discussions with counsel to Defendants, and analyzing documents obtained through publicly available sources, applicable case law, and other authorities. Based on this investigation, LAMPERS has decided to enter into the Stipulation and settle the Delaware Action, after taking into account, among other things, (1) the substantial benefits to members of the Settlement Class from the litigation of the Delaware Action and the Settlement; (2) the risks of continued litigation in the Delaware Action and the uncertainty of its outcome; (3) the probability of success on the merits and the allegations in the Delaware Action, including the uncertainty relating to the proof of those allegations; (4) the desirability of permitting the Settlement to be consummated as provided by the terms of the Stipulation; and (5) the conclusion of Co-Lead Counsel that
 
the terms and conditions of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interests of LAMPERS and the Settlement Class.
     Counsel for Zucker in the California Action has reviewed and analyzed the facts and circumstances relating to the claims asserted in the California Action, as known by Zucker and his counsel to date, including conducting confirmatory discovery, conducting discussions with counsel to Defendants, and analyzing documents obtained through publicly available sources, applicable case law, and other authorities. Based on this investigation, Zucker has decided to enter into the Stipulation and settle the California Action, after taking into account, among other things, (1) the substantial benefits to members of the Settlement Class from the litigation of the California Action and the Settlement; (2) the risks of continued litigation in the California Action and the uncertainty of the outcome of the California Action; (3) the probability of success on the merits and the allegations in the California Action, including the uncertainty relating to the proof of those allegations; (4) the desirability of permitting the Settlement to be consummated as provided by the terms of the Stipulation; and (5) the conclusion of counsel for Zucker that the terms and conditions of the Settlement are fair, reasonable, adequate and in the best interests of Zucker and the Settlement Class.
     Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, any wrongdoing or liability with respect to all claims, events, and transactions complained of in the Shareholder Actions and deny that any of the claims Plaintiffs have asserted in the Shareholder Actions has any legal merit. Defendants have entered into the Settlement solely to eliminate the burden, risk and expense of further litigation.
 
VI.
APPLICATION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES
     Concurrent with seeking approval of the Settlement, Co-Lead Counsel shall apply to the Court for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses to Plaintiffs' counsel in an amount not to exceed $950,000. Defendants shall not oppose an application by Co-Lead Counsel for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent that such application does not exceed $950,000 in the aggregate. No other application for attorneys' fees and expenses shall be filed, and Plaintiffs' counsel expressly waives any right to seek any award of fees and expenses except as provided in the Stipulation.
     Subject to entry of the Final Judgment as provided for below, and pursuant to its pre-existing obligations to indemnify the Individual Defendants, Atmel has agreed to pay Plaintiffs' counsel such attorneys' fees and expenses as the Court may award, up to $950,000 (the "Fee Award"). The Fee Award is subject to Final Court Approval, which means that the Court has entered a Final Judgment approving the Settlement and that such Final Judgment is finally affirmed on appeal or is no longer subject to appeal and the time for any petition for reargument, appeal or review, by certiorari or otherwise, has expired. The Fee Award is in consideration of the release of claims against the Individual Defendants provided for in the Stipulation.
 
VII.
CLASS ACTION DETERMINATION
     The Court has ordered that, for purposes of the Settlement only, the Action shall be preliminarily maintained as a class action by LAMPERS as the Settlement Class representative, pursuant to Chancery Court Rules 23(a), 23(b)(l), and 23(b)(2), with the Class defined as set forth above.

Exhibit 99.3
/PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/  Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML) today announced that it has entered a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement and Release (the "Stipulation") to settle previously disclosed litigation regarding Atmel's response to a subsequently-withdrawn acquisition proposal by Microchip Technology Inc. and ON Semiconductor Corporation, including Atmel's adoption of an amendment to its Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, dated as of October 18, 1999 (the "Rights Agreement"). The terms of the Stipulation are based on the terms of an agreement-in-principle set forth in a Memorandum of Understanding dated as of September 14, 2009, which Atmel announced in a September 18, 2009 Form 8-K.
SAN JOSE, Calif., November 16, 2009
The Stipulation provides, on behalf of a non-opt out class consisting of all record holders and beneficial owners of Atmel common stock at any time during the period from October 2, 2008 through and including November 6, 2009 (the "Settlement Class"), for the full settlement and release of all claims by or against Atmel and all of the defendants related to the allegations and/or matters set forth in three stockholder class actions consolidated under the caption In re Atmel Corporation Shareholders Litigation filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "Court"), and a class and derivative action captioned Zucker v. Laub, et. al. filed in the Superior Court of the State of California (collectively, the "Shareholder Actions"). The suit pending before the Court alleged, among other things, that the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" and "Derivatives Contract" in the Rights Agreement (as amended) were vague and unenforceable under Delaware law. The settlement set forth in the Stipulation is subject to and conditioned upon obtaining final approval by the Court.
Under the Stipulation, Atmel agreed that if, prior to September 14, 2012, Atmel adopts a new stockholder rights plan that includes a "Derivative Contract" within the definition of "Beneficial Ownership" (a "New Derivative Rights Plan"), Atmel will clarify that (i) the term "Derivatives Contract" excludes interests in broad-based index options, broad-based index futures, and broad-based publicly traded market baskets of stock approved for trading by the appropriate federal governmental authority; and (ii) to qualify as or constitute a "Derivatives Contract," a contractual arrangement must include or reference a number of "Notional Common Shares." On September 14,
 
 
2009, Atmel's Board of Directors (the "Board") passed a resolution interpreting Section 1(d)(iv) of the Rights Agreement (which defines the term "Beneficial Ownership") consistent with the foregoing.
In the Stipulation, Atmel also agreed that if, prior to September 14, 2012, Atmel adopts a New Derivative Rights Plan with an expiration date beyond the date of Atmel's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, then Atmel will include a proposal for a stockholder advisory vote on the provision including Derivative Contracts in the definition of Beneficial Ownership in its proxy statement for the first annual meeting occurring more than 45 days after the date of such action. Under the terms of the Stipulation, the stockholder vote will not be binding on Atmel or the Board, will not be deemed to be a condition to the effectiveness of the New Derivative Rights Plan, and will not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board, nor to create or imply any additional fiduciary duty by the Board. Atmel agreed to the same advisory vote provision if it extended the expiration date of the Rights Agreement beyond the date of the Company's 2010 annual meeting of stockholders, but the Rights Agreement expired on October 15, 2009, making that provision no longer operative.
As part of the settlement, Atmel also has agreed not to oppose plaintiffs' attorneys' application to the Court for an award of fees and expenses up to a limit of $950,000. Pursuant to its pre-existing obligations to indemnify the Board, Atmel shall pay such an award as the Court may approve, up to $950,000.
Atmel and the Board entered into the Stipulation without admitting or conceding any merit to any allegation made in the Shareholder Actions solely to eliminate the burden, risk and expense of further litigation. Except as described above, the Stipulation provides for no constraint on the ability of Atmel and/or the Board to respond to any proposed acquisition or other transaction or to adopt or amend a stockholder rights plan in accordance with applicable Delaware law.
The Court has scheduled a hearing on January 7, 2010, at 2:30 p.m., to be held at the Court of Chancery, 34 The Circle, Georgetown, Delaware 19947, for the purpose of, among other things, (i) determining whether the settlement set forth in the Stipulation should be approved by the Court as fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the Settlement Class, and (ii) hearing and determining any objections to the settlement or the application of plaintiffs' attorneys' for an award of attorneys' fees and expenses. Any shareholder desiring further information about the settlement or wishing to be heard at the Court hearing, should consult the Notice of Pendency of Class Action, Proposed Class Action Determination, Proposed Settlement of Class Action, Settlement Hearing, and Right to Appear, which is available on Atmel's website at www.atmel.com.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTIONS
     2.1 On July 25, 2006, Atmel announced that its audit committee had initiated an independent investigation "regarding the timing of Atmel stock option grants." The investigation covered Atmel's stock option grants between March 19, 1991, and August 3, 2006. In June 2007, Atmel restated its financial statements for the periods between 1993 and 2005 by approximately $116 million.
     2.2 On July 27, 2006, James Juengling filed a derivative action in the Federal Court against certain current and former officers and directors of Atmel (Action No. C06-04592). Three additional derivative actions were filed in the same court by Anthony Noble (Action No. C06-4973), Kenneth Kelley (Action No. C06-04680), and Patrick McWeeny (Action No. C08-01031).

appointed lead plaintiffs, and Barroway Topaz Kessler Meltzer & Check, LLP, and Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz, LLP, were appointed co-lead plaintiffs' counsel in the Federal Action.
     2.3 On November 3, 2006, plaintiffs in the Federal Action filed a consolidated complaint. The complaint alleged that the individual defendants violated accounting rules, company policy, federal securities law, and state law "by intentionally manipulating Atmel stock option grants between February 1994 and April 2003." The complaint alleged that the individual defendants backdated stock option grants, made false and misleading statements in Form 10-Ks, Form 10-Qs, proxy statements, and Form 4s in order to conceal the backdating, engaged in insider trading, and engaged in other conduct leading to Atmel's June 2007 restatement. The Federal Action brought federal securities claims under Sections 14(a), 20(a), 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act. It also brought claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, unjust enrichment, constructive fraud, corporate waste, breach of contract, and violation of California Corporations Code section 25402.
     2.4 On July 26, 2006, Mark Perlmutter filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, against certain current and former officers and directors of Atmel (Action No. 106-CV-068049). On August 18, 2006, Govind Basnet filed a shareholder derivative action in the same court (Action No. 106-CV-068049). On September 29, 2006, Lawrence William Dunst, George S. Graham, Jr., Betty M. Larkin, and Victor Sands filed a shareholder derivative action in the same court (Action No. 106-CV-072097). These actions were consolidated as Case No. 106-CV-068049. On February 20, 2007, Mark Perlmutter was appointed lead plaintiff and the law firm of Robbins Umeda LLP was appointed lead counsel in the California Derivative Action. On April 23, 2007, the plaintiffs in the California Derivative Action filed a consolidated complaint.
     2.5 The California Derivative Action consolidated complaint alleged that certain current and former officers and directors engaged in a "scheme dating back to at least 1993 and continuing to at least 2005, whereby defendants caused or allowed Atmel insiders to manipulate their stock-option grant dates so as to secretly maximize their profits from the stock options."

The complaint also alleged that defendants violated corporate policies, accounting rules, and California state law by engaging in stock option backdating and springloading, by making false and misleading statements in Form 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs in order to conceal stock option manipulation, and by engaging in other conduct leading to Atmel's June 2007 restatement. The complaint also alleged that, between 1996 and 2005, certain defendants engaged in illegal insider trading. The California Derivative Complaint brought common law claims for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, corporate waste, accounting, rescission, and constructive trust. It also brought statutory claims pursuant to California Corporations Code sections 25402 and 25403.
     2.6 On May 10, 2007, Marilyn Poulos and Lawrence Zucker made a demand on Atmel's board under California Corporations Code section 1601 to inspect documents related to stock option backdating. On October 9, 2007, Marilyn Poulos brought a verified petition for writ of mandate to compel inspection and copying of books, records, and documents of Atmel in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara (Case No. 107-CV-095929).
     2.7 On June 23, 2008, James and Jane Golden made a demand on Atmel's board for production of certain books and records pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. On February 5, 2009, the Goldens filed a complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, pursuant to 8 Del. C. section 220, to compel inspection of Atmel's books and records.
     2.8 On May 21, 2008, Govind Basnet filed a request to dismiss his California derivative action without prejudice. This request was entered on May 2, 2008. On May 21, 2008, Govind Basnet made a demand on Atmel's board of directors for appointment of an independent committee to investigate (a) the "involvement" of the defendants in Atmel's "financial reporting process and granting of stock options"; (b) "all stock options and any other compensation paid to [the defendants]"; (c) "the amount of damages sustained by [Atmel] as a result of the [defendants'] breaches of fiduciary duty"; (d) possible insider trading; and (e) "all costs to [Atmel] associated with the various investigations of the Company."

     2.9 On February 27, 2009, Mr. Basnet filed the Delaware Derivative Action (Civil Action No. 4399-CC) alleging that Atmel's board members had violated their fiduciary duties by failing to respond appropriately to his demand and by failing to take appropriate steps "to recover the damages Atmel suffered from the Individuals who engaged directly in a scheme to grant backdated stock options."
     2.10 In September 2008 the Parties began to engage in settlement discussions. On September 22, 2008, Atmel provided the Federal Plaintiffs with non-public documents in anticipation of an October 24, 2008 mediation. Atmel has subsequently provided to both the Federal Plaintiffs and State Plaintiffs nearly 200,000 pages of documents.
     2.11 On September 23, 2008, and on October 7, 2008, after reviewing both public and non-public documents produced by Atmel, Federal Plaintiffs' Counsel sent letters to counsel for Atmel demanding certain monetary relief and corporate therapeutics.
     2.12 On October 24, 2008 and November 18, 2008, the Parties participated in two all-day, in-person mediations with the Honorable Layn R. Phillips (Ret.).
     2.13 Over the next several months, the Parties continued to engage in extensive arm's-length settlement discussions, during which the issues were thoroughly discussed in a frank exchange of views on the merits of the claims and defenses. Plaintiffs' Counsel conferred with Counsel for Defendants on multiple occasions to discuss monetary relief and corporate governance reforms.
     2.14 On April 6, 2009, the Parties participated in a third all-day, in-person mediation with Judge Phillips. After the third mediation, the Parties continued their negotiations with the assistance of Judge Phillips.
     2.15 Notwithstanding these efforts, in June 2009 the Parties reached an impasse. The Parties began to proceed with litigation and with discovery.
     2.16 In October and November 2009, the Parties met and conferred in an effort to bridge their differences and come to a resolution of the Actions. They discussed and negotiated the material terms of a possible settlement.

     2.17 As a result of these lengthy, arm's-length settlement discussions, and with the substantial assistance of Judge Phillips as mediator, the Plaintiffs and the Settling Defendants have agreed to settle the Actions on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Judge Phillips is familiar with the principal terms of this Agreement and has recommended to the Settling Parties that they settle the Actions on these terms.
     
3. BENEFITS OF THE SETTLEMENT
     3.1 Plaintiffs believe that the claims they have asserted in the Actions on behalf of Atmel have merit. However, Plaintiffs' Counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Actions against the Settling Defendants through trial and through appeals. Plaintiffs' Counsel have also taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as the Actions, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Plaintiffs' Counsel are also mindful of the inherent problems of proof and possible defenses to the claims asserted in the Actions, or that may be asserted. Based on their evaluation, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' Counsel have determined that the settlement set forth in the Agreement is in the best interests of the Plaintiffs, Atmel, and Current Atmel Shareholders. Plaintiffs' Counsel believe that the Settlement set forth in the Agreement confers substantial benefits upon Atmel and Current Atmel Shareholders.
     3.2 Settling Defendants have indicated their intent to vigorously contest each and every claim in the Actions. Settling Defendants have consistently maintained that they acted in accordance with governing laws at all times and that they had no involvement in the alleged wrongdoing. Settling Defendants contend that they have also compiled testimony and documentary evidence from which they are prepared to demonstrate that they had no involvement in the alleged wrongdoing. In addition, there has been no finding whatsoever, by any court or agency, of any wrongdoing of any kind on Settling Defendants' part.
     3.3 Settling Defendants nonetheless have concluded that it is in their best interests that the Actions be settled on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Settling Defendants reached that conclusion after considering the factual and legal issues in the Actions,

the substantial benefits to Settling Defendants and to Atmel of a final resolution of the Actions, the recommendations of Judge Phillips, the expense that would be necessary to defend the Actions through trial and through any appeals that might be taken, the benefits of disposing of protracted and complex litigation, and the desire of Settling Defendants to conduct their business unhampered by the distractions of continued litigation. Settling Defendants believe the Agreement confers substantial benefits upon Atmel and Current Atmel Shareholders.
     
4. NO ADMISSION OF FAULT, LIABILITY, OR WRONGDOING

"We are pleased to have delivered revenue growth and gross profit expansion that exceeded the upper end of our guidance range this quarter, as demand strengthened and factory utilizations improved," said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Microcontroller sales of 8- and 32-bit products, as well as our capacitive touch solutions, grew strongly as we continued to outperform the market. Based on our solid design win momentum and booking activity we are excited about the outlook for 2010, particularly for our microcontroller and touch products."
Loss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $71.8 million, which included an asset impairment charge of $79.8 million. This compares to a loss from operations of $14.7 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $18.2 million for the year-ago quarter. For the full year, loss from operations was $124.6 million, compared to $13.9 million for 2008.
Stock-based compensation expense was $10.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $7.6 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $9.1 million for the year-ago quarter. For the full year, stock-based compensation totaled $30.1 million, compared to $29.1 million for 2008.
Income tax provision totaled $4.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. This compares to an income tax provision of $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2009 and a provision of $3.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, income tax benefit was $32.9 million, primarily due to certain foreign R&D credits that the Company realized in the first and second quarters of 2009. This compares to an income tax provision of $7.0 million for 2008.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company recorded an out-of-period expense of $4.8 million for tax reserves related to withholding tax on deemed dividends associated with certain foreign intercompany loans.
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $55.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $59.4 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $33.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2008. Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $476.1 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009, an increase of $30.0 million from the end of the prior quarter. During 2009, the Company repaid $45.0 million of its revolving credit facility.
The Company's effective average exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was approximately $1.48 to the euro, compared to $1.41 to the euro in the third quarter of 2009 and $1.35 to the euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 increase in the dollar/euro exchange rate decreases operating income by approximately $0.2 million each quarter.

Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP shares
used in diluted net income (loss) per share calculations:
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense.
 - 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges.
 - 
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Charges for grant repayments.
 - 
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
 
Restructuring charges.
 - 
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Asset impairment charges
 - 
The Company records an impairment charge, when certain criteria are met, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these non-cash charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Pension benefit related to fab sale.
 - 
Pension benefit related to the reduction of pension liability and the release of related accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Heilbronn, Germany. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Gain on sale of assets.
 - 
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Distributor bad debt recovery.
 - 
Distributor bad debt recovery related to a reserve and subsequent partial collection for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the Company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this recovery from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Unsolicited M&A expense.
 - 
The Company incurred certain expenses to advise the Company concerning the take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these expenses from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations. In the third quarter, the Company incurred approximately $1.0 million of unsolicited M&A expense related to a class-action derivative lawsuit settlement.
Income tax effect of non-GAAP items.
 - 
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.

Fiscal 2010 Executive Bonus Plan
     On April 22, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an executive bonus plan for fiscal year 2010. The executive bonus plan is an incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the Company's financial and other performance objectives, and to reward them for their achievements when those objectives are met. All of the Company's executive officers pursuant to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain other employees of the Company, are eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan (individually, a "Participant," and collectively, the "Participants"). Target bonuses for Participants range from 25% to 125% of a Participant's annual base salary, and the amount of the target bonus actually paid to a Participant will be based on the achievement of (i) certain Company performance objectives related to the Company's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit as compared to the Company's annual operating plan, (ii) certain individual performance objectives approved by the Compensation Committee, and (iii) for some Participants, certain business unit objectives tied to the business unit's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit, or certain objectives tied to sales region billings. Achievement of each such factor will be measured independently, and a threshold for each factor must be met for any credit to be given to that factor. Awards will be prorated between threshold and target performance and target and stretch performance. The actual bonuses payable for fiscal year 2010, if any, could range from zero to 200% of a Participant's bonus target and will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce or increase the bonus that would otherwise be payable based on actual performance. However, no bonuses will be paid under the executive bonus plan if the Company does not achieve an annual non-GAAP operating profit (excluding the impact of items such as stock-based compensation, restructuring and asset impairment changes, certain acquisition- and divestiture-related charges and expenses and certain legal and accounting expenses). The aggregate amount of bonuses payable under the executive bonus plan to Participants would be approximately $4.6 million at target performance; the aggregate maximum amount of bonuses payable to Participants would be approximately $9.2 million.

Exhibit 99.1
 Atmel(R) Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
SAN JOSE, Calif., May 4, 2010
Revenues in the first quarter of 2010 were $348.6 million, up 1.4 percent from $343.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and up 28.4 percent from the $271.5 million reported in the first quarter of 2009.
Net income, on a GAAP basis, was $16.6 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. This compares with a GAAP net loss of $83.3 million or a loss of $0.18 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a net income of $3.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.
Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2010 totaled $25.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with a non-GAAP net income of $11.3 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a non-GAAP net income of $20.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.
Gross margin increased to 38.4 percent in the first quarter of 2010, up from 37.0 percent in the fourth quarter and 35.1 percent in the first quarter of 2009. The sequential gross margin improvement was the result of increased factory utilization levels and an improved mix of higher margin microcontroller products during the quarter.
"We are especially pleased to have achieved record revenues for our microcontroller business," said Steve Laub, president and chief executive officer. "Our Microcontroller and Touch solutions continue to gain substantial design wins, and we expect robust growth for these products throughout the year," he said.
 
Income from operations in the first quarter of 2010 was $14.9 million, compared with a fourth quarter loss of $71.8 million, which included an asset impairment charge of $79.8 million. This compares with a loss from operations of $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2009.
Stock-based compensation expense was $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $10.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $5.4 million in the first quarter of 2009.
Income tax provision totaled $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with an income tax provision of $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and an income tax benefit of $27.7 million in the first quarter of 2009. The income tax benefit for the first quarter of 2009 was the result of the release of reserves related to certain foreign R&D tax credits that the company realized in the quarter.
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $55.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $5.6 million in the first quarter of 2009. Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $521.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2010, an increase of $45.1 million from the end of the prior quarter.
The company's effective average exchange rate in the first quarter of 2010 was approximately $1.42 to the Euro, compared with $1.48 to the Euro in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $1.32 to the Euro in the year-ago period. A $0.01 change in the dollar/Euro exchange rate changes operating income by approximately $0.3 million each quarter.

Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related (credits) charges include: (1) in-process research and development, which relates to projects in process as of the acquisition date that have not reached technological feasibility and are immediately expensed, (2) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement, and (3) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure- related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
The Company records an impairment charge, when certain criteria are met, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these non-cash charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Distributor bad debt recovery related to a reserve and subsequent partial collection for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the Company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this recovery from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
The Company incurred certain expenses to advise the Company concerning the take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these expenses from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.

Participation
 
6.  .
Contributions
 
(a)  At the time a Participant enrolls in the Plan pursuant to Section 5, he or she will elect to have payroll deductions made on each pay day or other Contributions (to the extent permitted by the Administrator) made during the Offering Period in an amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) and not less than two percent (2%) of the Compensation, which he or she receives on each pay day during the Offering Period; provided, however, that should a pay day occur on an Exercise Date or within eight (8) days prior thereto, a Participant will have any payroll deductions made on such day applied to his or her account under the subsequent Purchase Period or Offering Period. The Administrator, in its sole discretion, may permit Participants in a specified Offering to contribute amounts to the Plan through payment by cash, check or other means change the maximum and minimum percentages of Compensation that may be contributed to the Plan for that Offering Period. A Participant's subscription agreement will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods unless terminated as provided in Section 10 hereof.
and/or
 
(b)  Payroll deductions for a Participant will commence on the first pay day following the Enrollment Date and will end on the last pay day prior to the Exercise Date of such Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, except as provided in Section 6(a) and 6(d) and subject to earlier termination by the Participant as provided in Section 10.
 
(c)  All Contributions made for a Participant will be credited to his or her account under the Plan and payroll deductions will be made in whole percentages only. A Participant may not make any additional payments into such account.
 
(d)  A Participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided in Section 10, or may increase or decrease the rate of his or her Contributions during the Offering Period by (i) properly completing and submitting to the Company's stock administration office (or its designee), on or before a date determined by the Administrator prior to an applicable Exercise Date, a new subscription agreement authorizing the change in Contribution rate in the form provided by the Administrator for such purpose, or (ii) following an electronic or other procedure prescribed by the Administrator. If a Participant has not followed such procedures to change the rate of Contributions, the rate of his or her Contributions will continue at the originally elected rate throughout the Offering Period and future Offering Periods (unless terminated as provided in Section 10). Any elections under the Plan shall be effective only if made in accordance with such procedures as the Administrator may establish from time to time. For example, but not by way of limitation, the Administrator may, in its sole discretion, limit the nature number of Contribution rate changes that may be made by Participants during any Offering Period, establish different deadlines for making elections rules for when Contributions will be included in a particular Offering Period, establish such other conditions or limitations as it deems appropriate for Plan administration.
and/or
and/or
and/or
 
(e)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b), a Participant's Contributions may be decreased to zero percent (0%) at any time during a Purchase Period. Subject to Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b) hereof, Contributions will recommence at the rate originally elected by the Participant effective as of the beginning of the first Purchase Period scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10.
 
(f)  At the time the option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time some or all of the Common Stock issued under the Plan is disposed of (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan
 
occurs), the Participant must make adequate provision for the Company's or Employer's federal, state, local or any other tax liability payable to any authority including taxes imposed by jurisdictions outside of the U.S., national insurance, social security or other tax withholding obligations, if any, which arise upon the exercise of the option or the disposition of the Common Stock (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs). At any time, the Company or the Employer may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the Participant's Compensation the amount necessary for the Company or the Employer to meet applicable withholding obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company or the Employer any tax deductions or benefits attributable to sale or early disposition of Common Stock by the Eligible Employee. In addition, the Company or the Employer may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the proceeds of the sale of Common Stock or any other method of withholding the Company or the Employer deems appropriate to the extent permitted by U.S. Treasury
Regulation Section 1.423-2(f).
 
7.  .  On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each Eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period will be granted an option to purchase on each Exercise Date during such Offering Period (at the applicable Purchase Price) up to a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing such Eligible Employee's Contributions accumulated prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Eligible Employee's account as of the Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price; provided that in no event will an Eligible Employee be permitted to purchase during each Offering Period more than fifteen thousand (15,000) shares of the Company's Common Stock (or such other limit as the Administrator may establish from time to time). The Eligible Employee may accept the grant of such option with respect to an Offering Period by electing to participate in the Plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 5. The Administrator may, for future Offering Periods, increase or decrease, in its absolute discretion, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that an Eligible Employee may purchase during each Purchase Period of an Offering Period. Exercise of the option will occur as provided in Section 8, unless the Participant has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10. The option will expire on the last day of the Offering Period.
Grant of Option
 
8.  .
Exercise of Option
 
(a)  Unless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10, his or her option for the purchase of shares of Common Stock will be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full shares subject to the option will be purchased for such Participant at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated Contributions from his or her account. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be purchased; any Contributions accumulated in a Participant's account, which are not sufficient to purchase a full share will be returned to the Participant. Any other funds left over in a Participant's account after the Exercise Date will be returned to the Participant. During a Participant's lifetime, a Participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her.
 
(b)  If the Administrator determines that, on a given Exercise Date, the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which options are to be exercised may exceed (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that were available for sale under the Plan on the Enrollment Date of the applicable Offering Period, or (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock available for sale under the Plan on such Exercise Date, the Administrator may in its sole discretion (x) provide that the Company will make a pro rata allocation of the shares of Common Stock available for purchase on such Enrollment Date or Exercise Date, as applicable, in as uniform a manner as will be practicable and as it will determine in its sole discretion to be equitable among all Participants exercising options to purchase Common Stock on such Exercise Date, and continue all Offering Periods then in effect or (y) provide that the Company will make a pro rata allocation of the shares available for purchase on such Enrollment Date or Exercise Date, as applicable, in as uniform a manner as will be practicable and as it will determine in its sole discretion to be equitable among all participants exercising options to purchase Common Stock on such Exercise Date, and terminate any or all Offering Periods then in effect pursuant to Section 20. The Company may make a pro rata allocation of the shares available on the Enrollment Date of any applicable Offering Period pursuant to the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any authorization of additional shares for issuance under the Plan by the Company's stockholders subsequent to such Enrollment Date.
 
9.  .  As soon as reasonably practicable after each Exercise Date on which a purchase of shares of Common Stock occurs, the Company will arrange the delivery to each Participant of the shares purchased
Delivery
 
upon exercise of his or her option in a form determined by the Administrator (in its sole discretion) and pursuant to rules established by the Administrator. The Company may permit or require that shares be deposited directly with a broker designated by the Company or to a designated agent of the Company, and the Company may utilize electronic or automated methods of share transfer. The Company may require that shares be retained with such broker or agent for a designated period of time may establish other procedures to permit tracking of disqualifying dispositions of such shares. No Participant will have any voting, dividend, or other stockholder rights with respect to shares of Common Stock subject to any option granted under the Plan until such shares have been purchased and delivered to the Participant as provided in this Section 9.
and/or
 
10.  .
Withdrawal
 
(a)  A Participant may withdraw all but not less than all the Contributions credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his or her option under the Plan by submitting a withdrawal notice in the form and manner and in accordance with such procedures as the Administrator may specify from time to time. All of the Participant's Contributions credited to his or her account will be paid to such Participant promptly after the notice of withdrawal becomes effective and if timely, such Participant's option for the Offering Period will be automatically terminated, and no further Contributions for the purchase of shares will be made for such Offering Period. If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, Contributions will not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Offering Period, unless the Participant re-enrolls in the Plan in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.
 
(b)  A Participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan that may hereafter be adopted by the Company or in succeeding Offering Periods that commence after the termination of the Offering Period from which the Participant withdraws.
 
11. .  Upon a Participant's ceasing to be an Eligible Employee, for any reason, he or she will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the Contributions credited to such Participant's account during the Offering Period but not yet used to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan will be returned to such Participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 15, and such Participant's option will be automatically terminated.
Termination of Employment
 
12. .  No interest will accrue on the Contributions of a participant in the Plan, except as may be required by applicable law, as determined by the Company, and if so required by the laws of a particular jurisdiction, shall apply to all Participants in the relevant Offering except to the extent otherwise permitted by U.S. Treasury
Interest
Regulation Section 1.423-2(f).
 
13. .

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION
     2.1 On July 25, 2006, Atmel announced that its audit committee had initiated an independent investigation "regarding the timing of Atmel stock option grants."

Three additional derivative actions were filed in the same court by Anthony Noble (Action No. C06-4973), Kenneth Kelley (Action No. C06-04680), and Patrick McWeeny (Action No. C08-01031). On October 4, 2006, these actions were consolidated under the caption ., Master File No. CV 06-4592-JF.

In re Atmel Corp. Derivative Litig
     2.3 On November 3, 2006, plaintiffs in the Federal Action filed a consolidated complaint, which was later amended to include James Michael Ross as a defendant. The complaint alleged that the individual defendants violated accounting rules, company policy, federal securities law, and state law "by intentionally manipulating Atmel stock option grants between February 1994 and April 2003." The complaint alleged that the individual defendants backdated stock option grants, made false and misleading statements in Form 10-Ks, Form 10-Qs, proxy statements, and Form 4s in order to conceal the backdating, engaged in insider trading, and engaged in other conduct leading to Atmel's June 2007 restatement. The Federal Action brought federal securities claims under Sections 14(a), 20(a), 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the
 
Securities Exchange Act. It also brought claims for breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting, unjust enrichment, constructive fraud, corporate waste, breach of contract, and violation of California Corporations Code section 25402.
     2.4 On July 26, 2006, Mark Perlmutter filed a shareholder derivative action in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, against certain current and former officers and directors of Atmel (Action No. 106-CV-068049). On August 18, 2006, Govind Basnet filed a shareholder derivative action in the same court (Action No. 106-CV-068049). On September 29, 2006, Lawrence William Dunst, George S. Graham, Jr., Betty M. Larkin, and Victor Sands filed a shareholder derivative action in the same court (Action No. 106-CV-072097). These actions were consolidated as Case No. 106-CV-068049. On February 20, 2007, Mark Perlmutter was appointed lead plaintiff and the law firm of Robbins Umeda LLP was appointed lead counsel in the California Derivative Action. On April 23, 2007, the plaintiffs in the California Derivative Action filed a consolidated complaint.
     2.5 The California Derivative Action consolidated complaint alleged that certain current and former officers and directors engaged in a "scheme dating back to at least 1993 and continuing to at least 2005, whereby defendants caused or allowed Atmel insiders to manipulate their stock-option grant dates so as to secretly maximize their profits from the stock options." The complaint also alleged that defendants violated corporate policies, accounting rules, and California state law by engaging in stock option backdating and springloading, by making false and misleading statements in Form 10-Ks and Form 10-Qs in order to conceal stock option manipulation, and by engaging in other conduct leading to Atmel's June 2007 restatement. The complaint also alleged that, between 1996 and 2005, certain defendants engaged in illegal insider trading. The California Derivative Complaint brought common law claims for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, corporate waste, accounting, rescission, and constructive trust. It also brought statutory claims pursuant to California Corporations Code sections 25402 and 25403.
     2.6 In September 2008, the parties began to engage in settlement discussions. Atmel subsequently provided the parties with nearly 250,000 pages of documents.
 
     2.7 On September 23, 2008, and on October 7, 2008, after reviewing both public and non-public documents produced by Atmel, Federal Plaintiffs' Counsel sent letters to counsel for Atmel demanding certain monetary relief and corporate therapeutics.
     2.8 On October 24, 2008 and November 18, 2008, the Parties participated in two all-day, in-person mediations with the Honorable Layn R. Phillips (Ret.).
     2.9 Over the next several months, the Parties continued to engage in extensive arm's-length settlement discussions, during which the issues were thoroughly discussed in a frank exchange of views on the merits of the claims and defenses. Plaintiffs' Counsel conferred with Counsel for Defendants on multiple occasions to discuss monetary relief and corporate governance reforms.
     2.10 On April 6, 2009, the Parties participated in a third all-day, in-person mediation with Judge Phillips. After the third mediation, the Parties continued their negotiations with the assistance of Judge Phillips.
     2.11 Notwithstanding these efforts, in June 2009 the Parties reached an impasse. The Parties began to proceed with litigation and with discovery.
     2.12 In October and November 2009, the Parties met and conferred in an effort to bridge their differences and come to a resolution of the Actions. They discussed and negotiated the material terms of a possible settlement.
     2.13 As a result of these lengthy, arm's-length settlement discussions, and with the substantial assistance of Judge Phillips as mediator, the parties to this Action and the California Derivative Action, other than Defendant, entered into a Settlement Agreement, which received final approval by the Court on March 31, 2010.
     2.14 Pursuant to the Settlement approved on March 31, 2010, Atmel (i) received a direct financial benefit of $9.65 million; (ii) agreed to adopt and/or implement of a variety of corporate governance enhancements, particularly in the way Atmel grants and documents grants of employee stock option awards; (iii) agreed to pay Plaintiffs' counsels' attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in the amount of $4.94 million; and (iv) received releases of all the settling
 
defendants, and the dismissal with prejudice of all the derivative actions, except as against the Defendant.
     2.15 After extensive negotiations among the Parties, and Atmel's insurers, the Parties have reached an agreement for the settlement of the Action on the terms set forth in this Agreement.
     
3. BENEFITS OF THE SETTLEMENT
     3.1 Plaintiffs believe that the claims they have asserted against the Defendant in the Action on behalf of Atmel have merit. However, Plaintiffs' Counsel recognize and acknowledge the expense and length of continued proceedings necessary to prosecute the Action against Defendant through trial and through appeals. Plaintiffs' Counsel have also taken into account the uncertain outcome and the risk of any litigation, especially in complex actions such as this one, as well as the difficulties and delays inherent in such litigation. Plaintiffs' Counsel are also mindful of the inherent problems of proof and possible defenses to the claims asserted in the Action, or that may be asserted. Based on their evaluation, Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' Counsel have determined that the settlement set forth in the Agreement is in the best interests of the Plaintiffs, Atmel, and Current Atmel Shareholders. Plaintiffs' Counsel believe that the Settlement set forth in the Agreement confers substantial benefits upon Atmel and Current Atmel Shareholders.
     3.2 Defendant has indicated his intent to vigorously contest each and every claim in the Action. Defendant has consistently maintained that he acted in accordance with governing laws at all times and that he had no involvement in the alleged wrongdoing. Defendant contends that he has also compiled testimony and documentary evidence from which he is prepared to demonstrate that he had no involvement in the alleged wrongdoing. In addition, there has been no finding whatsoever, by any court or agency, of any wrongdoing of any kind on Defendant's part.
     3.3 Defendant nonetheless has concluded that it is in his best interests that the Action be settled on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Defendant reached that conclusion after considering the factual and legal issues in the Action, the substantial benefits to
 
Defendant of a final resolution of the Action, the expense that would be necessary to defend the Action through trial and through any appeals that might be taken, the benefits of disposing of protracted and complex litigation, and the desire of Defendant to conduct his business unhampered by the distractions of continued litigation.
     
4. NO ADMISSION OF FAULT, LIABILITY, OR WRONGDOING
     4.1 Defendant enters into this Agreement without in any way acknowledging any personal fault, liability, or wrongdoing of any kind. Defendant continues vigorously to deny all of the material allegations in the Action, and asserts that all claims in the Action are completely without merit.
     4.2 Neither this Agreement, nor any of its terms or provisions, nor any of the negotiations or proceedings connected with it, shall be construed as an admission or concession by Defendant of the truth of any of the allegations in the Action, or of any liability, fault, or wrongdoing of any kind.
     4.3 Neither this Agreement, nor any of its terms or provisions, nor any of the negotiations or proceedings connected with it, shall be referred to, offered as evidence, or received in evidence in any pending or future civil, criminal, or administrative action or proceeding, except in a proceeding to enforce this Agreement, to defend against the assertion of the Settled Claims, or as otherwise required by law.
     
5. CONSIDERATION FOR SETTLEMENT OF THE ACTION
     5.1 Atmel has reached agreements with its first and second excess directors and officers insurers that they will, within ten days after entry of the Preliminary Order, make the following payments to Atmel:
     Atmel estimates that, after reimbursement of its fees and disbursements, the net benefit to Atmel of this Agreement will be approximately $1.7 million.
 
     
6. ORDER APPROVING NOTICE OF PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND SETTING SETTLEMENT HEARING
     6.1 Federal Plaintiffs' Counsel agree to apply to the Federal Court for entry of a Preliminary Order, substantially in the form of Exhibit A to this Agreement, as soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement.
     
7. FINAL JUDGMENT AND ORDER OF DISMISSAL OF THE ACTION

     7.2 Within ten days after entry of the Final Federal Judgment, Defendant shall seek dismissal without prejudice of the Delaware Action and shall use his best efforts to secure the dismissal.
     
8. RELEASES
     8.1 As of the Effective Date, Atmel, the Plaintiffs (individually and derivatively on behalf of Atmel and all Current Atmel Shareholders), and the Defendant shall be deemed to have, and by operation of the Final Federal Judgment shall have, fully, finally, and forever released and discharged the Released Persons from all Settled Claims and from all claims arising out of or relating to the defense, settlement, or resolution of the Action as against the Defendant.

Exhibit 99.1
 Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2010.
SAN JOSE, Calif., August 4, 2010
Revenues in the second quarter of 2010 were $393.4 million, up 13 percent from $348.5 million in the first quarter of 2010 and up 38 percent from $284.5 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Net loss, on a GAAP basis, was $36.4 million or $(0.08) per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. Included in net loss for the quarter were charges related to the sale of the company's manufacturing operations in Rousset, France of $107.6 million. The second quarter net loss compares with a GAAP net income of $16.6 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 and a net loss of $12.4 million or $(0.03) per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.
Non-GAAP net income in the second quarter of 2010 totaled $50.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $25.5 million or $0.05 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010 and non-GAAP net loss of $(0.6) million or $(0.00) per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009.
Gross margin increased to 41 percent in the second quarter of 2010, the highest level achieved since the fourth quarter of 2000, compared to 38 percent in the first quarter of 2010 and 32 percent in the second quarter of 2009. The sequential gross margin improvement was the result of higher business volumes, increased factory utilization levels, and an improved mix as greater than half of all product shipments during the quarter were higher margin microcontroller products.
 
"Our transformation to a higher growth and higher margin company is reflected in our increased revenues, improved gross margin, and strong cash flow from operations. We continue to build momentum in the microcontroller and touch businesses with increased design wins, particularly for our maXTouch solutions," said Steve Laub, President and Chief Executive Officer of Atmel. "We are also pleased to have achieved two major strategic milestones during the second quarter with the closing of the sale of our wafer manufacturing operations in Rousset, France, and the execution of a definitive agreement for the sale of our Smart Card business."
Second quarter 2010 loss from operations of $(78.9) million compared with first quarter income from operations of $14.9 million and a loss from operations of $(17.6) million in the second quarter of 2009. The sale of the manufacturing operations in Rousset resulted in a loss on the sale of assets as well as related restructuring and impairment charges totaling $107.6 million
Stock-based compensation expense was $21.7 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2010 and $6.4 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Income tax benefit totaled $39.7 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared to an income tax provision of $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2010 and an income tax benefit of $9.7 million in the second quarter of 2009. The income tax benefit for the second quarter of 2010 was the result of discrete tax benefits related to the taxable losses from the Rousset fab transaction and related changes to deferred tax liabilities.
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $49.2 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with $70.4 million in the first quarter of 2010 and $1.6 million in the second quarter of 2009. Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $552.2 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010, an increase of $31.0 million from the end of the prior quarter, and the company had a record net cash balance (cash balances less the current and long-term debt) of $468.6 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010.
The company's effective average exchange rate in the second quarter of 2010 was approximately $1.31 to the Euro, compared with $1.42 to the Euro in the first quarter of 2010 and $1.33 to the Euro in the year-ago period. During the second quarter 2010 a $0.01 decrease in the Euro/dollar exchange rate increased operating income by $0.2 million.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net (Loss) Income to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges (credits) include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
Atmel records an impairment charge, when certain criteria are met, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Management believes that is it is appropriate to exclude these non-cash charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes losses (gains) resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic business assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Pension charge related to the release of related accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Rousset, France and the transfer of employees to the fab buyer. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Distributor bad debt recovery related to a reserve and subsequent partial collection for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this recovery from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
The company incurred certain expenses to advise the company concerning the take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these expenses from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.
 
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect of deferred tax valuation allowance provision or reversal. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude deferred tax valuation allowance provision or reversal amounts from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.

Exhibit 99.1
 Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2010.
SAN JOSE, Calif., November 4, 2010
Revenues in the third quarter of 2010 were $444.3 million, up 13 percent from $393.4 million in the second quarter of 2010 and up 40 percent from $317.7 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Net income on a GAAP basis was $219.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010. Included in net income for the third quarter was a significant tax benefit from the settlement of an IRS tax audit of $150.4 million. The third quarter net income compares with a GAAP net loss of $36.4 million or a loss of $(0.08) per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010 and a net loss of $17.5 million or a loss of $(0.04) per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009.
Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter of 2010 totaled $88.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $50.8 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010 and a non-GAAP net loss of $4.0 million or a loss of $(0.01) per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009.
Gross margin increased to 47 percent in the third quarter of 2010, the highest level achieved since the fourth quarter of 1996, compared to 41 percent in the second quarter of 2010 and 31 percent in the third quarter of 2009. The sequential gross margin improvement was the result of the sale during the second quarter of the Rousset manufacturing operations, increased factory utilization levels, and a favorable mix of higher margin microcontroller products.
 
"The strong financial results are a reflection of our outstanding product portfolio, streamlined manufacturing operations and our focus on growing higher margin businesses. Our microcontroller business achieved record revenues again in the third quarter and gained substantial market share as our products continue to be the preferred choice among design engineers. Atmel's touchscreen shipments experienced a particularly strong ramp as customers continue to demand the superior performance offered by our maXTouch products," said Steve Laub, President and Chief Executive Officer of Atmel. "Additionally, we are pleased to have completed the sale of the Smart Card business increasing our focus on our core microcontroller business."
Third quarter 2010 income from operations of $77.7 million compared with a second quarter loss from operations of $78.9 million and a loss from operations of $14.7 million in the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter income from operations included a $5.7 million loss from the sale of the Smart Card business.
Stock-based compensation expense was $13.2 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $21.7 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Income tax benefit of $136.6 million in the third quarter of 2010 included a $150.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, tax benefit from the settlement of an IRS tax audit resulting from the release of tax reserves of approximately $102.0 million, plus a $48.4 million tax refund. This compares to an income tax benefit of $39.7 million in the second quarter of 2010 and an income tax provision of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $95.3 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $49.2 million in the second quarter of 2010, and $59.4 million in the third quarter of 2009. Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $597.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2010, an increase of $45.1 million from the end of the prior quarter, and the company had a record net cash balance (cash balances less the current and long-term debt) of $513.3 million at the end of third quarter 2010.

Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect the information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes.

In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results.

Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade name and non-compete agreement and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these costs are not incurred on an on-going basis, consistent with restructuring charges and other non-recurring types of charges included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities and such costs have not historically occurred in each year. Although Atmel has engaged in various
 
restructuring activities in the past, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel records an impairment charge, when certain criteria are met, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Management believes that is it is appropriate to exclude these non-cash charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes losses (gains) resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are one-time in nature and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Pension charge related to the release of related accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Rousset, France and the transfer of employees to the fab buyer. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Distributor bad debt recovery related to a reserve and subsequent partial collection for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this recovery from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
The company incurred certain expenses for corporate advisors related to the 2009 take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. and ON Semiconductor Corporation. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these expenses from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.
Atmel adjusts for unusual or one-time tax items. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these items from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.

(d) Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2010.
SAN JOSE, CA, February 8, 2011 
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $457.8 million, a 3% increase compared to $444.3 million for the third quarter of 2010, and a 33% increase compared to $343.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter results for 2010 exclude the Smart Card business which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2010. Adjusting for the Smart Card divestiture, fourth quarter revenues increased 10% sequentially and 44% from the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the full year 2010, revenues increased 35% to $1.64 billion, compared to $1.22 billion for 2009.
Net income, on a GAAP basis, totaled $223.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010. Included in fourth quarter 2010 results was a tax benefit of $133.1 million, which included $118.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, primarily from releasing reserves for certain deferred tax assets. The fourth quarter 2010 net income compares to net income of $219.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010, which included a $150.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share tax benefit related to the resolution of an IRS tax audit, and a net loss of $83.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter, including one-time charges. For the full year of 2010, net income was $423.1 million or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $109.5 million or a loss of $0.24 per diluted share for 2009.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2010 totaled $119.5 million or $0.25 per diluted share compared to non-GAAP net income of $88.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010, and non-GAAP net income of $11.3 million or $0.02 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP results for the fourth quarter of 2010 exclude the tax benefit
 
of $118.1 million. For the full year 2010, non-GAAP net income increased 960% to $284.3 million or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $26.8 million or $0.06 per diluted share for 2009. Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
Gross margin improved to 49.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010, the highest level achieved since the third quarter of 1996. This compares to gross margin of 46.8% in the third quarter of 2010 and 37.0% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential gross profit improvement was the result of increased volumes and improved mix of higher margin products, as well as the third quarter divestiture of the Smart Card business. For the full year 2010, gross margin increased to 44.3% compared to 33.9% for 2009.
"Our fourth quarter results exceeded our expectations as we continued to experience strong customer demand and improved product mix across all business segments" said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Microcontroller revenues reached new records as both our 8-bit and 32-bit products continued to benefit from broad-based strength in the market. Atmel's market leading touchscreen solutions, led by our maXTouch products, continued their strong growth, easily surpassing our goal of $140 million in revenues during calendar 2010. We remain confident in our business with continuing design win momentum in our microcontroller products and recently announced new generation of touch solutions."
Fourth quarter income from operations improved to $93.8 million, or 20.5% of revenues, compared with $77.7 million, or 17.5% of revenues for the third quarter of 2010, and a loss from operations of $71.8 million for the fourth quarter 2009. Third quarter 2010 income from operations included a $5.7 million loss from the sale of the Smart Card business, while fourth quarter 2009 included a $79.8 million asset impairment charge. For the full year of 2010, income from operations was $107.5 million, compared to a loss of $124.6 million for 2009.
Income tax benefit totaled $133.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2010. This compares to an income tax benefit of $136.6 million for the third quarter of 2010 and a provision of $10.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, income tax benefit was $306.7 million which compares to an income tax benefit of $26.5 million for the full year of 2009. During 2010, the company favorably settled tax audits and released reserves for certain deferred tax assets which contributed $247.9 million of the total tax benefit recorded for the year.
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $84.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $95.3 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $55.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $521.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010, a decrease of $76.4 million from the end of the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the company repaid $80 million of its revolving credit facility and repurchased $48 million of common stock. Net cash balance (cash balances less current and long-term debt) was the highest in the company's history at $517.0 million at December 31, 2010.

Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP shares used in diluted net income per share calculations:
 
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized
 
compensation expense is reversed. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Grant repayments primarily relate to contractual obligations to repay incentive amounts received from various government entities recorded in prior periods (including interest) as a result of restructuring activity. Atmel excludes these amounts from non-GAAP financial measures primarily because grant repayments occur infrequently, and excluding ongoing related interest charges enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period over period operating results from continuing operations.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
When certain criteria are met, Atmel records an impairment charge for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Atmel believes that is it is appropriate to exclude these non-cash charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes losses (gains) resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these losses (gains) are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
Pension charge related to fab sale relates to pension charges associated with the release of related accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Rousset, France and the transfer of employees to the fab buyer. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from
 
Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Distributor bad debt recovery relates to a reserve and subsequent partial collection for receivables from an Asian distributor whose business was extraordinarily impacted following their addition to the US government's Entity List which prohibits the company from shipping products to the distributor. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this recovery from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
The company incurred certain expenses for corporate advisors related to the 2009 take-over bid from Microchip Technology, Inc. and ON Semiconductor Corporation. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these expenses from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel adjusts for the income tax effect resulting from the non-GAAP adjustments as described above.
Atmel adjusts for unusual or one-time tax items such as significant tax audit settlements and valuation reserve adjustments on deferred tax assets. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude these items from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.

Fiscal 2011 Executive Bonus Plan
 
On March 29, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") adopted an executive bonus plan for 2011. The executive bonus plan is an incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the Company's financial and other performance objectives and to reward them if, and when, those objectives are met. All of the Company's executive officers, including all of its officers designated as "Section 16" officers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (except for Scott Wornow, our Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, who joined the Company in November 2010, who will be entitled to receive a guaranteed fixed bonus for 2011), and other designated employees of the Company, are eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan (individually, a "Participant," and collectively, the "Participants"). Target bonuses for Participants range from 25% to 125% of a Participant's annual base salary.  The bonus actually paid to a Participant will be based on the achievement of (i) Company performance objectives related to the Company's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit as compared to the Company's annual operating plan, (ii) individual performance objectives approved by the Compensation Committee, and (iii) for some Participants, business unit objectives tied to the business unit's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit, or objectives tied to regional sales revenues. Achievement of each factor will be measured independently, and a minimum threshold for each factor must be met for any credit to be given to that factor. The Compensation Committee set a minimum threshold, target objective and stretch objective for annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit. Bonuses will be prorated between threshold and target performance and target and stretch performance. The actual bonuses payable for 2011, if any, could range from zero to 200% of a Participant's bonus target and will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce or increase the bonus that would otherwise be payable based on actual performance. No bonuses, however, will be paid under the executive bonus plan if the Company does not achieve an annual non-GAAP operating profit (excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition and divestiture related expenses, certain legal, accounting and related expenses, and other items approved by the Compensation Committee). With respect to Participants eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan as of March 29, 2011 (which may change over the course of the year), the aggregate amount of bonuses payable under the executive bonus plan to such Participants would be approximately $5.7 million at target performance, and the aggregate amount of bonuses payable to such Participants would be approximately $11.4 million at stretch performance.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SAN JOSE, CA, May 4, 2011 --
Atmel
 Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
 
Revenues for the first quarter of 2011 were $461.4 million, a 1% increase compared to $457.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, and a 32% increase compared to $348.5 million for the first quarter of 2010. First quarter 2010 results include revenues and operating results from the former Smart Card business which was divested at the end of the third quarter of 2010.  Adjusting for the Smart Card divestiture, first quarter revenues increased 43% from the first quarter of the prior year.
 
Net income, on a GAAP basis, totaled $74.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2011. Included in first quarter 2011 results were restructuring charges of $21.2 million or $0.05 per diluted share, related to personnel reductions at Rousset, France following the sale of our wafer fabrication and Smart Card businesses. The first quarter 2011 net income compares to net income of $223.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010, which included $118.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, primarily from releasing reserves for certain deferred tax assets. Net income, on a GAAP basis, was $16.6 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010.
 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2011 totaled $122.2 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $119.2 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010, and non-GAAP net income of $25.2 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.  Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
 
Gross margin improved to 51.0% in the first quarter of 2011, the highest level achieved since the company went public in 1991.  This compares to gross margin of 49.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 and 38.4% in the first quarter of 2010. The sequential gross profit improvement was the result of a more favorable mix of higher margin products and continued cost reduction activities.
 
 
"Our outstanding first quarter results, in a seasonally softer quarter, were driven by the continued success of our microcontroller business," said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "With company revenues the highest in 10 years, record gross margin and robust design activity, we are well positioned for continued success in 2011."
 
First quarter income from operations of $81.9 million or 17.7% of revenues compared with $93.8 million or 20.5% of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2010, and $14.9 million or 4.3% income from operations for the first quarter 2010. First quarter 2011 income from operations included $21.2 million of restructuring charges and a $1.9 million gain on the sale of assets while fourth quarter 2010 income from operations included a $1.6 million restructuring charge, and the first quarter of 2010 had a $1.0 million restructuring charge.
 
Income tax provision totaled $9.8 million for the first quarter of 2011. This compares to an income tax benefit of $133.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and a provision of $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2010.  The income tax benefit from fourth quarter 2010 resulted primarily from the release of tax reserves for certain deferred tax assets.
 
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $74.1 million for the first quarter of 2011, compared to $84.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2010 and $70.4 million for the first quarter of 2010.   Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $496.7 million at the end of the first quarter of 2011, a decrease of $24.3 million from the end of the prior quarter that resulted principally from the repurchase of $85 million of common stock.  Net cash balance (cash balances less current and long-term debt) was $492.3 million at March 31, 2011.

Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP shares used in 
diluted net income per share calculations:
 
 
 
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
 
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
 
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense.
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units.  This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.  Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
 
 
                 
Acquisition-related charges (credits).
 
Acquisition-related charges (credits) include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
 
                 
Restructuring charges.
 
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs.  Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Gain on sale of assets.
 
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
 
                 
Non-GAAP tax adjustment.
 
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on the Atmel's tax returns, including certain foreign refundable credits.  This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
 
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.
 
Non-GAAP tax amounts for periods prior to January 1, 2011 have not been adjusted to reflect this new methodology.

If an Award expires or becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, or, with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, is forfeited to the Company or repurchased by the Company, the unpurchased Shares (or for Awards other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, the forfeited or repurchased Shares) that were subject thereto will become available for future grant or sale under the Plan (unless the Plan has terminated). Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right settled in Shares, the gross number of Shares covered by the portion of the Award so exercised will cease to be available under the Plan. Shares that have actually been issued under the Plan under any Award will not be returned to the Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Plan; provided, however, that if unvested Shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units are repurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company, such Shares will become available for future grant under the Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an Award and/or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an Award will not become available for future grant or sale under the Plan. To the extent an Award under the Plan is paid out in cash rather than Shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(a), subject to adjustment provided in Section 16, the maximum number of Shares that may be issued upon the exercise of Incentive Stock Options will equal the aggregate Share number stated in this Section 4(a), plus, to the extent allowable under Section 422 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, any Shares that become available for issuance under the Plan under this paragraph.

No Service Provider shall be granted, in any fiscal year of the Company, Options, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units to purchase more than 5,000,000 Shares.
 
(ii)
                                 
In connection with his or her initial service, a Service Provider may be granted Options, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units to purchase up to an additional 5,000,000 Shares which shall not count against the limit set forth in subsection (i) above.
 
(iii)
                              
The foregoing limitations shall be adjusted proportionately in connection with any change in the Company's capitalization as described in Section 16.
 
(iv)
                             
If an Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Unit is cancelled in the same fiscal year of the Company in which it was granted (other than in connection with a transaction described in Section 16), the cancelled Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units will be counted against the limits set forth in subsections (i) and (ii) above. For this purpose, if the exercise price of an Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Unit is reduced, the transaction will be treated as a cancellation of the Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units and the grant of a new Option, Stock Purchase Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights or Restricted Stock Units.

In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option granted on or after April 9, 2008, except as may be required by law to ensure favorable tax treatment in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per share on the Grant Date. In the case of a Nonstatutory Stock Option intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the per Share exercise price shall be no less than 100% of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Grant Date.
(iii)

Form of Consideration
.  The Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration for exercising an Option, including the method of payment. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, the Administrator shall determine the acceptable form of consideration at the time of grant. Such consideration may consist entirely of:

Exercise of Option
.
 
(a)
                                 
Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder
.  Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable according to the terms of the Plan and at such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator and set forth in the Award Agreement. Except for options granted prior to October 11, 1996, or unless the Administrator provides otherwise, vesting of Options granted hereunder shall be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence. An Option may not be exercised for a fraction of a Share.
 
An Option shall be deemed exercised when the Company receives: (i) written or electronic notice of exercise (in accordance with the Award Agreement) from the person entitled to exercise the Option, and (ii) full payment for the Shares with respect to which the Option is exercised. Full payment may consist of any consideration and method of payment authorized by the Administrator and permitted by the Award Agreement and the Plan. Shares issued upon exercise of an Option shall be issued in the name of the Optionee or, if requested by the Optionee, in the name of the Optionee and his or her spouse. Until the Shares are issued (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company), no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder shall exist with respect to the Optioned Stock, notwithstanding the exercise of the Option. The Company shall issue (or cause to be issued) such Shares promptly after the Option is exercised. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Shares are issued, except as provided in Section 16 of the Plan.
 
Exercising an Option in any manner shall decrease the number of Shares thereafter available, both for purposes of the Plan and for sale under the Option, by the number of Shares as to which the Option is exercised.
 
(b)
                                
Termination of Relationship as a Service Provider
.  If an Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider, other than upon the Optionee's death or Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent that the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for three (3) months following the Optionee's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified by the Administrator, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
 
(c)
                                 
Disability of Optionee
.  If an Optionee ceases to be a Service Provider as a result of the Optionee's Disability, the Optionee may exercise his or her Option within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of termination (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement). In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Optionee's termination. If, on the date of termination, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall revert to the Plan. If, after termination, the Optionee does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.
 
(d)
                                
Death of Optionee
.  If an Optionee dies while a Service Provider, the Option may be exercised following the Optionee's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Option is vested on the date of death (but in no event later than the expiration of the term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Optionee's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Optionee's death in a
form and manner acceptable to the Administrator, pursuant to Section 5(b)(viii). If no beneficiary has been designated by the Optionee in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator, then such Option may be exercised by the personal representative of the Optionee's estate or in the event no administration of the Optionee's estate is required, then by the successor-in-interest to whom the Option is transferred pursuant to the Optionee's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution, as the case may be. In the absence of a specified time in the Award Agreement, the Option shall remain exercisable for twelve (12) months following the Optionee's death. If, at the time of death, the Optionee is not vested as to his or her entire Option, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Option shall immediately revert to the Plan. If the Option is not so exercised within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Option shall revert to the Plan.

Rights to Purchase

After the Administrator determines that it will offer Stock Purchase Rights under the Plan, it shall advise the offeree in writing or electronically, by means of a Notice of Grant, of the terms, conditions and restrictions related to the offer, including the number of Shares that the offeree shall be entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, and the time within which the offeree must accept such offer. The offer shall be accepted by execution of a Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement in the form determined by the Administrator.
 
(b)
                                
Number of Shares
.  The Administrator shall have complete discretion to determine the number of Stock Purchase Rights granted to any Participant, provided that during any Fiscal Year, no Participant shall be granted Stock Purchase Rights covering more than 5,000,000 Shares, unless in connection with his or her initial service as described in Section 7(c)(ii).
 
(c)
                                 
Repurchase Option
.  Unless the Administrator determines otherwise, the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall grant the Company a repurchase option exercisable upon the voluntary or involuntary termination of the purchaser's service with the Company for any reason (including death or Disability). The purchase price for Shares repurchased pursuant to the Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement shall be the original price paid by the purchaser and may be paid by cancellation of any indebtedness of the purchaser to the Company. The repurchase option shall lapse at a rate determined by the Administrator.
 
(d)
                                
Other Provisions

(e)
                                 
Rights as a Shareholder
.  Once the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, the purchaser shall have the rights equivalent to those of a shareholder, and shall be a shareholder when his or her purchase is entered upon the records of the duly authorized transfer agent of the Company. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or other right for which the record date is prior to the date the Stock Purchase Right is exercised, except as provided in Section 16 of the Plan.
 
(f)
                                   
Death of Participant
.
 
(i)
                                    
Exercise of Stock Purchase Right
.  If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, the Stock Purchase Right may be exercised following the Participant's death within such period of time as is specified in the Award Agreement to the extent the Stock Purchase Right is vested on the date of death (but in no event later than the expiration date set forth in the Award Agreement), by the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator, pursuant to Section 5(b)(viii). If no beneficiary has been designated by the Participant in a form
and manner acceptable to the Administrator, then such Stock Purchase Right may be exercised by the personal representative of the Participant's estate or in the event no administration of the Participant's estate is required, then by the successor-in-interest to whom the Stock Purchase Right is transferred pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution, as the case may be. If, at the time of death, the Participant is not vested as to his or her entire Stock Purchase Right, the Shares covered by the unvested portion of the Stock Purchase Right shall immediately revert to the Plan. If the Stock Purchase Right is not so exercised within the time as specified in the Award Agreement, the Stock Purchase Right shall terminate, and the Shares covered by such Stock Purchase Right shall revert to the Plan.
 
(ii)
                                 
Release from Escrow
.  If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, any Shares subject to a Stock Purchase Right (A) that have been released from the Company's repurchase option or for which the Company's repurchase option expires or has expired unexercised, and (B) that are not yet released from escrow, shall be issued, and certificates evidencing such released Shares shall be delivered, to the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to Participant's death in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator, pursuant to Section 5(b)(viii). If no beneficiary has been designated by the Participant in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator, then such Shares shall be transferred to the personal representative of the Participant's estate or in the event no administration of the Participant's estate is required, then to the successor-in-interest pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution, as the case may be.

Exercise Price and Other Terms
.  The Administrator, subject to the provisions of the Plan, shall have complete discretion to determine the terms and conditions of SARs granted under the Plan. However, except as may be required by law to ensure favorable tax treatment in a non-U.S. jurisdiction, the exercise price of a freestanding SAR shall be not less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date. The exercise price of tandem or affiliated SARs shall equal the Exercise Price of the related Option.
 
(b)
                                
Exercise of Tandem SARs
.  Tandem SARs may be exercised for all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option. A tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which its related Option is then exercisable. With respect to a tandem SAR granted in connection with an Incentive Stock Option: (a) the tandem SAR shall expire no later than the expiration of the underlying Incentive Stock Option; (b) the value of the payout with respect to the tandem SAR shall be for no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the difference between the Exercise Price of the underlying Incentive Stock Option and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying Incentive Stock Option at the time the tandem SAR is exercised; and (c) the tandem SAR shall be exercisable only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the Incentive Stock Option exceeds the Exercise Price of the Incentive Stock Option.
(c)
                                 
Exercise of Affiliated SARs
.  An affiliated SAR shall be deemed to be exercised upon the exercise of the related Option. The deemed exercise of an affiliated SAR shall not necessitate a reduction in the number of Shares subject to the related Option.
 
(d)
                                
Exercise of Freestanding SARs
.  Freestanding SARs shall be exercisable on such terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
 
(e)
                                 
SAR Agreement
.  Each SAR grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the exercise price, the term of the SAR, the conditions of exercise, and such other terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine.
 
(f)
                                   
Expiration of SARs
.  A SAR granted under the Plan shall expire upon the date determined by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, and set forth in the Award Agreement; however, a SAR granted on or after April 9, 2008 shall expire no later than ten (10) years from the Grant Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rules of Section 11 also shall apply to SARs.
 
(g)
                                
Payment of SAR Amount
.  Upon exercise of a SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
 
(i)
                                    
The difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price; times
 
(ii)
                                 
The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.
 
At the discretion of the Administrator, the payment upon a SAR exercise may be in cash, in Shares of equivalent value, or in some combination thereof. For purposes of Section 4 of the Plan, the reduction in Shares available for future issuance upon the grant of the SAR will be determined at the Grant Date based on the full number of Shares subject to the SAR. Upon settlement of the SAR, there will be no further reduction in Shares available for future issuance under Section 4 of the Plan. Upon the forfeiture of all or a portion of the SAR, the forfeited Shares shall be returned to the Shares available for future issuance under Section 4 of the Plan. For avoidance of doubt, upon settlement of a SAR, Shares will not be returned to the Shares available for future issuance under Section 4 of the Plan, notwithstanding the fact that if Shares are issued in settlement of a SAR they will be issued only based on the difference between the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the exercise price.

Performance Goals and Other Terms
.  The Administrator will set Performance Goals or other vesting provisions (including, without limitation, continued status as a Service Provider) in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number or value of Restricted Stock Units that will be paid out to the Service Providers. The time period during which the Performance Goals or other vesting provisions (including the effects of an actual change of control) must be met will be called the "Performance Period." Each award of Restricted Stock Units will be evidenced by an Award Agreement that will specify the Performance Period, and such other
terms and conditions as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, will determine. The Administrator may set Performance Goals based upon the achievement of Company-wide, divisional, or individual goals, applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by the Administrator in its discretion.
 
(e)

(f)
                                   
Earning of Restricted Stock Units
.  After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the holder of Restricted Stock Units will be entitled to receive a payout of the number of Restricted Stock Units earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding Performance Goals or other vesting provisions have been achieved. After the grant of a Restricted Stock Unit, the Administrator shall not reduce or waive any Performance Goals or other vesting provisions for such Restricted Stock Unit; provided, however, that the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any Performance Goals or other vesting provisions for such Restricted Stock Unit in the event of a Participant's death, Disability, or Retirement, or in the event of an actual change of control, the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or a merger of the Company with or into another entity pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company before such transaction do not retain, directly or indirectly, at least a majority of the beneficial interest in the voting stock of the Company after such transaction.
 
(g)

Death of Participant

If a Participant dies while a Service Provider, any earned Restricted Stock Units that have not yet been paid shall be paid to the Participant's designated beneficiary, provided such beneficiary has been designated prior to the Participant's death in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator, pursuant to Section 5(b)(viii). If no beneficiary has been designated by the Participant in a form and manner acceptable to the Administrator, then such earned Restricted Stock Units shall be paid to the personal representative of the Participant's estate or in the event no administration of the Participant's estate is required, then to the successor-in-interest pursuant to the Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution, as the case may be. If, at the time of death, the Participant holds any Restricted Stock Units that are not yet earned, the unearned Restricted Stock Units shall be forfeited to the Company, and again shall be available for grant under the Plan.

Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the number and class of Shares that may be delivered under the Plan and/or the number, class, and price of Shares covered by each outstanding Award, and the numerical Share limits in Sections 4, 7, 13 and 14 of the Plan, shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification of the Shares, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company; provided, however, that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration." Such adjustment shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares subject to an Award.
 
(b)
                                
Dissolution or Liquidation
.  In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award until ten (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Optioned Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option applicable to any Shares purchased upon exercise of an Award shall lapse as to all such Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been previously exercised, an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16(b) to the contrary, for Awards granted on or after August 14, 2008, that may be considered "deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A, the payment of any Awards that accelerate in accordance with this Section 16(b) nevertheless will be made at the same time or times as if such Awards had vested in accordance with the vesting provisions applicable to such Awards unless otherwise determined by the Administrator.
 
(c)
                                 
Merger or Asset Sale
.  For Awards granted prior to August 14, 2008, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. For Awards granted on or after August 14, 2008, in the event of (i) a merger of the Company with or into another corporation, other than a merger which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or its Parent) at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity or its Parent outstanding immediately after such merger or (ii) the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent option or right substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Award (whether granted prior to, on or after August 14, 2008), the Participant will fully vest in and have the right to exercise all of his or her outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, including Shares as to which such Awards would not otherwise be vested or exercisable, all restrictions on Restricted Stock will lapse,
and, with respect to Restricted Stock Units, all Performance Goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met. In addition, if an Option or Stock Appreciation Right becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of a merger or sale of assets, the Administrator will notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will be fully vested and exercisable for a period of 15 days from the date of such notice, and the Option or Stock Appreciation Right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.
 
For the purposes of this Section 16(c), the Award shall be considered assumed if, following the merger or sale of assets, the Award confers the right (on no less favorable terms and conditions) to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) or, in the case of a Stock Appreciation Right upon the exercise of which the Administrator determines to pay cash or a Restricted Stock Unit which the Administrator can determine to pay in cash, the fair market value of the consideration received in the merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in the merger or sale of assets is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or upon the payout of a Restricted Stock Unit, for each Share subject to such Award (or in the case of Restricted Stock Units, the number of implied shares determined by dividing the value of the Restricted Stock Units by the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets), to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in fair market value to the per Share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in the merger or sale of assets.
 
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 16(c) to the contrary, an Award that vests, is earned or paid-out upon the satisfaction of one or more Performance Goals will not be considered assumed if the Company or its successor modifies any of such Performance Goals without the Participant's consent; provided, however, a modification to such Performance Goals only to reflect the successor corporation's corporate structure post-merger or post-sale of assets will not be deemed to invalidate an otherwise valid Award assumption.
 
17.
                                
Date of Grant
.  The Grant Date of an Award shall be, for all purposes, the date on which the Administrator makes the determination granting such Award, or such other later date as is determined by the Administrator. Notice of the determination shall be provided to each Participant within a reasonable time after the date of such grant.
 
18.

(c)
                                 
Effect of Amendment or Termination
.  No amendment, alteration, suspension or termination of the Plan shall impair the rights of any Participant, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company. Termination of the Plan shall not affect the Administrator's ability to exercise the powers granted to it hereunder with respect to Options granted under the Plan prior to the date of such termination.

20.
                                
Inability to Obtain Authority

Approval of 2011 Long-Term Performance-Based Incentive Plan
 
On May 23, 2011, the Compensation Committee (the "") of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation ("" or the "") approved the Atmel 2011 Long-Term Performance-Based Incentive Plan (the "") to be administered under the Company's 2005 Stock Plan.
Committee
Atmel
Company
2011 Plan
 
General Terms
.  The 2011 Plan provides for the grant of restricted stock units to Company participants.  Restricted stock units will be credited to participants during the term of the 2011 Plan, subject to the satisfaction of applicable performance metrics (as described below).
 
Performance and Vesting.
  The performance periods for the 2011 Plan run from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013, consisting of three one year performance periods (calendar years 2011, 2012 and 2013) and a three year cumulative performance period.  Awards will be credited to participants, up to target levels, in each of calendar years 2011, 2012 and 2013 to the extent that the performance metrics for those periods are satisfied.  A "true-up" calculation will also be made at the end of the three year cumulative period; to the extent the performance metrics for the three year cumulative period are satisfied, participants will be credited with additional awards under the 2011 Plan and may also recapture awards from prior years that had not been earlier credited.  Shares underlying the restricted stock units will not vest, or be released to participants, until a final determination is made by the Compensation Committee regarding the satisfaction of the performance metrics for the three year cumulative period (which is expected in early 2014), except, as determined by the Compensation Committee, in the event of a change of control, death or qualified disability of a participant.  Participants are required to remain employees of, or service providers to, the Company through the date on which the Compensation Committee makes a final determination under the 2011 Plan with respect to the satisfaction of the performance metrics for the three year cumulative performance period.  In general, no shares will vest for any participant until a participant has been an employee of, or a service provider to, the Company for 24 months. For participants who are included within the 2011 Plan after June 1, 2011, awards may be pro rated to reflect the actual time a participant has been an employee of, or a service provider to, the Company.
 
Performance Metrics
.  The 2011 Plan requires that the Company achieve a pro forma operating margin of at least 20% for each applicable performance period, subject to adjustment by the Compensation Committee in the event of an industry wide downturn.  If the Company achieves the requisite pro forma operating margin, awards will be credited to participants based on the relative revenue growth of the Company compared to a semiconductor peer group or the microcontroller revenue growth of a peer group consisting of microcontroller companies, as each peer group is established by the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee will evaluate the Company's relative performance against the designated peer groups, with participants being credited the highest percentage award determined by rankings within those peer groups.
 
For each of the semiconductor and microcontroller peer groups, the 2011 Plan establishes percentile rankings for a minimum hurdle, target objective and maximum goal levels.  If the Company performs at a level above the minimum hurdle for any of the annual performance periods, participants will be credited with a percentage of their award attributable to that annual performance period, scaling to 50% of their award if the Company ranks at or above the target objective level.  If the Company performs at a level above the minimum hurdle for the three year cumulative performance period, participants will be credited with a percentage of their award (to the extent participants have not been credited with 50% of their award in respect of the three annual performance periods), scaling to 50% of their award if the Company ranks at the target objective level.  If the Company performs at a level above the target objective for the three year cumulative performance period, participants will be credited with a percentage of their award, scaling to 100%, if the Company ranks at or above the maximum goal levels for the three year cumulative performance period.
 
Change of Control, Death and Qualified Disability
.  For participants that are subject to change of control protections under their respective employment agreements, the Company's Change of Control and Severance Plan or as otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, shares that have been credited through a change of control will vest and be released based on the Company's actual performance through the most recently completed year prior to the change of control and a pro rata calculation for the year in which the change of control occurs.  Any remaining shares that are not so vested and
released will be converted into time based shares, vesting quarterly until December 31, 2013.
 
In the event that the Compensation Committee affords any participant, in its sole discretion, benefits upon death or qualified disability, as defined in the 2011 Plan, the participant (or the participant's estate) may be entitled to receive shares credited through the date of death or qualified disability and a pro rata portion of shares through the quarter in which the death or qualified disability occurs.  Any remaining shares for that participant will be forfeited.
 
Award Agreement and Participants
.  An agreement will be delivered to each participant under the 2011 Plan, which shall set forth the award of restricted stock units to the participant, including any country-specific appendix with terms for non-U.S. employees.  New participants may be added to the 2011 Plan following the beginning of the performance period, but prior to March 31, 2013.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SAN JOSE, CA, August 3, 2011 
Atmel
 Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
 
Revenues for the second quarter of 2011 were $478.6 million, a 4% increase compared to $461.4 million for the first quarter of 2011, and a 22% increase compared to $393.4 million for the second quarter of 2010.  Adjusting for the Smart Card divestiture completed at the end of the third quarter of 2010, second quarter 2011 revenues increased 31% from the second quarter of the prior year.
 
Net income, on a GAAP basis, totaled $90.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011. This compares to first quarter 2011 net income of $74.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share.  Included in first quarter 2011 results were restructuring charges of $21.2 million or $0.05 per diluted share, related to personnel reductions at Rousset, France following the sale of our wafer fabrication and Smart Card businesses. The second quarter 2011 net income compares to a net loss of $36.4 million or $(0.08) per diluted share for the second quarter of 2010, which included $107.6 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, of charges related to the sale of the company's manufacturing operations in Rousset, France.
 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2011 totaled $124.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $122.2 million or $0.26 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011, and non-GAAP net income of $50.6 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.  Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
 
Gross margin advanced to 51.8% in the second quarter of 2011, a record for the company.  This compares to gross margin of 51.0% in the first quarter of 2011 and 40.6% in the second quarter of 2010.
 
 
"Atmel continues to gain increasing share in the microcontroller market as seen by our most recent quarter's results," said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, record gross margin, and improved profitability are clear indicators of our significantly improved operating model."
 
Second quarter income from operations of $111.0 million or 23.2% of revenues compared with $81.9 million or 17.7% of revenues for the first quarter of 2011, and an operating loss of $(78.9) million or a loss from operations of 20.1% for the second quarter 2010. First quarter 2011 income from operations included $21.2 million of restructuring charges and a $1.9 million gain on the sale of assets while second quarter 2010 loss from operations included charges related to the sale of the company's manufacturing operations in Rousset, France of $107.6 million.
 
Income tax provision totaled $18.8 million for the second quarter of 2011. This compares to an income tax provision of $9.8 million for the first quarter of 2011 and a tax benefit of $39.7 million for the second quarter of 2010.  The income tax benefit for the second quarter 2010 resulted from discrete benefits related to the taxable losses from the Rousset fab transaction and related changes to deferred tax liabilities.
 
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $42.6 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared to $74.1 million for the first quarter of 2011 and $49.2 million for the second quarter of 2010.   Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $453.3 million at the end of the second quarter of 2011.  Net cash balance (cash balances less current and long-term debt) was $448.6 million at June 30, 2011.

Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP shares used in diluted net income (loss) per share calculations:
 
 
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
 
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
 
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense.
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units.  This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.  Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
 
                 
Acquisition-related charges (credits).
 
Acquisition-related charges (credits) include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
 
                 
Restructuring charges.
 
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs.  Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Asset impairment charges.
 
Atmel records an impairment charge, when certain criteria are met, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets.   Management believes that is it is appropriate to exclude these non-cash charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
(Gain) loss on sale of assets.
 
Atmel recognizes (gains) loss resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
 
                 
Pension charge related to fab sale
 
Pension charge related to the release of related accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Rousset, France and the transfer of employees to the fab buyer. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Non-GAAP tax adjustment.
 
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on the Atmel's tax returns, including certain foreign refundable credits.  This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
 
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.
 
Non-GAAP tax amounts for periods prior to January 1, 2011 have not been adjusted to reflect this new methodology.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN JOSE, CA, November 1, 2011 
Atmel
 Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2011.
 
Revenues for the third quarter of 2011 were $479.4 million, up slightly from $478.6 million for the second quarter of 2011, and an 8% increase compared to $444.3 million for the third quarter of 2010.  Adjusting for the Smart Card divestiture completed at the end of the third quarter of 2010, third quarter 2011 revenues increased 15% from the third quarter of the prior year.
 
Net income, on a GAAP basis, totaled $116.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2011. Included in net income for the third quarter was a $33.4 million gain from the sale of the company's corporate headquarters.  This compares to second quarter 2011 net income of $90.9 million, or $0.19 per diluted share.  The third quarter 2011 net income compares to net income of $219.8 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010, which included a significant tax benefit from the settlement of an IRS tax audit of $150.4 million.
 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2011 totaled $124.0 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $124.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011, and non-GAAP net income of $88.4 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.  Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
 
Gross margin was 50.1% in the third quarter of 2011, as compared to 51.8% in the second quarter of 2011 and an increase from 46.8% in the third quarter of 2010.
 
"We are pleased with our
third quarter financial performance, especially in light of the weaker macro environment. Our results confirm the value of our strategic focus on
high growth microcontroller opportunities and our
transition to a fab-lite manufacturing model,
" said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Due to global economic uncertainties, w
e
are adjusting our business activities consistent with the current market conditions.  We
remain confident that our strategy, operational focus, superior product portfolio and market penetration will enable us to continue to outpace our industry throughout this period."
Third quarter income from operations was $140.2 million, or 29.2% of revenues, compared with $111.0 million, or 23.2% of revenues, for the second quarter of 2011 and $77.7 million, or 17.5% of revenues, for the third quarter of 2010. Third quarter 2011 income from operations included a $33.4 million gain from the sale of our corporate headquarters, while third quarter 2010 income from operations included a $5.7 million loss from the sale of the former Smart Card business and restructuring charges of $1 million.
 
Income tax provision totaled $23.2 million for the third quarter of 2011. This compares to an income tax provision of $18.8 million for the second quarter of 2011 and a tax benefit of $136.6 million for the third quarter of 2010.  The income tax benefit for the third quarter of 2010 included a $150.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, tax benefit from the settlement of an IRS tax audit resulting in the release of tax reserves of approximately $102 million, plus a $48.4 million tax refund.
 
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $61.1 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $42.6 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $95.3 million for the third quarter of 2010.   Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $482.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2011, after spending $56.3 million during the quarter on stock repurchases.  Net cash balance (cash balances less current and long-term debt) was $478.1 million at September 30, 2011.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
 
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
 
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense.
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units.  This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.  Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
 
                 
Acquisition-related charges.
 
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
 
                 
Restructuring charges.
 
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs.  Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Asset impairment charges.
 
Atmel records an impairment charge, when certain criteria are met, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets.   Management believes that is it is appropriate to exclude these non-cash charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
(Gain) loss on sale of assets.
 
Atmel recognizes (gains) loss resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
 
                 
Pension charge related to fab sale
 
Pension charge related to the release of related accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Rousset, France and the transfer of employees to the fab buyer. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Non-GAAP tax adjustment.
 
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on the Atmel's tax returns, including certain foreign refundable credits.  This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
 
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.
 
Non-GAAP tax amounts for periods prior to January 1, 2011 have not been adjusted to reflect this new methodology.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SAN JOSE, CA, February 2, 2012 
Atmel
 Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced that it expects 2011 fourth quarter revenues to be approximately $384 million, down 20% sequentially from the third quarter of 2011.  The company's previous guidance indicated that revenue would decline sequentially in the range of 12% to 16% (or $403 million to $422 million). Q4 revenue was negatively affected by approximately $11 million as a result of rescheduling payments on a receivable related to an Asian distributor.
 
"As we progressed through our year end closing process, we expected fourth quarter revenues of about $395 million, slightly below the previously announced range," said Stephen Cumming, Atmel's Chief Financial Officer. "At the lower revenue number of $384 million, which reflects the rescheduled payments, gross margin is expected to remain within previously announced guidance (48% +/- 0.5%)."
 
As previously scheduled, the company will announce its fourth quarter and 2011 full year financial results on February 8, 2012, at which time the company will also provide updated guidance for the first quarter of 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
SAN JOSE, CA, February 8, 2012 
Atmel
 Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2011.
 
 
(In millions, except earnings per diluted share and percentages)
 
Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 was $383.6 million, a 20% decrease compared to  $479.4 million for the third quarter of 2011, and 16% lower compared to $457.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  GAAP net income totaled $32.9 million or $0.07 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares to $116.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2011.  Included in net income for the third quarter was a $33.4 million gain from the sale of the company's corporate headquarters.  The fourth quarter 2011 net income of $32.9 million or $0.07 per diluted share compares to net income of $223.1 million or $0.47 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2010, which included $118.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, primarily from releasing reserves for deferred tax assets. For the full year of 2011, net
 
income was $315.0 million or $0.68 per diluted share, compared to net income of $423.1 million or $0.90 per diluted share for 2010.
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 totaled $67.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $124.0 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2011, and non-GAAP net income of $119.2 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.  For the full year 2011, non-GAAP net income increased 55% to $438.0 million or $0.92 per diluted share, compared to $283.3 million or $0.59 per diluted share for 2010.  Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
 
GAAP gross margin was 48.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011, as compared to 50.1% in the third quarter of 2011 and 49.5% in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, GAAP gross margin increased to 50.4%, compared to 44.3% for 2010.  Non-GAAP gross margin was 48.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011, which compares to 50.4% in the immediately preceding quarter and 50.0% in the fourth quarter of 2010.  For the full year 2011, non-GAAP gross margin improved to 50.8% compared to 44.8% for 2010.
 
For the full year 2011, revenue increased 10% to $1.80 billion, compared to $1.64 billion for 2010. Adjusting for the divestiture of the company's Smart Card business that occurred at the end of the third quarter of 2010, full year 2011 revenue increased 15% from 2010.
 
"
Despite the macroeconomic headwinds that affected the entire industry in the fourth quarter, I'm pleased with the overall results and progress we made across all of our business segments during 2011,
" said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We remain confident that our long-term strategy, exceptional product portfolio, and
the recent launch of our new maXTouch "S" series
, will enable us to resume accelerated growth rates."
 
Fourth quarter 2011 income from operations on a GAAP basis was $49.0 million or 12.8% of revenue, compared with $140.2 million or 29.2% of revenue for the third quarter of 2011 and $93.8 million or 20.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010. Fourth quarter 2011 income from operations included a $1.1 million restructuring credit and $2.3 million in acquisition related charges, while third quarter 2011 income from operations included a $33.4 million gain from the sale of our corporate headquarters and $1.0 million acquisition related charges, and fourth quarter 2010 income from operations included $1.6 million restructuring charges and $1.2 million of acquisition related charges. The 2011 GAAP full year income from operations was $382.0 million compared to $107.5 million for 2010.
 
Non-GAAP income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 was $68.7 million or 17.9% of revenue, compared to third quarter non-GAAP income from operations of $124.2 million or 25.9% of revenue, and fourth quarter 2010 non-GAAP income from operations of $112.2 million or 24.5% of revenue.  For the full year of 2011, non-GAAP income from operations was $440.3 million compared to $287.5 million for 2010.
 
Income tax provision, on a GAAP basis, totaled $14.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2011. This compares to an income tax provision of $23.2 million for the third quarter of 2011 and a tax benefit of $133.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.  During 2010, the company favorably settled tax audits and released reserves for deferred tax assets which contributed $247.9 million of the total tax benefit recorded for the year.  Non-GAAP income tax benefit
 
during the fourth quarter of 2011 was $0.5 million compared to $0 for the third quarter 2011. For the full year 2011, non-GAAP tax provision was $1.5 million.
 
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $43.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $61.1 million for the third quarter of 2011 and $84.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2010.

These statements may include comments about our future operating and financial performance, including our outlook for 2012, our expectations regarding market share and product revenue growth, and Atmel's strategies.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
 
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in above.
 
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense.
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units.  This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.  Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
 
                 
Acquisition-related charges.
 
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
 
                 
Restructuring charges.
 
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs.  Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Asset impairment charges.
 
Atmel records an impairment charge, when certain criteria are met, for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the assets.   Management believes that is it is appropriate to exclude these non-cash charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
(Gain) loss on sale of assets.
 
Atmel recognizes (gains) loss resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
 
                 
Pension charge related to fab sale
 
Pension charge related to the release of related accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of Atmel's sale of its manufacturing operations in Rousset, France and the transfer of employees to the fab buyer. Management believes that it is appropriate to exclude this adjustment from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Non-GAAP tax adjustment.
 
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on the Atmel's tax returns, including certain foreign refundable credits.  This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
 
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.
 
Non-GAAP tax amounts for periods prior to January 1, 2011 have not been adjusted to reflect this new methodology.

(a)          
Dismissal of Previous Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
On March 16, 2012, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee") of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") notified PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") that it was terminating PwC's engagement as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, effective immediately.
 
PwC's reports on the Company's financial statements for the two years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
 
During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and the subsequent interim period through March 16, 2012, there were no disagreements, within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions thereto, with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports. Also during this same period, there were no reportable events within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions thereto.
 
The Company has provided PwC with the above disclosures, and has requested PwC to furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements made by the Company and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree.

Fiscal 2012 Executive Bonus Plan
 
On March 27, 2012, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the "Company") adopted an executive bonus plan for 2012. The executive bonus plan is an incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the Company's financial and other performance objectives and to reward them if, and when, those objectives are met. All of the Company's executive officers, including all of its officers designated as "Section 16" officers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other designated employees of the Company, are eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan (individually, a "Participant," and collectively, the "Participants"). Target bonuses for Participants range from 35% to 160% of a Participant's annual base salary.  The bonus actually paid to a Participant will be based on the achievement of (i) Company performance objectives related to the Company's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit as compared to the Company's annual operating plan, (ii) individual performance objectives approved by the Compensation Committee, and (iii) for some Participants, business unit objectives tied to the business unit's annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit, or objectives tied to corporate sales revenue. Achievement of each factor will be measured independently, and a minimum threshold for each factor must be met for any credit to be given to that factor. The Compensation Committee set a minimum threshold, target objective and stretch objective for annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit. Bonuses will be prorated between threshold and target performance and target and stretch performance. The actual bonuses payable for 2012, if any, could range from zero to 200% of a Participant's bonus target and will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce or increase the bonus that would otherwise be payable based on actual performance. No bonuses, however, will be paid under the executive bonus plan if the Company does not achieve an annual non-GAAP operating profit (excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition and divestiture related expenses, certain legal, accounting and related expenses, and other items approved by the Compensation Committee). With respect to Participants eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan as of March 27, 2012 (which may change over the course of the year), the aggregate amount of bonuses payable under the executive bonus plan to such Participants would be approximately $7 million at target performance, and the aggregate amount of bonuses payable to such Participants would be approximately $14 million at stretch performance.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
SAN JOSE, CA, May 2, 2012 
Atmel
 Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2012.
 
 
(In millions, except earnings per diluted share and percentages)
 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2012 was $357.8 million, a 7% decrease compared to $383.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2011, and 22% lower compared to $461.4 million for the first quarter of 2011.  GAAP net income totaled $20.4 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2012. This compares to $32.9 million or $0.07 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2011 and $74.6 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2011, which included restructuring charges of $21.2 million or $0.05 per diluted share.
 
Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2012 totaled $35.3 million or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $67.5 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011, and non-GAAP net income of $122.2 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.  Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
 
GAAP gross margin was 42.6% in the first quarter of 2012, as compared to 48.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011 and 51.0% in the first quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP gross margin was 43.2% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 48.7% in the immediately preceding quarter and 51.5% in the first quarter of 2011.
 
"As we predicted, our business bottomed during the first quarter, and we are
well positioned to capitalize on the improving industry environment,
" said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and
 
 
 
Chief Executive Officer. "The introduction of our new AVR, ARM Cortex, maXTouch S and XSense products set a strong foundation for sequential growth throughout 2012 and beyond."
First quarter 2012 income from operations on a GAAP basis was $25.0 million or 7.0% of revenue, compared with $49.0 million or 12.8% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2011 and $81.9 million or 17.7% of revenue for the first quarter of 2011. First quarter 2012 income from operations included a $10.7 million benefit from the release of reserves related to a previously established foreign government grant and $2.0 million in acquisition related charges.
 
Non-GAAP income from operations in the first quarter of 2012 was $35.6 million or 9.9% of revenue, compared to fourth quarter non-GAAP income from operations of $68.7 million or 17.9% of revenue, and first quarter 2011 non-GAAP income from operations of $121.1 million or 26.2% of revenue.
 
Income tax provision, on a GAAP basis, totaled $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2012. This compares to an income tax provision of $14.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and a tax provision of $9.8 million for the first quarter of 2011.  Non-GAAP income tax provision during the first quarter of 2012 was $0.1 million compared to an income tax benefit of $0.5 million for the fourth quarter 2011 and a non-GAAP tax provision of $1.4 million during the first quarter of 2011.
 
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $60.6 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $43.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2011 and $74.1 million for the first quarter of 2011.   Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $299.1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2012, after spending $96.2 million during the quarter on stock repurchases.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
 
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided above.
 
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
      Stock-based compensation expense.
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units.  This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.  Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
      Acquisition-related charges.
 
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
 
      Restructuring (credits) charges.
 
Restructuring (credits) charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs.  Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring (credits) charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
      Credit from reserved grant income.
 
Atmel recognized a credit from reserved grant income as a result of a ministerial decision of the Greek government which was executed providing for a partial refund of outstanding state grants previously made. Based on the execution of this ministerial decision and the subsequent publication of that decision, management determined that it would not be required to repay the full amount of the outstanding grant. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude credit from reserved grant income from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
      Gain on sale of assets.
 
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort the period-over-period comparison.
 
      Non-GAAP tax adjustment.
 
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on Atmel's tax returns, including certain foreign refundable credits.  This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
 
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.
 
Non-GAAP tax amounts for periods prior to January 1, 2011 have not been adjusted to reflect this new methodology.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
San Jose, CA, May 2, 2012 - Atmel Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized an additional $200 million allocation of funds to its existing $500 million common stock repurchase program.
 
Of the company's previously authorized $500 million program, to date the company has repurchased approximately $489.4 million, or 49.9 million shares, of its common stock at an average price of $9.80.
 
"The addition of another $200 million to our current program reflects our confidence in the continued growth of our company and the fundamental strength of our business model," said Stephen Cumming, Atmel's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
 
The program authorizes the purchase of Atmel common stock in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase programs or through other methods, including yield enhancement strategies, structured financial instruments and other derivative methods linked to the company's equity prices, at such times as management may determine to be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders, depending upon market conditions and other factors.  The program does not have an expiration date.  The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases will be based on the level of cash balances, general business and market conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities.

SAN JOSE, CA, July 31, 2012 
Atmel
 Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2012.
 
 
(In millions, except earnings per diluted share and percentages)
 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2012 was $368.2 million, a 3% increase compared to $357.8 million for the first quarter of 2012, and 23% lower compared to $478.6 million for the second quarter of 2011.  GAAP net income, which includes $14.4 million of pre-tax charges primarily related to restructuring activities in Europe, totaled $0.8 million or $0.00 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2012. This compares to GAAP net income of $20.4 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2012, and $90.9 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011.
 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2012 totaled $37.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $35.3 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012, and non-GAAP net income of $124.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the year-ago quarter.  Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
 
GAAP gross margin was 44.0% in the second quarter of 2012, as compared to 42.6% in the first quarter of 2012 and 51.8% in the second quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP gross margin was 44.6% in the second quarter of 2012 compared to 43.2% in the immediately preceding quarter and 52.3% in the second quarter of 2011.
 
"The second quarter marked strong revenue growth for our core microcontroller business and company gross margin expanded at a healthy rate," said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our product pipeline remains excellent and
positive secular trends, including the launch of Windows 8, will help drive our business over the longer-term."
 
 
 
Second quarter 2012 income from operations on a GAAP basis was $8.2 million or 2.2% of revenue, compared to $25.0 million or 7.0% of revenue for the first quarter of 2012 and $111.0 million or 23.2% of revenue for the second quarter of 2011. Second quarter 2012 income from operations included $14.4 million of restructuring charges and $2.0 million in acquisition related charges, while first quarter 2012 income from operations included a $10.7 million benefit from the release of reserves related to a previously established foreign government grant and $2.0 million in acquisition-related charges.
 
Non-GAAP income from operations in the second quarter of 2012 was $43.0 million or 11.7% of revenue, compared to first quarter non-GAAP income from operations of $35.6 million or 9.9% of revenue, and second quarter 2011 non-GAAP income from operations of $126.3 million or 26.4% of revenue.
 
Income tax provision, on a GAAP basis, totaled $3.7 million for the second quarter of 2012. This compares to an income tax provision of $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2012 and a tax provision of $18.8 million for the second quarter of 2011.  Non-GAAP income tax provision for the second quarter of 2012 was $1.8 million compared to $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2012 and a non-GAAP tax provision of $0.7 million for the second quarter of 2011.
 
Cash provided from operations totaled approximately $7.9 million for the second quarter of 2012, compared to $60.6 million for the first quarter of 2012 and $42.6 million for the second quarter of 2011.   Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled $245.7 million at the end of the second quarter of 2012, after spending $44.4 million during the quarter on stock repurchases.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
 
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting,
 
 
forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
 
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results "through the eyes" of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided above.
 
As presented in the "Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures" tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
                 
Stock-based compensation expense.
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units.  This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.  Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
 
                 
Acquisition-related charges.
 
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
 
 
                 
Restructuring charges.
 
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs.  Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Credit from reserved grant income.
 
Atmel recognized a credit from reserved grant income as a result of a ministerial decision executed by the Greek government providing for a partial refund of an outstanding state grant previously made. Based on the execution of this ministerial decision and the subsequent publication of that decision, management determined that it would not be required to repay the full amount of the outstanding grant. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude credit from reserved grant income from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
 
                 
Gain on sale of assets.
 
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort period-over-period comparisons.
 
                 
Non-GAAP tax adjustment.
 
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on Atmel's tax returns.  This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
 
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.

###
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results through the eyes of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided above.
As presented in the Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2)
contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognized a credit from reserved grant income as a result of a ministerial decision executed by the Greek government providing for a partial refund of an outstanding state grant previously made. Based on the execution of this ministerial decision and the subsequent publication of that decision, management determined that it would not be required to repay the full amount of the outstanding grant. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude credit from reserved grant income from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort period-over-period comparisons.
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on Atmel's tax returns. This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.

Walt Lifsey
Atmel Corporation

Lifsey retired as Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and from all other positions as a director or officer of any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, effective October 31, 2012.

###
Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results through the eyes of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided above.
As presented in the Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Loss from foundry arrangement relates to the Company's assessment of the probable loss with respect to a European foundry take or pay arrangement for wafers to be delivered during the remaining term of the arrangement.   Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude loss from foundry arrangement from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Impairment of receivables from foundry supplier relates to the Company's assessment of the probability of collecting on receivables from a European foundry supplier for certain services provided by Atmel to that foundry.  Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude impairment of receivables from foundry supplier from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.  
 
Stock-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. This includes stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes stock-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for stock-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by stock-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges (credit) are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognized a credit from reserved grant income as a result of a ministerial decision executed by the Greek government providing for a partial refund of an outstanding state grant previously made. Based on the execution of this ministerial decision and the subsequent publication of that decision, management determined that it would not be required to repay the full amount of the outstanding grant. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude credit from reserved grant income from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort period-over-period comparisons.
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on Atmel's tax returns. This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on
its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.

Exhibit 99.1
Atmel Reports
First
Quarter
2013
Financial Results
SAN JOSE, CA,
May 1, 2013
--
Atmel
Corporation (Nasdaq: ATML), a leader in microcontroller and touch solutions, today announced financial results for its
first
quarter ended
March 31, 2013
.
(In millions, except earnings per share data and percentages)
Revenue for the
first
quarter of
2013
was
$329.1 million
, a 5% decrease compared to
$345.1 million
for the
fourth
quarter of
2012
, and 8% lower compared to
$357.8 million
for the
first
quarter of
2012
. Adjusting for the Serial Flash divestiture that occurred in September 2012,
first
quarter
2013
revenue decreased 4% sequentially and declined 5% from the
first
quarter of the prior year.
GAAP net loss totaled
$(47.7) million
or
$(0.11)
per diluted share for the
first
quarter of
2013
, principally as a result of a
$42.8 million
charge incurred primarily for restructuring activities and
$21.6 million
of legal-related settlement charges. These charges were offset by a gain on the sale of our Serial Flash product line of
$4.4 million
. This compares to GAAP net loss of
$(12.3) million
or
$(0.03)
per diluted share for the
fourth
quarter of
2012
, and GAAP net income of
$20.4 million
or
$0.05
per diluted share for the
first
quarter of
2012
.
Non-GAAP net income for the
first
quarter of
2013
totaled
$13.6 million
or
$0.03
per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of
$29.4 million
or $
0.07
per diluted share in the
fourth
quarter of
2012
, and non-GAAP net income of
$35.3 million
or $
0.08
per diluted share for the year-ago quarter. Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
GAAP gross margin was
39.9%
in the
first
quarter of
2013
, compared to
38.1%
in the
fourth
quarter of
2012
and
42.6%
in the
first
quarter of
2012
. Non-GAAP gross margin was
40.5%
in the
first
quarter of
2013
as compared to
41.6%
in the immediately preceding quarter and
43.2%
in the
first
quarter of
2012
.
  
Improving business conditions, a healthier backlog, and our strong product portfolio provide us increased confidence moving forward this year,
said Steve Laub, Atmel's President and Chief
            
Executive Officer. "We are making good progress enhancing our cost structure which we expect to materially benefit our long-term margin profile."
First
quarter
2013
loss from operations on a GAAP basis was
$(62.4) million
or
19.0%
of revenue, compared to loss from operations of
$(13.2) million
or
3.8%
of revenue for the
fourth
quarter of
2012
and income from operations of
$25.0 million
or
7.0%
of revenue for the
first
quarter of
2012
.
First
quarter
2013
loss from operations was adversely affected by
$42.8 million
of charges incurred primarily for restructuring activities, legal-related settlement charges of
$21.6 million
and
$2.3 million
in acquisition-related charges. These charges were offset by a gain on the sale of our Serial Flash product line of
$4.4 million
. In comparison,
fourth
quarter
2012
loss from operations was adversely affected by a $10.6 million loss incurred on purchase commitments relating to a take-or-pay supply agreement, $11.0 million of charges incurred primarily for restructuring activities, a $6.5 million write-off of receivables from a foundry supplier, and $1.9 million in acquisition-related charges, and
first
quarter
2012
income from operations included a $10.7 million benefit from the release of reserves related to a previously received R&D grant and
$2.0 million
in acquisition-related charges.
Non-GAAP income from operations in the
first
quarter of
2013
was
$14.2 million
or
4.3%
of revenue, compared to
fourth
quarter non-GAAP income from operations of
$33.3 million
or
9.7%
of revenue, and
first
quarter
2012
non-GAAP income from operations of
$35.6 million
or
9.9%
of revenue. Refer to the non-GAAP reconciliation table included in this release for more details.
Income tax benefit, on a GAAP basis, totaled
$14.4 million
for the
first
quarter of
2013
. This compares to a benefit from income taxes of
$2.2 million
for the
fourth
quarter of
2012
and a provision for income taxes of
$4.3 million
for the
first
quarter of
2012
. Non-GAAP provision for income taxes for the
first
quarter of
2013
was
$1.0 million
compared to non-GAAP income tax provisions of
$2.6 million
for the
fourth
quarter of
2012
and
$0.1 million
for the
first
quarter of
2012
.
Cash used in operations totaled approximately
$12.0 million
for the
first
quarter of
2013
, compared to cash provided by operations of $78.7 million for the
fourth
quarter
of
2012
and $60.6 million for the
first
quarter of
2012
. Combined cash balances (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) totaled
$244.8 million
at the end of the
first
quarter of
2013
, a decrease of
$51.2 million
from the immediately preceding quarter. The decrease in cash balances during the first quarter of 2013 resulted principally from payments for two acquisitions, a prepayment made to Conductive Inject Technologies to support XSense production, timing of vendor payables and customer receivables and common stock repurchases.

Notes to Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement its consolidated financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, Atmel uses non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share, which are adjusted from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to exclude certain items, as shown above and described below. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional and useful way of viewing aspects of Atmel's operations that, when viewed in conjunction with Atmel's GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the various factors and trends affecting Atmel's business and operations.
Atmel uses each of these non-GAAP financial measures for internal purposes and believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding operational and financial performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures for strategic and business decision making, internal budgeting, forecasting and resource allocation processes. Atmel may, in the future, determine to present non-GAAP financial measures other than those presented in this release, which it believes may be useful to investors. Any such determinations will be made with the intention of providing the most useful information to investors and will reflect information used by the company's management in assessing its business, which may change from time to time.
Atmel believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to the GAAP financial results, is useful to investors because the non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to see Atmel's results through the eyes of management as these non-GAAP financial measures reflect Atmel's internal measurement processes. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to better assess changes in each key element of Atmel's operating results across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Thus, management believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with another method for assessing Atmel's operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may facilitate comparisons to Atmel's historical operating results and to competitors' operating results.
 
There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon Atmel's reported financial results. Management compensates for these limitations by providing investors with reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures supplement, and should be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors should review the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided above.
As presented in the Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measures tables above, each of the non-GAAP financial measures excludes one or more of the following items:
Loss related to foundry arrangement relates to the Company's assessment of the probable loss with respect to a European foundry take or pay arrangement for wafers to be delivered during the remaining term of the arrangement.   Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude loss related to foundry arrangement from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
(Recovery) impairment of receivables from foundry supplier relates to the Company's assessment of the probability of collecting on receivables from a European foundry supplier for certain services provided by Atmel to that foundry.  Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude (recovery) impairment of receivables from foundry supplier from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.  
 
Share-based compensation expense relates primarily to equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units. This includes share-based compensation expense related to performance-based restricted stock units for which Atmel recognizes share-based compensation expense to the extent management believes it probable that Atmel will achieve the performance criteria which occurs before these awards actually vest. If the performance goals are unlikely to be met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. Share-based compensation is a non-cash expense that varies in amount from period to period and is dependent on market forces that are often beyond Atmel's control. As a result, management excludes this item from Atmel's internal operating forecasts and models. Management believes that non-GAAP measures adjusted for share-based compensation provide investors with a basis to measure Atmel's core performance against the performance of other companies without the variability created by share-based compensation as a result of the variety of equity awards used by other companies and the varying methodologies and assumptions used.
Acquisition-related charges include: (1) amortization of intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as customer relationships, backlog, core developed technology, trade names and non-compete agreements and (2) contingent compensation expense, which include compensation resulting from the employment retention of certain key employees established in accordance with the terms of the acquisitions. In most cases, these acquisition-related charges are not factored into management's evaluation of potential acquisitions or Atmel's performance after completion of acquisitions, because they are not related to Atmel's core operating performance. In addition, the frequency and amount of such charges can vary significantly based on the size and timing of acquisitions and the maturities of the businesses being acquired. Excluding acquisition-related charges from non-GAAP measures provides investors with a basis to compare Atmel against the performance of other companies without the variability caused by purchase accounting.
Restructuring charges primarily relate to expenses necessary to make infrastructure-related changes to Atmel's operating costs. Restructuring charges are excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they are not considered core operating activities. Although Atmel has engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, each has been a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude restructuring charges from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognized a credit from reserved grant income as a result of a ministerial decision executed by the Greek government providing for a partial refund of an outstanding state grant previously made. Based on the execution of this ministerial decision and the subsequent publication of that decision, management determined that it would not be required to repay the full amount of the outstanding grant. Atmel believes that it is appropriate to exclude credit from reserved grant income from Atmel's non-GAAP financial measures, as it enhances the ability of investors to compare Atmel's period-over-period operating results from continuing operations.
Atmel recognizes gains resulting from the sale of certain non-strategic assets that no longer align with Atmel's long-term operating plan. Atmel excludes these items from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because these gains are individually discrete events and generally not reflective of the ongoing operating performance of Atmel's business and can distort period-over-period comparisons.
Settlement charges related to legal settlements undertaken in connection with actual, contemplated or anticipated litigation, or activities undertaken in preparation for, or anticipation of, possible litigation related to intellectual property, customer claims or other matters affecting the business that are generally not reflective of ongoing company performance or ordinary course of litigation expenses.
In conjunction with the implementation of Atmel's global structure changes which took effect January 1, 2011, the company changed its methodology for reporting non-GAAP taxes. Beginning in the first quarter of 2011, Atmel's non-GAAP tax amounts approximate operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on Atmel's tax returns. This approach is designed to enhance the ability of investors to understand the company's tax expense on its current operations, provide improved modeling accuracy, and substantially reduce fluctuations caused by GAAP adjustments which may not reflect actual cash tax expense.
Atmel forecasts its annual cash tax liability and allocates the tax to each quarter in proportion to earnings for that period.

Fiscal 2013 Executive Bonus Plan
 
On May 10, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Atmel Corporation (the Company) adopted an executive bonus plan for 2013. The executive bonus plan is an incentive program designed to motivate participants to achieve the Companys financial and other performance objectives and to reward them if, and when, those objectives are met. All of the Companys executive officers, including all of its officers designated as Section 16 officers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and other designated employees of the Company, are eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan (individually, a Participant, and collectively, the Participants). Target bonuses for Participants range from 25% to 160% of a Participants annual base salary.  The bonus actually paid to a Participant will be based on the achievement of (i) Company performance objectives during two semi-annual performance periods (
i.e.,
January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013 and July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013) related to semi-annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit, (ii) individual performance objectives approved by the Compensation Committee, and (iii) for some Participants, business unit objectives tied to the business units semi-annual revenue and non-GAAP operating profit, or objectives tied to corporate sales revenue. Achievement of each factor will be measured independently, and a minimum threshold for each factor must be met for any credit to be given to that factor. The Compensation Committee sets minimum thresholds, target objectives and stretch objectives for each semi-annual period, based on the quarterly and annual goals under the Companys annual operating plan, then-current business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Compensation Committee, including advice received from its independent compensation consultant. Bonuses will be prorated between threshold and target performance and target and stretch performance. The actual bonuses payable for 2013, if any, could range from zero to 200% of a Participants target bonus and will vary depending on the extent to which actual performance meets, exceeds or falls short of the goals approved by the Compensation Committee. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to reduce or increase the bonus that would otherwise be payable based on actual performance. No bonuses, however, will be paid under the executive bonus plan if the Company does not achieve an annual non-GAAP operating profit (excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and impairment charges, acquisition and divestiture related expenses, certain legal, accounting and related payments, fees and expenses, intellectual property related settlement and license payments, and other items approved by the Compensation Committee). Notwithstanding the semi-annual measurement of Company performance under the executive bonus plan, all bonuses earned (other than quarterly corporate sales revenue-related bonuses earned by Participants who are sales executives, which will be paid quarterly) will be paid after the close of the fiscal year, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee. Based on competitive pay practices, market circumstances and other factors deemed relevant to the Compensation Committee, including the advice of its independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to approve partial or accelerated payment of bonuses earned for the first semi-annual performance period prior to the end of the 2013 fiscal year. With respect to Participants eligible to participate in the executive bonus plan as of May 10, 2013 (which may change over the course of the year), as of such date the aggregate amount of bonuses payable under the executive bonus plan to such Participants would be approximately $7.1 million at target performance, and the aggregate amount of bonuses payable to such Participants would be approximately $14.1 million at stretch performance.
Compensatory Arrangement for Interim Chief Financial Officer
On May 15, 2013, the Company entered into a new compensatory arrangement with Steve Skaggs, currently serving as the Companys Interim Chief Financial Officer. Under the terms of that arrangement, Mr. Skaggs will receive an annual base salary of $442,000 during the period that he serves as interim Chief Financial Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer. Mr. Skaggss target incentive bonus during that same period will be 90% of his annual base salary. In addition, during that period Mr. Skaggs will receive a monthly allowance, in a reasonable amount determined by the Chief Executive Officer, to compensate him for travel and associated commuting expenses to and from the Companys corporate headquarters in San Jose, California. If Mr. Skaggss service as interim Chief Financial Officer ends for any reason, in which event he will resume his position as Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy & Development, his base salary and target bonus percentage will revert to the same base salary and bonus target percentage as applied to him prior to his appointment as interim Chief Financial Officer.
