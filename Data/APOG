NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, April 2, 2003
 
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (April 2, 2003)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, automotive and large-scale optical industries, today announced that fiscal 2003 earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2 percent and net earnings were up 16 percent per share compared to fiscal 2002.
 
For the 12-month period ended March 1, 2003, Apogee's earnings from continuing operations were $0.93 per share or $26.4 million, compared with $0.91 per share or $26.1 million a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share. Fiscal 2003 net earnings were $1.06 per share or $29.9 million, including fourth-quarter income of $0.13 per share or $3.6 million from discontinued operations. There were no discontinued operations earnings in fiscal 2002. Revenues for fiscal 2003 were $771.8 million, down 4 percent from $802.3 million last year.
 
During fiscal 2003, Apogee used its strong cash flow to continue to reduce long-term debt and to repurchase 1.5 million shares. Long-term debt declined 32 percent to $47.3 million, compared to $69.1 million at the end of fiscal 2002, and the company funded $18.0 million of share repurchases.
 
"I am pleased with what we were able to achieve despite the slowed economy and pricing pressures that impacted all of our segments," said Russell Huffer, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We were able to somewhat offset these challenges because our architectural segment continued to outperform the commercial construction market, and we achieved significant improvements in large-scale optical segment performance. We also benefited from continued improvements in operations and our cost cutting initiatives, including our Six Sigma program, which contributed ongoing expense savings of $12.7 million in fiscal 2003."

Fourth quarter results
Apogee's fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.18 per share, or $5.0 million, versus $0.15 per share, or $4.4 million, in the prior-year period. Fourth quarter earnings from continuing operations exceeded expectations due to earlier than anticipated one-time items totaling approximately $0.05 cents per share, with $0.03 resulting from a lower tax rate due to a significant deduction from a donation of certain intellectual property (lowering the tax rate for the quarter to 12 percent) and $0.02 from asset sales. Fourth quarter revenues of $187.7 million were flat compared to the same period last year.
 
Net earnings in the fiscal 2003 fourth quarter were $0.31 per share or $8.6 million, including income of $0.13 per share or $3.6 million from discontinued operations, versus net earnings of $0.15 per share, or $4.4 million, in the prior-year period, which had no discontinued operations income. This non-cash gain resulted from favorable resolution of certain exposures as well as from reductions in estimated future liabilities for the discontinued European curtainwall operations.
 
"Although the architectural segment slowed as anticipated, revenues were slightly better than expected due to project timing. Earnings also were stronger than expected due in part to cost reductions implemented in the quarter," said Huffer. "Our other two segments performed as expected, with the large-scale optical segment again turning in a strong performance, and continuing pricing pressures in the auto glass segment leading to an operating loss."
 
Architectural products and services
Fourth quarter revenues for Apogee's largest segment, architectural products and services, declined 4 percent to $113.2 million, compared to $118.5 million in the prior-year quarter due to the slowed economy and delays in construction project timing. Operating income, however, declined 31 percent to $6.5 million from $9.3 million a year ago as project delays led to lower production levels at most businesses, along with a higher percent of lower-margin institutional projects. The operating margin declined to 5.7 percent from 7.9 percent in the prior-year period, reflecting the changing market.
 
The architectural segment backlog decreased slightly to $147.3 million, compared to $151.3 million at the end of the third quarter; the backlog was $192.7 million at the end of fiscal 2002. This is consistent with the continuing economic uncertainty and related slowdown in commercial construction, which are causing delays in project commitments and scheduling for the segment. Improved lead times in the company's architectural businesses also contributed to the backlog drop from a year ago.
 
Automotive replacement glass and services
Automotive segment revenues for the fourth quarter were $52.9 million, down slightly from $53.5 million in the prior-year period. The segment reported an operating loss of $0.5 million, compared to operating income of $3.1 million in the same period last year due to challenging industry conditions for manufacturing and retail that include overcapacity and pricing pressures. Although Apogee's retail unit volume increased 17 percent from the prior-year period, pricing and customer mix led to a 12 percent decrease in average unit selling price, which significantly impacted margins.
 
Large-scale optical technologies
In the fourth quarter, revenues increased 33 percent to $21.7 million, from $16.3 million in the prior-year period, due to continued improvements in key consumer electronics and retail framing markets. The segment reported operating income of $2.4 million, versus an operating loss of $1.4 million in the

same period last year. Segment earnings continued to benefit from operational improvements, successful new product introductions and continued conversion of value-added picture framing glass that began earlier in the fiscal year.
 
Equity in affiliates
The loss from investments in PPG Auto Glass, LLC, owned 34 percent by Apogee, was $1.5 million in the fourth quarter, versus a loss of $2.8 million in the prior-year period, reflecting improved operating performance at the windshield distribution joint venture despite challenging market conditions.
 
Financial condition
Apogee's cash flow during the quarter remained strong, as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totaled $14.5 million compared to $17.1 million in the same period last year. Long-term debt was reduced to $47.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter, from $48.5 million at the end of the third quarter and $69.1 million at the end of fiscal 2002. The company's debt-to-total-capital ratio declined to 21 percent, a significant improvement from 29 percent at the end of the prior year. Apogee repurchased approximately 356,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of $9.35, completing its 1.5 million share buyback program.
 
In the fourth quarter, depreciation and amortization totaled $6.4 million, compared with $6.8 million in the year-ago quarter. The elimination of amortization under the new method of accounting for goodwill contributed $0.01 per share to earnings in the fourth quarter and $0.05 per share for the full year. Total non-cash working capital increased to $40.8 million at the end of the quarter, versus $32.5 million at the end of fiscal 2002. Capital expenditures were $4.0 million in the quarter, compared to $3.3 million in last year's fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $12.8 million in fiscal 2003, compared with $10.5 million in the prior 12-month period.
 
Outlook
"Despite facing significant challenges in fiscal 2004, we expect to grow revenues slightly this year. The key challenges are the economic uncertainty that has now delayed the rebound in the commercial construction market from late calendar 2003 to early 2004 and the ongoing competitive environment for our auto replacement glass segment," Huffer said. "Based on the current expected timing of the commercial construction turnaround, we continue to anticipate performance in fiscal 2004 at the lower end of the guidance range of $0.85 to $0.93 per share provided earlier. For us to achieve the higher end of this range, we will need to see improved economic conditions and a more significant improvement in commercial construction than anticipated.
 
"Although our market conditions are challenging, Apogee's manufacturing operations are running better than they ever have and our cash flow remains strong," Huffer continued. "When the economy improves, our architectural segment remains well positioned to perform strongly in the construction market. We entered this downturn with solid operations that are being constantly improved, and a continued commitment to product quality, service excellence and cost reduction. To somewhat offset the impact of the slowdown, architectural segment costs were reduced by an estimated $4 million annually late in the quarter and early in the fiscal 2004 first quarter, and auto glass segment operating costs were reduced by an estimated $4.5 million annually during the fourth quarter.
 
"We also have a clearer focus on our market opportunities. We continue to see growth in our large-scale optical businesses through new products and deeper market penetration; are winning institutional
 
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

architectural projects and seeing success in penetrating protective glazing markets; and are beginning to grow retail auto glass share," said Huffer. "And, since we are at approximately 60 percent of architectural capacity, we can easily boost shipments without significant capital expenditures. The improvements we've made and our positioning should provide sustainable momentum for growth in both revenues and earnings when conditions in the commercial construction industry improve.
 
"Our significant financial strength is very beneficial in these challenging times," said Huffer. "Our EBITDA is expected to range from $65 to $68 million in fiscal 2004. We are evaluating uses for our strong cash flow beyond paying our dividend and reducing debt.
 
"Looking to the first quarter specifically, we are facing immense business and political uncertainties that are providing a very difficult backdrop against which to forecast," said Huffer. "Due to soft conditions in our key markets and the level of our current backlog, we are maintaining a wide guidance range for the first quarter, of $0.04 to $0.10 per share.
 
"In our architectural segment, we are facing an extremely challenging quarter because some committed architectural projects have been shifted to later schedules, new projects have not closed, and margins are compressing due to price erosion and the mix shift to institutional and smaller projects. We are encouraged that bidding activity has been increasing and will benefit from cost reductions already made  we will consider further reductions based upon the market outlook," he said. "We feel we have the factors that we can influence under control, and despite the economic uncertainty are working to further strengthen our commercial construction industry position through our continued emphasis on quality and service, and our focus on hurricane, protective and energy-efficient glazing products and services.
 
"Our auto glass segment will remain under pressure in the first quarter and beyond due to pricing pressures resulting from industry overcapacity. We remain focused on growing units and reducing costs in retail," he said. "The performance in large-scale optical is expected to continue to be strong, building on our progress and success in fiscal 2003."
 
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2004. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

material costs, insurance and wages. The architectural and auto glass segments are expected to face continued competitive pricing pressures due to soft market conditions.
 
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect management's current expectations or beliefs. There can be no assurances that Apogee's architectural segment, which serves high-end markets with value-added products, will not be further impacted by the continued slowed economy. In addition, there can be no assurances that Harmon AutoGlass will reverse its loss of market share or overcome pricing pressures in the challenging auto replacement glass market. There can be no assurances that PPG Auto Glass, Apogee's automotive replacement glass distribution joint venture with PPG Industries, will achieve favorable long-term operating results. There also can be no assurances that the large-scale optical segment businesses will continue to increase revenues year over year. The company cautions readers that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements depending upon the outcome of certain factors, including the risks and uncertainties identified in Exhibit 99 to the company's Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 2, 2002.

For Immediate Release
Monday, June 16, 2003
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 16, 2003)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced that first quarter fiscal 2004 earnings declined more than anticipated and full-year guidance has been reduced, due to the continuing decline in the commercial construction market.
 
Apogee's first quarter earnings were $0.01 per share or $0.3 million, compared with $0.18 per share or $5.2 million in the fiscal 2003 first quarter. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share. Revenues for the first quarter totaled $171.3 million, down 7 percent compared to revenues of $184.7 million in the same period last year.
 
"Our first quarter results were most heavily impacted by the continued decline in our architectural business," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Our earnings came in below our guidance due to greater than expected construction project delays and the lower margins experienced on short-term, fill-in work.
 
"I'm disappointed that we continue to see low levels of bid activity and slower in-bound orders in our architectural segment, which is our largest," he said. "And, as a result, we are lowering our full-year expectations to $0.50 to $0.65 per share from our previous guidance of approximately $0.85. Our revised fiscal 2004 outlook for the architectural segment includes revenues down by 5 to 7 percent and operating income down by about half compared to the prior year.
 
"This outlook is based on architectural market conditions and not our operating performance," said Huffer. "Our businesses are running as well as can be expected in this environment, and the segment has gained market share in the lag-adjusted non-residential construction market during the multi-year
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

slowdown." Apogee's businesses get involved in projects an average of nine months after work starts and thus lag behind the construction market trends.
 
Architectural products and services
First quarter revenues for Apogee's largest segment, architectural products and services, decreased due to the construction industry decline. Revenues decreased 12 percent to $94.9 million, compared to $108.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $0.9 million, compared to $6.4 million a year ago. Revenues and earnings were impacted by delays in construction projects leading to lower production levels at all businesses, as well as an increase in lower margin short-term, fill-in work. These factors were only slightly offset by the ongoing improved operating performance.
 
The architectural segment backlog was up slightly to $150.9 million, compared to $147.3 million at year-end; the backlog was $183.4 million in the first quarter of last year.
 
Automotive replacement glass and services
Automotive segment revenues for the first quarter were $60.6 million, flat compared to $60.4 million in the prior-year period. The segment reported operating income of $1.8 million, down from $4.7 million in the prior-year period. The prior year included gains of $1.4 million from asset sales. At retail, units increased more than 20 percent driven by new business, and pricing declined approximately 13 percent due to industry conditions and business mix, compared to the same period last year. In addition, pricing at our manufacturing location continued to erode and was down approximately 15 percent from the year-ago quarter.
 
Large-scale optical technologies
First quarter large-scale optical segment revenues were $15.7 million, down 4 percent compared to revenues of $16.4 million in the prior-year period, due to the short-term slowdown in retail markets served by the segment driven by economic uncertainties. The segment had an operating loss of $0.4 million, showing improvement from an operating loss of $0.9 million in the same period last year. The segment continues to benefit from prior-year operational improvements and new product introductions, as well as from the ongoing conversion of the retail picture framing market to higher value-added glass.
 
Equity in affiliates
Apogee's loss from investments in PPG Auto Glass, LLC, owned 34 percent by Apogee, was $0.6 million in the first quarter, versus a loss of $1.1 million in the prior-year period. This reflects increased volume and improved operating performance, somewhat offset by declining pricing for the windshield distribution joint venture, despite challenging market conditions.
 
Financial condition
Long-term debt was $51.7 million at the end of the first quarter, up from $47.3 million at year-end as anticipated, due to seasonal working capital needs. The company's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 22 percent at the end of the quarter, compared to 21 percent at the end of fiscal 2003. In the first quarter, depreciation and amortization totaled $6.2 million, compared with $6.1 million in the same period last year. Non-cash working capital increased to $56.5 million at the end of the quarter, versus $40.8 million at the end of fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures were $1.1 million in the quarter, versus $3.4 million in the prior-year period.

Outlook
"The delay in the construction turnaround has led us to reduce our outlook for fiscal 2004," Huffer said. "Our customers have been delaying projects, and we're not seeing the increases in bidding activity and inbound order rates necessary to drive strong improvement in our second half performance. We continue to pursue short-term, fill-in work but don't anticipate that we'll be able to completely offset the lower levels of commercial construction activity.
 
"Construction industry indicators also show the slowdown continuing, declining further since our last earnings release in April," he said. "F.W. Dodge, a leading industry forecaster, now expects the non-residential construction market to decline 2 percent in calendar 2003. And, of greater concern, commercial office construction is off more than 40 percent from its calendar 2000 peak. Dodge's outlook for calendar 2004 total non-residential construction is improvement of 6 percent over 2003, with office work up 16 percent.
 
"We did cut costs in our architectural and auto glass segments at the end of last year and the first quarter of the current year, and are looking at our company-wide cost structure and expect to make further reductions," he said.
 
"In light of the uncertain architectural outlook, we're forecasting second quarter earnings of $0.14 to $0.18 per share and full-year earnings of $0.50 to $0.65," said Huffer.
 
"I remain encouraged by the ongoing improvements we're achieving in our operations, including the reductions in lead-time in the architectural businesses," he said. "All of our companies are aggressively pursuing market opportunities, ranging from hurricane and protective glazing for the architectural businesses to international markets for picture framing and insurance company customers for auto glass retail. These efforts are key to our long-term performance.
 
"We cannot wait for the construction industry to turn before initiating growth strategies," Huffer said. "Therefore, we have engaged external resources to assist us in achieving more profitable growth. It is imperative that we continue working to enhance shareholder value, despite the market challenges we are facing.
 
"We'll continue to use our positive cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet by further reducing our debt during fiscal 2004 and we intend to start executing our new share repurchase program," said Huffer.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 10, 2003)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced that it is in discussions to sell its retail auto replacement glass business, Harmon AutoGlass, as part of its long-term strategic realignment to focus on growth opportunities in its architectural and large-scale optical segments.
 
Apogee has engaged Lazard Freres & Co. to assist with the sale of the retail auto glass operations; a transaction is anticipated to close before the end of fiscal 2004 (February 28, 2004).
 
"This anticipated transaction will allow Apogee management to increase our focus on opportunities in our architectural glass products and services, and picture framing glass businesses where we have solid market positions and greater opportunities for profitable growth," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We expect to make announcements related to our strategic refocus during the second half of fiscal 2004.
 
"Apogee's roots are in the retail auto glass business, which made significant contributions to the company in past years," he said. "But with the changes in market conditions, we believe Harmon AutoGlass is no longer a strategic fit for Apogee. Accordingly, we are aggressively pursuing the sale of Harmon AutoGlass to a buyer dedicated to the auto replacement glass industry, including auto glass insurance claims management. We believe Harmon AutoGlass can more effectively compete in a new ownership structure. We feel this will be a positive decision for Apogee and its shareholders, and for Harmon AutoGlass and its new owner, which will benefit from Harmon AutoGlass' industry-leading installation technicians and customer service."
 
To exit this business, Apogee expects to incur an after-tax charge of $6 to $10 million, or $0.22 to $0.36 per share, during fiscal 2004 for the transaction, transition and related restructuring costs.

Apogee expects to record $4 to $6 million of the charge in the fiscal 2004 second quarter, ended August 30, due to a reduction of the carrying value of Harmon AutoGlass.
 
Apogee will account for the anticipated sale of Harmon AutoGlass as a discontinued business on its consolidated financial statements. Historical financial results after the impact of discontinued operations are included in this release.
 
With the anticipated sale of Harmon AutoGlass, Apogee's automotive replacement glass and services segment will now include only its windshield manufacturing business. PPG Auto Glass, LLC, owned 34 percent by Apogee, will continue to be reported in equity in affiliates.
 
"Regarding second quarter results, which will be reported after the market closes on September 17, we anticipate that our earnings will be from $0.10 to $0.11 per share, excluding the Harmon AutoGlass impairment charge. This range does include Harmon AutoGlass operating results," said Huffer. "Our earnings will be slightly below previous quarterly guidance of $0.14 to $0.18 per share due primarily to a $0.02 per share one-time charge largely resulting from the closure of a small satellite architectural paint finishing facility in Atlanta, as well as a revenue shortfall at Harmon AutoGlass."
 
In its second quarter release next week, Apogee will provide updated fiscal year 2004 guidance that includes the impact of reporting Harmon AutoGlass as a discontinued operation and the related transaction charges.

Exhibit 99.1
 
NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, September 17, 2003
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 17, 2003)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced second quarter results, revised its guidance to reflect the anticipated sale of Harmon AutoGlass, announced September 10, and lowered full-year guidance.
 
Apogee had previously provided guidance of $0.14 to $0.18 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Excluding Harmon AutoGlass, Apogee's second quarter guidance for continuing operations would have ranged from $0.10 to $0.12 per share.
 
Apogee reported second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.09, or $2.5 million, which includes a charge of $0.01 per share, or $0.5 million, resulting from the closure of a small satellite architectural paint finishing facility in Atlanta. This compares to earnings from continuing operations of $0.25 per share, or $7.1 million, in the prior-year period. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share. Prior-year results have been reclassified to reflect Harmon AutoGlass as a discontinued operation.
 
Second quarter net results were a loss of $0.07 per share, or $1.9 million, compared with net earnings of $0.30 per share, or $8.6 million, in the previous-year period. This reflects a loss of $0.16 per share from discontinued operations in the second quarter, which includes a charge of $0.18 per share, or $5.0 million, due to reduction of the carrying value of Harmon AutoGlass.
 
Second quarter revenues from continuing operations totaled $135.8 million, down 8 percent compared to revenues of $147.8 million in the same period last year.
 
"Although our earnings from continuing operations were slightly below expectations, we are pleased that the large-scale optical segment second quarter revenues were slightly ahead of expectations due to
 
stronger than anticipated growth in sales of value-added picture framing glass and anti-reflective acrylic products," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Architectural revenues for the quarter were generally down with the market. In addition, margins in our glass installation business were negatively impacted due to some isolated project management issues, and we have implemented improved processes to address these issues.
 
"Our cash flow remains solid," said Huffer. "Even though we were slightly below our guidance and recorded the discontinued operations charges, we still reduced our long-term debt by more than $10 million from the first quarter, ending the second quarter at $40.4 million.
 
"Looking at the remainder of the year, although we are starting to see indications that the decline in some sectors of the commercial construction market may be ending, the turnaround is not occurring as quickly as we had originally anticipated," he said. "This challenging architectural environment continues to lead to project delays, and we had some project management issues, reducing our revenues and putting pressure on our margins. As a result, we are lowering full-year guidance for continuing operations by $0.08 per share to $0.38 to $0.50, from $0.46 to $0.58 per share adjusted for the treatment of Harmon AutoGlass as a discontinued operation. Prior guidance before the discontinued operations adjustment was $0.50 to $0.65 per share. New full-year net earnings guidance including anticipated charges in discontinued operations is $0.04 to $0.27 per share."
 
Architectural products and services
 
Second quarter revenues for Apogee's largest segment, architectural products and services, continued to decrease as a result of the ongoing construction industry decline. Revenues were down 11 percent to $103.5 million, compared to $115.7 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $0.9 million, compared to $8.4 million a year ago, primarily due to margin decreases resulting from isolated project management issues in the glass installation business and lower capacity utilization. Architectural results also were impacted by the charge from closing a small finishing facility.
 
The architectural segment backlog increased to $181.2 million, compared to $150.9 million at the end of the first quarter; the backlog was $163.2 million in the second quarter of last year. The majority of the backlog increase was from the installation business, with the other architectural businesses holding flat.
 
Large-scale optical technologies
 
Second quarter large-scale optical segment revenues were $21.2 million, up 6 percent compared to revenues of $20.1 million in the prior-year period, as a result of growth in picture framing glass sales as the conversion to value-added products continues, and increased sales of anti-reflective acrylic products. The segment had operating income of $1.3 million, up significantly from $0.4 million in the same period last year, due to the continued impact of operational improvements and conversion to value-added picture framing glass.
 
Automotive replacement glass and services
 
Auto glass segment revenues for the second quarter, which now reflect only the manufacturing business, were $11.1 million, down slightly compared to $11.9 million in the prior-year period. The segment reported operating income of $1.6 million, down from $2.7 million in the prior-year period as a result of manufacturing pricing that declined approximately 15 percent compared to a year ago.
 
Equity in affiliates
 
Apogee's income from investments in PPG Auto Glass, LLC, owned 34 percent by Apogee, was $0.6 million in the second quarter, versus a loss of $0.1 million in the prior-year period. This reflects improved operating performance, despite challenging market conditions.
 
Discontinued operations
 
Apogee's second quarter discontinued operations results, which reflect the planned sale of Harmon AutoGlass, were a loss of $0.16 per share, or $4.4 million, compared with earnings of $0.05 per share, or $1.5 million, in the fiscal 2003 period. Fiscal 2004 results include a valuation charge of $0.18 per share, or $5.0 million, related to the anticipated sale of Harmon AutoGlass. Operating results of the retail auto glass unit in the second quarter were below that of the prior year, as unit growth of 17 percent was offset by a 14 percent pricing decline.
 
Apogee announced on September 10 that it is in discussions to sell Harmon AutoGlass as part of its long-term strategic realignment to focus on opportunities in the company's architectural glass products and services, and picture framing glass businesses. Apogee has engaged Lazard Freres & Co. to assist with the sale of the retail auto glass operations; a transaction is anticipated to close before the end of the fiscal year on February 28, 2004.
 
Financial condition
 
Long-term debt was $40.4 million at the end of the second quarter, down from $51.7 million at the end of the first quarter and $47.3 million at year-end. The company's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 19 percent at the end of the quarter, compared to 21 percent at the end of fiscal 2003. Non-cash working capital (current assets less current liabilities less cash) decreased to $49.7 million at the end of the quarter, from $56.5 million at the end of the first quarter. Year to date, depreciation and amortization for continuing operations totaled $10.2 million, compared to $10.3 million in the first half of fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $3.0 million year to date, versus $5.1 million in the prior-year period.
 
Outlook
 
"We expect fiscal 2004 to be a pivotal year in repositioning Apogee for a stronger future," said Huffer. "The planned sale of Harmon AutoGlass will allow Apogee management to increase our focus on opportunities in our architectural glass products and services, and picture framing glass businesses where we have solid market positions and greater opportunities for growth.
 
"While we weather the construction industry slowdown, we are initiating growth strategies for current products, services and capacities in un-served and underserved markets," said Huffer. "We are focused on opportunities in architectural glass products and services, and picture framing glass. We've made the most progress, to date, on the framing glass initiative and are focused on growing the current business while developing plans for achieving new growth from the international, institutional fine art and retail do-it-yourself markets. At the same time, we're in the process of identifying and defining growth opportunities for architectural glass products and services. We are excited about our strategic refocus initiatives and expect to make announcements related to these efforts during the second half of fiscal 2004.
 
"We had previously expected to see improvement in our architectural revenues in the third quarter but are now anticipating growth in the fourth quarter, based on bid activity and in-bound order rates in our businesses," he said. "Despite the difficult commercial construction industry conditions, our architectural segment is out-performing its served markets. The commercial construction market rebound is still expected to begin late in calendar year 2004, based on F.W. Dodge forecasts.
 
"We are pleased that our large-scale optical segment continues to grow at anticipated rates, thanks largely to the ongoing success in converting the custom picture framing market to value-added glass product," he said.
 
"We'll continue to use our positive cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet by further reducing our debt during fiscal 2004, and continuing to pay our dividend," said Huffer. "However, we don't anticipate repurchasing stock under our current share repurchase program until we have closed on the auto glass transaction."
 
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2004. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
performance is expected to be approximately break even for the year. At this time, we do not anticipate any income or loss from resolution of liabilities associated with discontinued European curtainwall operations.

For Immediate Release
November 4, 2003
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (November 4, 2003)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the stock of Harmon AutoGlass, its retail auto replacement glass business, to Synergistic International, Inc., doing business as Glass Doctor, a subsidiary of The Dwyer Group.
 
The transaction is expected to close by December 31, 2003, subject to customary conditions. Terms were not disclosed.
 
"This sale will allow Apogee management to increase our focus on opportunities in our architectural glass products and services, and picture framing glass businesses where we have solid market positions and greater opportunities for profitable growth," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Although Apogee's roots are in the retail auto glass business, Harmon AutoGlass is no longer a strategic fit for Apogee due to changes in its market conditions. We feel this is a positive decision for Apogee and its shareholders, and for Harmon AutoGlass.
 
"The sale is an attractive opportunity for Glass Doctor, which currently provides auto replacement glass services through more than 100 locations nationally," he said. "They are dedicated to this industry, including participation in auto glass insurance claims management."
 
"Harmon AutoGlass, respected for its quality installation technicians and customer service, will complement our current Glass Doctor family and allow us to be a stronger national
 
competitor," said Dina Dwyer-Owens, president and chief executive officer of The Dwyer Group. "In addition, we will also be able to effectively compete for national insurance business with the addition of the Harmon AutoGlass shops and expertise in servicing these accounts." Glass Doctor plans to convert the majority of the purchased facilities to franchises.
 
Apogee is now reporting Harmon AutoGlass in discontinued operations, which will reflect a charge of $0.25 to $0.32 per share, or $7 to $9 million, in fiscal 2004 for the transaction and transition costs of exiting retail auto glass, as previously stated. Apogee anticipates that the transaction will be neutral from a cash flow perspective. This includes the charge of $0.18 per share or $5.0 million taken in the second quarter.

For Immediate Release
Wednesday, December 17, 2003
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 17, 2003)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today reported third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.20, or $5.5 million, including the favorable effect of a reduction in the company's effective tax rate. This compares to earnings from continuing operations of $0.35 per share, or $9.9 million, in the prior-year period. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.
 
Third quarter net earnings were $0.09 per share, or $2.5 million, compared with net earnings of $0.27 per share, or $7.6 million, in the previous-year period. This reflects a loss of $0.11 per share from discontinued operations in the third quarter, versus a loss of $0.08 in the prior-year period.
 
Third quarter revenues from continuing operations declined 7 percent as expected and totaled $143.6 million compared to revenues of $154.4 million in the same period last year.
 
"We met our overall expectations in the third quarter, despite the ongoing, difficult commercial construction environment," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman, president and chief executive officer. "Architectural revenues for the quarter were down from prior year as anticipated, due to the slow construction market, and expected earnings were somewhat impacted by project delays and by lower margins on isolated jobs previously identified as having project management issues.
 
"Our large-scale optical segment continues to successfully convert picture framers to value-added glass," he said. "Auto glass segment results were better than anticipated due to higher than expected manufacturing shipments in the quarter, a timing issue that will be reflected in lower shipments in the fourth quarter."
 
Architectural products and services
Third quarter revenues for Apogee's largest segment, architectural products and services, continued to be below the prior year as expected, due to the soft commercial construction market overall and specifically the office sector, usually Apogee's largest market. Revenues were down 11 percent to $109.0 million, compared to $121.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating income was $1.7 million, compared to $10.8 million a year ago. Lower volume and competitive pricing continue to contribute to the lower architectural operating earnings; further impacting operating income in the quarter were projects shifting to later start dates in the window and curtainwall business, and ongoing margin pressures in isolated glass installation projects.
 
The architectural segment backlog increased to $209.1 million. The third quarter backlog compares to $181.2 million at the end of the second quarter and a backlog of $147.3 million in the prior-year period. The majority of the growth in the backlogs of all architectural businesses is expected to be shipped in fiscal 2005.
 
Large-scale optical technologies
Third quarter large-scale optical segment revenues were $22.0 million, up 2 percent compared to revenues of $21.6 million in the prior-year period. The segment had operating income of $2.5 million, up from $1.8 million in the same period last year. Earnings benefited from the continued conversion to value-added picture framing glass and operational improvements, partially offset by ongoing pricing pressures in consumer electronics and clear glass picture framing products.
 
Automotive replacement glass and services
Auto glass segment revenues for the third quarter, which now reflect only the manufacturing business, were $12.6 million, versus $11.0 million in the soft prior-year period. The segment reported operating income of $2.8 million, up from $2.2 million in the prior-year period due to improved volume and ongoing operating improvements, partially offset by manufacturing pricing that declined approximately 12 percent compared to a year ago.
 
Equity in affiliates
Apogee's loss from investments in PPG Auto Glass, LLC was $0.8 million in the third quarter, versus earnings of $0.3 million in the prior-year period. Performance at the joint venture, although slightly better than expected, continues to be impacted by replacement auto glass pricing pressures.
 
Discontinued operations
Apogee's third quarter discontinued operations results, which reflect the planned sale of Harmon AutoGlass, were a loss of $0.11 per share, or $3.0 million, compared with a loss of $0.08 per share, or $2.3 million, in the fiscal 2003 period. Third quarter results include charges of $1.3 million related to the anticipated sale of Harmon AutoGlass. In addition, retail auto glass unit operating results were below expectations as an 11 percent increase in units was offset by an 11 percent decline in pricing compared to the prior-year period.
 
Apogee announced on November 4 that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell the stock of Harmon AutoGlass to Synergistic International, Inc., doing business as Glass Doctor, a subsidiary of The Dwyer Group. The transaction is expected to close by early January 2004.
 
Financial condition
Long-term debt was $41.7 million at the end of the third quarter, up slightly from $40.4 million at the end of the second quarter and down from $47.3 million at year-end. The company's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 19 percent at the end of the quarter, compared to 21 percent at the end of fiscal 2003. Non-cash working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less current liabilities) increased to $57.1 million at the end of the quarter, from $49.7 million at the end of the second quarter due to a seasonal increase in accounts receivable as well as a planned inventory buildup of value-added picture framing glass. Year to date, depreciation and amortization for continuing operations totaled $15.1 million, compared to $15.2 million in fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures for continuing operations were $7.8 million year to date, even with $7.8 million in the prior-year period.
 
Third quarter results benefited by $0.06 cents per share, or $1.6 million, due to favorable impacts of constant tax deductions and credits relative to a reduced base of pretax income, and additional deductions from an intellectual property donation.
 
Outlook
"Looking ahead, we are excited about the ongoing opportunities for our large-scale optical segment," said Huffer. "Our efforts to convert picture framing markets to value-added glass products continue to be successful, and we are planning for even greater penetration in existing and new framing markets as we continue to transition our coating capacity that today is serving consumer electronics markets to picture framing. At the same time, we are determining ways to streamline costs in this segment.
 
"Although the fourth quarter and fiscal 2005 remain challenging for our architectural segment, we are starting to see some positive trends," Huffer said. "Our inbound order rates for architectural glass fabrication and windows and curtainwall have improved in the last few months. In addition, our backlog has grown almost 40 percent over the past two quarters, although this new work will largely be shipped in fiscal 2005. We're definitely winning more business in tough market conditions.
 
"The latest industry forecasts from F.W. Dodge predict a 4.0 percent increase in the total non-residential market in calendar 2004," he said, "and an increase of 9.6 percent in our key office sector, after an expected decline of 8.8 percent in calendar 2003. However, because the timing of our products and services lags construction project starts by about nine months, we don't expect to see this growth benefiting our architectural businesses until late in fiscal 2005 or early in fiscal 2006.
 
"We'll continue to use our positive cash flow this year to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing our debt, and continuing to pay our dividend," said Huffer. "We expect to begin repurchasing stock under our current share repurchase program during the fourth quarter.
 
"This year is pivotal in repositioning Apogee for a stronger future through our strategies for growing our architectural glass products and services, and picture framing glass businesses. In the short term, we are executing strategies related to the conversion of the picture framing market to value-added glass products. Once the sale of Harmon AutoGlass is completed, we'll be able to give our other growth strategies our full attention," he said. "We feel that our architectural segment, with its industry-leading value-added products and services, is positioned to perform well despite the market outlook."
 
He continued, "For fiscal 2004, the continuing slowdown in commercial construction markets and the high likelihood of project delays are driving us to the low end of our previous guidance range of $0.38 to $0.50 per share for continuing operations." This does not include a $0.05 one-time reduction in auto
 
glass segment earnings in the fourth quarter as a result of amending the existing PPG Auto Glass joint venture pricing amendments to better reflect market pricing, and potential one-time charges as we evaluate the needs of the organization after the divestiture of Harmon AutoGlass.
 
"We plan to provide our fiscal 2005 guidance during the fourth quarter after we close on the sale of Harmon AutoGlass," he said.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN (January 2, 2004)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced it has completed the sale of the stock of Harmon AutoGlass, its retail auto replacement glass business, to Synergistic International, Inc., doing business as Glass Doctor, a subsidiary of The Dwyer Group. Terms were not disclosed.
 
Apogee had previously announced that it had entered a definite purchase agreement with Glass Doctor, as part of its long-term strategic realignment to focus on opportunities in the company's architectural glass products and services, and picture framing glass businesses.
 
"We're pleased that a leader in the auto replacement glass industry, Glass Doctor, will be taking Harmon AutoGlass to a new level of competitiveness," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman, president and chief executive officer. "I would like to thank the Harmon AutoGlass employees for their significant contributions to Apogee over the years."
 
Apogee began reporting Harmon AutoGlass in discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Full-year discontinued operations are expected to reflect a charge of $0.25 to $0.32 per share, or $7 to $9 million, for the transaction and transition costs of exiting retail auto glass. Apogee anticipates that the transaction will be neutral from a cash flow perspective.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
For Immediate Release
Monday, February 2, 2004
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (February 2, 2004)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced it has lowered earnings guidance for its fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, ending February 28.
 
The revised guidance for fourth quarter continuing operations is a loss of $0.08 to $0.11 per share, including restructuring charges of $0.02 to $0.03 per share related to the integration of Apogee's two large-scale optical segment businesses. The expected operating losses are somewhat offset by the net tax benefit. The previous guidance for the fourth quarter was earnings from continuing operations of $0.03 to $0.06 per share prior to restructuring charges. The new full-year guidance is a range of earnings of $0.19 to $0.22 per share from continuing operations, versus the previous earnings guidance of $0.33 per share from continuing operations.
 
"Our outlook for continuing operations in the last quarter of the year has declined, primarily due to our continuing difficulty in accurately predicting job timing and flow," said Russell Huffer, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We had approximately $14 to $17 million in revenues shift from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 into fiscal 2005 as a result of project delays and adjustments to project timing and flow, which is expected to reduce operating income by $2.8 to $4.8 million in the quarter. We have not seen any decline in our backlog, just timing movement, a situation most predominant in our curtainwall and window manufacturing and installation businesses.
 
"The fourth quarter results will include $1.0 to $1.5 million in pre-tax, restructuring charges resulting from strategic initiatives to grow our picture framing business," said Huffer. "In the process of combining our two large-scale optical segment businesses, Tru Vue and Viratec, to more efficiently serve the promising picture framing markets, we're incurring severance, an I/T system write-off and other costs.

"Our efforts to convert picture framing markets to value-added glass products continue to be successful, and we are planning for even greater penetration in existing and new framing markets as we continue to transition our coating capacity that today is serving consumer electronics markets to picture framing," he said. "We're focused on growing value-added glass products in our traditional custom framing market, while we start to penetrate the institutional fine art, international and do-it-yourself markets. Our picture framing strategies are designed to not only drive growth in picture framing glass but reduce the overhead run rate for the combined business by an estimated $3 million annually beginning in mid-fiscal 2005.
 
"As part of this integration, Larry Stordahl, Apogee executive vice president, who has been serving as interim president of our Viratec coating business, has announced he will be retiring at the end of this fiscal year," said Huffer. "As an Apogee officer for the past five years, Larry has been instrumental in driving and supporting operational improvements as well as our Six Sigma/Lean and marketing initiatives. I especially appreciate the leadership he has provided to many Apogee business units during this time of great change for the company.
 
"As we've stated, we've been focused on developing and implementing strategies for growing our architectural glass, architectural products and services, and picture framing glass product lines. These strategies are designed to help grow our core businesses, obtain new revenues from extensions of these businesses, and achieve higher profitability on our revenues," said Huffer.
 
"In a separate release today, we announced a management change to support execution of our strategic plan, including improvements in our curtainwall and window, and installation businesses," he said. "Our goal is to enhance shareholder value through this focus on our strategies, and architectural products and services businesses."
 
Key to repositioning Apogee for growth was the January 2004 sale of Harmon AutoGlass, which is reported in discontinued operations for fiscal 2004. The full-year results for discontinued operations are expected to be a loss of $0.37 to $0.44 per share, which includes charges of $0.25 to $0.32 per share for the transaction and transition costs of exiting retail auto glass.
 
"We will be providing guidance for fiscal 2005 when we announce our fiscal 2004 fourth quarter and full-year results in early April," Huffer said. "In addition, by that time we will have completed an evaluation of a realignment of our overhead costs to better serve our growth opportunities and improve returns. We plan to incorporate our reduction and realignment objectives as part of our fiscal 2005 guidance.
 
"Although the backlog for our largest segment, architectural products and services, has increased 40 percent over the past two quarters, we have seen an increasing number of project delays and the current backlog carries lower margins than we've experienced in the past. Despite these challenges and industry forecasts that call for a down year for our fiscal 2005, based on our backlog, projects and activities, we could see 4 to 7 percent revenue growth for this segment in the new fiscal year with stabilization in project timing. Our fiscal 2005 correlates to F.W. Dodge calendar 2003 forecasts because the timing of our products and services lags construction project starts by about nine months.
 
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

"The latest industry outlook from Dodge for calendar 2003 forecasts that the total non-residential market was down 2.2 percent, while our key office sector was down 8.8 percent," he said. "The calendar 2004 forecast, which impacts our fiscal 2006, is for an increase of 4.0 percent for total non-residential and an increase of 9.6 percent for the office sector."
 
The net tax benefit for the fiscal 2004 full year is anticipated to be $1.8 to $2.5 million. This full-year net tax benefit is the result of favorable impacts of constant tax deductions and credits relative to a low base of pre-tax income.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, April 7, 2004
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (April 7, 2004)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced fiscal 2004 full-year and fourth quarter earnings.
 
For the 12-month period ended February 28, 2004, Apogee's earnings from continuing operations were $0.17 per share or $4.6 million, compared with $1.02 per share or $28.9 million a year ago. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share. Fiscal 2004 net results, which include charges resulting from the sale of Harmon AutoGlass in January 2004 as well as operating losses at the unit, were a loss of $0.20 per share, or $5.6 million, compared to prior-year net earnings of $1.06 per share or $29.9 million. Revenues from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 were $535.3 million, down 8 percent from $584.9 million last year.
 
"The ongoing slowdown in commercial construction markets significantly impacted our performance this past fiscal year," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "During this challenging year, we developed and started to implement new initiatives designed to grow our strategic architectural products and services, and picture framing glass product lines. Our goal is to improve our business performance through our strategies during a cyclical down market for our largest segment, architectural.
 
"Apogee's earnings from continuing operations were consistent with our early February guidance of $0.19 to $0.22 per share, excluding charges of $0.03 per share related to the sale of our non-strategic picture framing matboard product line; an agreement to sell the line was signed the last week of the fiscal year," he said. "Our net results, which include discontinued operations, were a loss primarily related to the sale of Harmon AutoGlass, a key step in the strategic repositioning of our company.
 
"Our large-scale optical segment continued to successfully convert the picture framing industry to its value-added products," Huffer said. "Results were impacted by charges taken in the fourth quarter related to the integration of the two businesses in the segment and the sale of the non-strategic matboard product line completed in March 2004, moves designed to increase focus on our profitable picture framing glass products.
 
"A significant portion of our fiscal 2004 operating earnings came from our windshield manufacturing business, which provides the majority of its production under a supply agreement that ends in July 2005," he said. "We are in discussions regarding a new supply agreement.
 
"Despite our difficult year, we increased our dividend 4.4 percent, funded $1.3 million in share repurchases and reduced our long-term debt by $7.6 million to $39.7 million at year end," he said.
 
Fourth quarter results
 
Apogee reported a fourth quarter loss from continuing operations of $0.14 per share, or $3.7 million, versus earnings of $0.27 per share, or $7.5 million, in the prior-year period. Fourth quarter revenues of $134.5 million were down 8 percent as expected, compared to revenues of $145.9 million in the same period last year.
 
The net loss in the fiscal 2004 fourth quarter was $0.24 per share or $6.5 million, versus net earnings of $0.31 per share, or $8.5 million in the prior-year period as Apogee absorbed charges related to its strategic repositioning initiatives. Fourth quarter discontinued operations reported a loss of $0.10 per share, or $2.8 million, compared with earnings of $0.04 per share, or $1.0 million, in the fiscal 2003 period, due to charges related to the sale of Harmon AutoGlass and operating losses.
 
"As we had anticipated, significant construction project delays, along with challenging job margins, impacted architectural segment results," said Huffer. "Also contributing to the quarter's continuing operations losses were pre-tax charges of $1.7 million resulting from the sale of our matboard product line, completed March 31, 2004, and the integration of our two large-scale optical businesses to better serve picture framing markets, as well as a $1.4 million one-time reduction in autoglass segment earnings due to previously-discussed pricing amendments."
 
Architectural products and services
 
Fourth quarter revenues for Apogee's largest segment, architectural products and services, continued to be below the prior year as expected, due to the soft commercial construction market overall and specifically the office sector, usually Apogee's largest market. Revenues were down 8 percent to $104.0 million, compared to $113.2 million in the prior-year quarter. There was an operating loss of $4.1 million, compared to earnings of $6.5 million a year ago. As had been anticipated in our previous guidance, approximately $16 million in fourth quarter revenues shifted into fiscal 2005 as a result of project delays and adjustments to project timing and flow. This revenue shortfall, along with margin issues on isolated projects in the installation and window and curtainwall manufacturing businesses, led to the segment operating loss.
 
The architectural segment backlog increased to $224.5 million, up more than 50 percent from a year ago. The fourth quarter backlog compares to $209.1 million at the end of the third quarter and a backlog of $147.3 million in the prior-year period. All segment businesses contributed to the fourth-quarter increase in the backlog.
Large-scale optical technologies
 
Fourth quarter large-scale optical segment revenues were $20.4 million, down 6 percent compared to revenues of $21.7 million in the prior-year period. Revenues were slightly below expectations due to lower sales in consumer electronics markets. The segment had an operating loss of $0.7 million, compared to operating income of $2.4 million in an unusually strong prior-year period. Impacting fiscal 2004 fourth quarter earnings were $0.6 million in pre-tax restructuring charges as the two businesses in the segment are integrated and $1.1 million in charges related to the sale of the matboard product line, completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
 
Automotive replacement glass and services
 
Auto glass segment revenues for the fourth quarter, which reflect only the manufacturing business, were $10.1 million, versus $11.1 million in the prior-year period. The segment reported operating income of $1.4 million, down from $3.7 million in the prior-year period. This was primarily due to amending the existing PPG Auto Glass joint venture pricing amendments to better reflect market pricing, which resulted in a one-time reduction of $1.4 million. Overall manufacturing pricing declined approximately 7 percent compared to a year ago on flat volume. Apogee has received the required advance notice from PPG Industries that its windshield supply agreement will be terminated on the expiration date in July 2005, which is during fiscal 2006, and is in discussions regarding a new supply agreement. This is not expected to impact fiscal 2005 earnings.
 
Equity in affiliates
 
Apogee's loss from investments in PPG Auto Glass, LLC was $2.3 million in the fourth quarter, versus a loss of $1.6 million in the prior-year period. This joint venture performance reflects reduced volume and ongoing replacement auto glass market pricing pressures, slightly offset by improved operating performance.
 
Discontinued operations
 
Fourth quarter discontinued operations reported a loss of $0.10 per share, or $2.8 million, compared with earnings of $0.04 per share, or $1.0 million, in the fiscal 2003 period. The current quarter results include an after-tax charge of $2.3 million related to the sale of Harmon AutoGlass, as well as operating losses prior to the closing on January 2, 2004, but no adjustments for European discontinued operations. Prior-year period discontinued operations included after-tax income of $3.6 million from discontinued European curtainwall operations, offset by the performance of Harmon AutoGlass.
 
For the full-year, discontinued operations had a loss of $0.37 per share, or $10.2 million, compared to earnings of $0.04 or $1.0 million the prior year.
 
Financial condition
 
Long-term debt was $39.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter, down from $41.7 million at the end of the third quarter and $47.3 million at the end of fiscal 2003. The company's debt-to-total-capital ratio was 19 percent at the end of the year, compared to 21 percent at the end of the prior year. Non-cash working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less current liabilities) increased slightly to $59.4 million at the end of the quarter, from $57.1 million at the end of the third quarter. For fiscal 2004, depreciation and amortization for continuing operations totaled $19.7 million, compared to $20.8 million in fiscal 2003. Full-year capital expenditures for continuing operations were $11.5 million, even with $11.2 million in the prior year.
Full-year results benefited by $0.13 per share, or $3.6 million, due to favorable impacts of constant tax deductions and credits relative to a reduced base of pre-tax income, and additional deductions from an intellectual property donation.
 
Outlook
 
"We are anticipating a better performance in fiscal 2005 than we delivered this past year due to our stronger architectural backlog, improving performance in our glass installation business and success with our picture framing glass strategies," said Huffer. "We are continuing to face uncertainty, though, as we enter the year since the commercial construction markets have yet to begin a sustained rebound. As a result, our guidance for fiscal 2005 is earnings from continuing operations ranging from $0.30 to $0.50 per share, with our architectural segment being the key driver within this wide range.
 
"The low end of the range reflects flat markets for our architectural segment but some increased penetration in the education, health care and government sectors served, as well as a continuation of the current rate of project delays," said Huffer. "To achieve the high end of our guidance range, we'll need to see overall market improvement of the 4 percent F.W. Dodge is calling for over calendar 2004, which will impact us late in our fiscal year, and stabilization of project timing. Also impacting our performance within the range is the rate at which we improve the predictability and performance of our glass installation business.
 
"A key metric to measure our architectural progress is our backlog, which currently provides a solid level of work for us in the first half of fiscal 2005. We are starting out this fiscal year with a much larger backlog than we had last year as our markets have somewhat stabilized, and our goal is to continue year-over-year growth in the architectural backlog," he said.
 
"The large-scale optical segment will continue to convert picture framers to use of value-added glass, with sales of these products expected to grow 10 to 15 percent in fiscal 2005," he said. "However, we anticipate revenues for the segment will be flat with our strategic sale of the low-margin matboard product line and exit from low-margin consumer electronics coatings. As the segment continues to sell a greater proportion of value-added framing glass, rather than other lower-margin products, we expect our profitability will continue to improve.
 
"Although fiscal 2005 remains challenging for our architectural segment, we are starting to see some positive trends," Huffer said. "Our inbound order rates for architectural glass fabrication and windows and curtainwall have improved in the last few months. Our backlog has grown more than 50 percent over the past year, which is clear evidence that we are winning more business in tough market conditions. I am encouraged that we are seeing stability in pricing and margins in the architectural segment.
 
"Apogee's expectations for architectural revenue growth in fiscal 2005 surpass the industry outlook for the year," he said. "The latest industry forecasts from F.W. Dodge called for the total non-residential market to be down 2.2 percent, with our important office sector declining 8.8 percent. These Dodge calendar 2003 forecasts correlate to Apogee's fiscal 2005 because the timing of our products and services lags construction project starts by about nine months. The calendar 2004 forecast, which impacts Apogee in late fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, is for an increase of 4.0 percent for total non-residential and 9.6 percent for the office sector.
"We'll continue to use our positive cash flow to pay our dividend, fund capital spending and finance our growth as markets improve," said Huffer. "Other uses for cash, including debt reduction and stock repurchases, will be considered in conjunction with strategic opportunities, including expansions in value-added architectural glass and storefront markets.
 
"This year will be pivotal in repositioning Apogee for a stronger future through our strategies for growing our architectural products and services, and picture framing glass businesses. These strategies are designed to help grow our core businesses, obtain new revenues from extensions of these businesses, and achieve higher profitability on our revenues," he said. "In addition, we have incorporated in our fiscal 2005 guidance $5 million in pre-tax overhead savings from consolidating our large-scale optical businesses and streamlining our glass installation management organization. These efforts are part of a larger initiative to realign overhead costs to better serve our growth opportunities and improve returns."
 
Huffer noted that for fiscal 2005 Apogee will be providing annual guidance, and not quarterly expectations, due to the unpredictability of architectural markets and project flow timing.

"Given the stronger first quarter for our architectural segment and the continued growth in this segment's backlog, we are increasing the low end of our fiscal 2005 guidance range to $0.35 per share, while holding the high end at $0.50 per share since the commercial construction markets we serve have not yet shown a sustained rebound," said Huffer.

For Immediate Release
Wednesday, September 15, 2004
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 15, 2004)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), today announced fiscal 2005 second quarter earnings. Apogee develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.

Second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.16 per share, or $4.3 million, versus earnings of $0.09 per share, or $2.5 million, in the prior-year period. Revenues were $151.0 million, compared to revenues of $135.8 million in the same period last year.
 
Net earnings in the second quarter, including discontinued operations, also were $0.16 per share, or $4.3 million. This compares to a net loss of $0.07 per share, or $1.9 million, in the prior-year period related to the sale of Harmon AutoGlass.
 
Commentary
 
"We are pleased that our second quarter results met internal expectations," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our architectural segment again turned in a solid performance in soft commercial construction markets. The large-scale optical segment is benefiting from the consolidation of its two businesses into one as it enters the traditionally strongest part of its year.
 
"I am very encouraged by our success at executing initiatives to increase architectural market share and to improve performance in this segment, along with some market strengthening," said Huffer. "With this momentum, we committed to the following key strategy in our growth plan.
 
"We are investing approximately $12 million to expand our architectural glass fabrication capacity by approximately $20 million in annual revenue. This new capacity will be available to serve growth in our core, higher-end markets resulting from our initiatives and the market exit of an architectural glass fabricator. We've been focused on growing sales of our value-added glass, including energy-efficient, hurricane and blast products, to the office, health care, education and institutional markets. We will also leverage this core market capacity to serve a portion of the broader market for smaller, less complex projects within 500 miles of our two facilities.
 
"We will be breaking ground for the expansion in our third quarter and expect to begin full operations on the additional line at our Statesboro, Georgia, Viracon facility next summer during our fiscal 2006 second quarter," he said.

OUTLOOK
 
"Based on achieving another solid quarter for our architectural segment and the flat glass settlement of $0.05 per share in the period, we are increasing our fiscal 2005 guidance range to $0.45 to $0.55 per share," said Huffer. The previous range was $0.35 to $0.50 per share.
 
"Achieving this guidance is contingent on a continuation of current architectural market trends and project flow timing, with no significant external events," he said.
 
"We expect that our architectural segment will continue to do better than the commercial construction industry this year," Huffer said. "We are anticipating architectural segment revenue growth of 14 to 17 percent for the fiscal year with continued pressure on margins. This is an increase from our previous outlook of 8 to 11 percent growth. We are gaining architectural market share with the success of our initiatives, including growth in our installation business and penetration of protective and hurricane markets.
 
"It is also encouraging that our commercial construction markets are expected to grow next year, based on forecasts from F.W. Dodge," he said. "Dodge anticipates overall non-residential construction market growth of 4 percent and office building growth of 10 percent." These forecasts for calendar 2004 correlate to Apogee's fiscal 2006 due to the average nine-month lag between project starts and the installation of glass on buildings.
 
"The large-scale optical segment expects to grow value-added glass sales more than 20 percent in fiscal 2005," Huffer said. "However, we anticipate revenues for the segment will be flat to down slightly for the full year as we continue to transition from matboard and some consumer electronics products to picture framing glass and acrylic. As the segment continues to sell a greater proportion of value-added framing glass, rather than other lower-margin products, we expect our profitability will continue to improve.
 
"We expect to continue to generate positive operating cash flow that will allow us to pay our dividend, reduce debt and fund capital spending, including current growth initiatives," said Huffer. "We do not anticipate making further stock repurchases during this fiscal year as we evaluate additional strategic opportunities.
 
"We have repositioned Apogee for a stronger future through our strategies for growing our architectural products and services, and picture framing glazing businesses," he said. "I'm pleased with our progress to date. We are gaining architectural market share and have decided to expand our capacity. Our architectural products and services businesses are making significant operational improvements, both through our Six Sigma/Lean effort and by leveraging synergies. These efforts are starting to yield improved margins. We will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to leverage assets and grow these businesses.
 
"Our large-scale optical segment has seen 20 percent growth year to date in value-added picture framing products. We've been partnering with mass merchandisers and distributors to deliver more affordable products to convert consumers from clear glass to value-added products. At the same time, we are focused on growing sales in museum, fine art and international markets. We also expect growth from our recently expanded line of acrylic framing products, which allows us to offer a total glazing solution."

NEW RELEASE
 
 
 
For Immediate Release
 
Monday, October 11, 2004
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (October 11, 2004)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced election of a new director and resignation of an existing director. Apogee's board of directors has nine members.
 
Mark A. Burke, 56, has been elected to the Apogee board of directors and will serve on its finance committee. Burke is the former president and chief executive officer of Vitro America, Inc., Memphis, TN. Vitro America, with annual revenues of approximately $500 million, is a leading glass fabricator, distributor and installer for the construction, automotive replacement and furniture industries. It is a subsidiary of Vitro, S.A. de C.V., Monterrey, Mexico, which has annual revenues of more than $2 billion.
 
"Mark brings 16 years glass industry expertise to Apogee's board, which will be an asset as we continue to implement strategies to grow our architectural segment businesses," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "His experience in successful strategic planning for diverse glass businesses will be instrumental as we capitalize on current high-potential architectural glass products and services and value-added picture framing glass products and markets, while adding complementary services demanded by our customers."
 
Burke was recruited in 1988 by the original owners of what is now Vitro America, and as president and chief executive officer turned a fragmented collection of acquisitions into a profitable company that was acquired by Vitro in 1992. Prior to joining the glass industry, he was president of Samsonite Furniture Company in Murfreesboro, TN from 1987 to 1988. From 1978 to 1987, he managed a variety of companies in industries ranging from consumer to industrial products for Allegheny International, based in Pittsburgh.
 
Robert L. Edwards, executive vice president and chief financial officer, Safeway Inc., has resigned from the Apogee board of directors. "We have valued Robert's contributions to our board and are disappointed that the demands of his position at Safeway don't allow him to continue as an Apogee director," said Huffer.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (), headquartered in Minneapolis, is a world leader in technologies involving the design and development of value-added glass products, services and systems. The company is organized in three segments: architectural products and services companies design, engineer, fabricate, install, maintain and renovate the walls of glass and windows comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings; large-scale optical technologies segment consists of a developer and producer of high technology glass and acrylic that enhances the visual performance of products for the picture framing, display and imaging industries; and automotive replacement glass and services segment consists of a fabricator of aftermarket foreign and domestic car windshields.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN (November 8, 2004)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOG), which develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries, today announced that its Harmon, Inc. subsidiary has entered into a definitive agreement to purchase the assets of Architectural Wall Solutions, Inc.

This transaction is part of Apogee's strategy to strengthen and grow its architectural businesses.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of December, subject to customary conditions. Terms were not disclosed.
 
"This acquisition is another building block in our strategy to improve and grow our high-potential architectural products and services businesses," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "The purchase of AWallS will bring a strong organization that
augments the strengths within Harmon. We will fill some critical organization needs with key AWallS executives who will assist with our ongoing efforts to improve the predictability and profitability of Harmon and our growth strategies. In addition, we expect to gain glass installation market share as we add to our presence in the Midwest and enter the Northwest region."
 
"This acquisition will further strengthen our management team, enhance our operational best practices and enable us to grow our business," said Chuck Mowrey, president of Harmon, Inc. "It clearly demonstrates the value Apogee places on Harmon and reflects a continued commitment to our company, our people and our customers."
 
"Combining our AWallS business with Harmon will allow us to offer our customers expanded services and resources," said AWallS executives Dennis Pilkinton and Tom Niepokoj. "And, our employees, who are a strength of AWallS, will have greater opportunities for growth with a larger industry leader."

Wednesday, December 15, 2004
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 15, 2004)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG), today announced fiscal 2005 third quarter earnings. Apogee develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.

Commentary
 
"We are pleased that third quarter results met our internal expectations," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our architectural segment again turned in a solid performance in a more stable commercial construction market. The large-scale optical segment continues to benefit from its success in converting the picture framing market to value-added glass.
 
"During the quarter, we made significant progress on our initiatives to increase architectural market share and to improve performance in this segment," said Huffer. "We broke ground on our architectural glass capacity expansion to serve growth in our core, higher-end markets, where we are also gaining share through our initiatives. The project is on schedule for a fiscal 2006 second quarter startup. We are investing approximately $12 million to expand our architectural glass fabrication capacity by approximately $20 million in annual revenues.
 
"The acquisition of commercial glass installer AWallS, announced during the third quarter and completed December 10, will strengthen the organization of our installation business, as well as help us increase market penetration in the Midwest and Northwest," he said. "We currently anticipate that the acquisition will add approximately $25 million in annual revenues."

OUTLOOK
 
"Based on achieving another solid quarter for our architectural segment, we are increasing our fiscal 2005 guidance range to $0.53 to $0.58 per share," said Huffer. The previous range was $0.45 to $0.55 per share.
 
"We expect that our architectural segment will continue to outperform the commercial construction industry for the remainder of our fiscal year," Huffer said. "We are anticipating architectural segment revenue growth of 18 to 20 percent for fiscal 2005, with full-year margins consistent with the year to date. This is an increase from our previous outlook of 14 to 17 percent growth. We are gaining architectural market share with the success of our initiatives  our architectural glass and installation businesses are growing, including in the protective and hurricane markets.
 
"The large-scale optical segment continues to grow value-added glass sales more than 20 percent," he said. "Our profitability is improving, even though we anticipate revenues for the segment will be down slightly for the full year as we continue to transition from lower-margin matboard and some consumer electronics products to picture framing glass and acrylic.
 
"We expect to continue to generate positive operating cash flow that will allow us to pay our dividend, reduce debt and fund capital spending, including current growth initiatives," said Huffer. "We do not anticipate making further stock repurchases during this fiscal year.
 
 
"Looking ahead to fiscal 2006, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10 percent," said Huffer. "We anticipate continued growth in our architectural segment revenues, modest growth in our large-scale optical segment and an ongoing decline in auto glass segment sales.
 
"Our outlook for architectural segment revenues reflects the market growth projected by F.W. Dodge and share growth, including from our recent glass installation acquisition, second half production from our new glass fabrication capacity and continued success with our initiatives. When taking into account the approximately $15 million in architectural revenues that moved into the first quarter of fiscal 2005 from the prior year, our overall growth outlook for fiscal 2006 is even greater than 10 percent," he said.
 
"We are anticipating earnings growth of 20 percent next year," Huffer said. "Excluding one-time items that benefited us in fiscal 2005, our earnings growth is expected to be approximately 40 percent next year. (The one-time items were a tax benefit of $0.04 per share in the first quarter and $0.05 per share from proceeds of a class action lawsuit settlement with flat glass manufacturers in the second quarter.)
 
"Our commercial construction markets are expected to grow next year after several down years, based on the most recent forecasts from Dodge for calendar 2004," he said. "Dodge anticipates overall non-residential construction market growth of 5 percent and office building growth of 11 percent." Dodge's forecasts for calendar 2004 correlate to Apogee's fiscal 2006 due to the average nine-month lag between project starts and the installation of glass on buildings.
 
"We feel that Apogee is on track to achieve its strategic growth objective of replacing revenues lost with the sale of Harmon AutoGlass by the end of fiscal 2007, and at a higher level of profitability," said Huffer.
 
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2005. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. ("Apogee") has had in place severance agreements with its executive officers since 1999 (the "Old Severance Agreements"). The Old Severance Agreements have been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and described in Apogee's proxy statements relating to its annual shareholder meetings. In accordance with the terms of the Old Severance Agreements, Apogee provided notice to its executive officers to terminate the Old Severance Agreements in August 2004. In October, 2004, Apogee's Compensation Committee approved new severance agreements for Apogee's executive officers (the "New Severance Agreements"), which contain terms that are more consistent with the terms of severance agreements in today's market but which overall are not substantially different from the terms of the Old Severance Agreements.
 
On January 5, 2005, the following executive officers executed the New Severance Agreements, which were effective as of January 1, 2005:
 
 
Like the Old Severance Agreements, the New Severance Agreements are designed to retain the executive officers and provide for continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of Apogee (as "change in control" is defined in the New Severance Agreements). The New Severance Agreements provide that, in the event of a change in control of Apogee, each executive officer would have specific rights and receive specified benefits if the executive officer is terminated without cause or the executive officer voluntarily terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined in the New Severance Agreements) within two years after the change in control. In these circumstances, Messrs. Huffer, Clauer, Marchido and Porter and Ms. Beithon will each receive a severance payment equal to two times the executive officer's annual salary plus the executive's targeted annual bonus (as calculated under the terms of the New Severance Agreements), and Mr. Johnson will receive a severance payment equal to his annual salary plus his targeted annual bonus (as calculated under the terms of the New Severance Agreements). Options granted under Apogee's Amended and Restated 1987 Stock Option Plan, 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, 2002 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan and agreements relating to Apogee's match under Apogee's Amended and Restated 1987 Partnership Plan also provide for payment or immediate vesting of awards in the event of a change in control of Apogee.
 
The forms of the New Severance Agreements are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and are incorporated herein by reference.

Benefits upon Termination under Section 2(b)(iii)
 
(a)
After a Change in Control.
 
(i) Upon the termination (voluntary or involuntary) of the employment of Executive pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii) hereof, Executive shall be entitled to receive the benefits specified in this Section 4. The amounts due to Executive under subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4(a) shall be paid to Executive not later than one business day prior to the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective (the "Employment Termination Date"). All benefits to Executive pursuant to this Section 4(a) shall be subject to any applicable income, payroll or other taxes required by law to be withheld.
 
(ii) The Company shall pay to Executive (A) the full base salary earned by him and unpaid through the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective, at the rate in effect at the time written notice of termination (voluntary or involuntary) was given, (B) any amount earned by Executive as a bonus with respect to the fiscal year of the Company preceding the termination of his employment if such bonus has not theretofore been paid to Executive, and (C) an amount representing credit for any vacation earned or accrued by him but not taken;
 
(iii) In lieu of any further base salary payments to Executive for periods subsequent to the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective, the Company shall pay as severance pay to Executive (a "Severance Payment") a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of:
 
 
(iv) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Amended and Restated 1987 Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan, as amended (the "Partnership Plan") (or in any other agreement or plan in existence between the Company and Executive at the Employment Termination Date), any rights Executive may have at any time under the Partnership Plan and which are deferred at the time of the Employment Termination Date shall immediately become vested and the Company shall pay to Executive any amounts due or which have been promised under the Partnership Plan to Executive;
 
(v) The Company shall also pay to Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive as a result of such termination of employment (including all fees and expenses, if any, incurred by Executive in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided to Executive by this Agreement whether by arbitration or otherwise);
 
(vi) Notwithstanding any other agreement in existence between the Company and Executive at the Employment Termination Date, all stock options or shares of restricted stock owned or held by Executive or promised to be payable to Executive by the Company shall be immediately vested in Executive without further restriction and Executive shall be treated at that time as the unrestricted owner of such Company stock options and stock, subject to applicable constraints under federal and state securities laws; and
 
(vii) Any and all contracts, agreements or arrangements between the Company and/or any other Apogee Entity and Executive prohibiting or restricting Executive from owning, operating, participating in, or providing employment or consulting services to, any business or company competitive with the Company or such other Apogee Entity at any time or during any period after the Employment Termination Date, shall be deemed terminated and of no further force or effect as of the Employment Termination Date, to the extent, but only to the extent, such contracts, agreements or arrangements so prohibit or restrict Executive; provided that, the foregoing provision shall not constitute a license or right to use any proprietary information of the Company or such other Apogee Entity and shall in no way affect any such contracts, agreements or arrangements insofar as they relate to nondisclosure and nonuse of proprietary information of the Company or such other Apogee Entity notwithstanding the fact that such nondisclosure and nonuse may prohibit or restrict Executive in certain competitive activities.
 
(b) Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise. The amount of any payment or benefit provided in this Section 4 shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as a result of any employment by another employer.
 
(c) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review, at the Company's sole expense, the applicability of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") to the "Total Payments" (as defined in Section 4(d) below) to be received by Executive. If such auditors determine that, after taking into account the provisions of Section 4(d) hereof, any of the Total Payments would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties with respect to such tax (such excise tax, together with interest and penalties, are collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then, in addition to any amounts payable under foregoing provisions of this Section 4, the Company shall pay an additional cash payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") within 30 days of such determination equal to the Excise Tax imposed on the Total Payments, including any Excise Tax or any other income taxes that may be imposed on such Gross-Up Payment. If no determination by the Company's auditors is made prior to the time a tax return reflecting the Total Payments is required to be filed by Executive, Executive will be entitled to receive a Gross-Up Payment calculated on the basis of the Total Payments reported by him in such tax return, within 30 days of the filing of such tax return. In all events, if any tax authority determines that a greater Excise Tax should be imposed on the Total Payments than is determined by the Company's independent auditors or reflected in Executive's tax return pursuant to this subparagraph (c), Executive shall be entitled to receive the full Gross-Up Payment calculated on the basis of the amount of Excise Tax determined to be payable by such tax authority from the Company within 30 days of such determination.
(d) As used herein, "Total Payments" shall mean, collectively, any payment or benefit received or to be received by Executive in connection with a Change in Control of the Company or termination of Executive's employment (whether payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, contract, agreement or arrangement with the Company, with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company or with any person constituting a member of an "affiliated group" as defined in Section 280G(d)(5) of the Code) with the Company or with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company. For purposes of calculating Total Payments, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which Executive shall have effectively waived in writing prior to the date of payment of the Severance Payment shall be taken into account; (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company and acceptable to Executive does not constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code; (iii) the value of any benefit provided by Section 4(a)(vi) of this Agreement shall not be taken into account in computing Total Payments; and (iv) the value of any other non-cash benefit or of any deferred cash payment included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. In case of uncertainty as to whether all or some portion of a payment is or is not payable to Executive under this Agreement, the Company shall initially make the payment to Executive, and Executive agrees to refund to the Company any amounts ultimately determined not to have been payable under the terms hereof.
 
5. .
Successors and Binding Agreement
 
(a) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company), by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be entitled hereunder if Executive terminated his employment after a Change in Control for Good Reason, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Employment Termination Date. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company and any successor to its business and/or assets which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 5(a) or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.
 
(b) This Agreement is personal to Executive, and Executive may not assign or transfer any part of his rights or duties hereunder, or any compensation due to him hereunder, to any other person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
 
6. . Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that Executive engages counsel to arbitrate any dispute hereunder (which arbitration results in an award to Executive of any kind) or to enforce such an award, all costs and expenses incurred by Executive, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, with respect to such arbitration or enforcement thereof shall be reimbursed to Executive by the Company promptly upon Executive's submission of a request therefor.
Arbitration
 
7. . No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed by Executive and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board of Directors of the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.
Modification; Waiver
8. . All notices, requests, demands and all other communications required or permitted by either party to the other party by this Agreement (including, without limitation, any notice of termination of employment and any notice of an intention to arbitrate) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally or received by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, at the address of the other party, as first written above (directed to the attention of the Board of Directors and Corporate Secretary in the case of the Company). Either party hereto may change its address for purposes of this Section 8 by giving 15 days' prior notice to the other party hereto.
Notice
 
9. . If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application hereof to any person or circumstances shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Severability
 
10. . This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
 
11. . This Agreement has been executed and delivered in the State of Minnesota and shall in all respects be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota, including all matters of construction, validity and performance.
Governing Law
 
12. . The Company and Executive understand and agree that this Agreement is intended to reflect their agreement only with respect to payments and benefits upon termination in certain cases and is not intended to create any obligation on the part of either party to continue employment. This Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements or policies made relating to the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof; provided that this Agreement shall not supersede or limit in any way Executive's rights under any benefit plan, program or arrangements in accordance with their terms.

The amounts due to Executive under subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4(a) shall be paid to Executive not later than one business day prior to the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective (the "Employment Termination Date"). All benefits to Executive pursuant to this Section 4(a) shall be subject to any applicable income, payroll or other taxes required by law to be withheld.
 
(ii) The Company shall pay to Executive (A) the full base salary earned by him and unpaid through the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective, at the rate in effect at the time written notice of termination (voluntary or involuntary) was given, (B) any amount earned by Executive as a bonus with respect to the fiscal year of the Company preceding the termination of his employment if such bonus has not theretofore been paid to Executive, and (C) an amount representing credit for any vacation earned or accrued by him but not taken.
 
(iii) In lieu of any further base salary payments to Executive for periods subsequent to the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective, the Company shall pay as severance pay to Executive (a "Severance Payment") a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of:
 
 
 
(iv) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Amended and Restated 1987 Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan, as amended (the "Partnership Plan") (or in any other agreement or plan in existence between the Company and Executive at the Employment Termination Date), any rights Executive may have at any time under the Partnership Plan and which are deferred at the time of the Employment Termination Date shall immediately become vested and the Company shall pay to Executive any amounts due or which have been promised under the Partnership Plan to Executive;
(v) The Company shall also pay to Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive as a result of such termination of employment (including all fees and expenses, if any, incurred by Executive in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided to Executive by this Agreement whether by arbitration or otherwise);
 
(vi) Notwithstanding any other agreement in existence between the Company and Executive at the Employment Termination Date, all stock options or shares of restricted stock owned or held by Executive or promised to be payable to Executive by the Company shall be immediately vested in Executive without further restriction and Executive shall be treated at that time as the unrestricted owner of such Company stock options and stock, subject to applicable constraints under federal and state securities laws; and
 
(vii) Any and all contracts, agreements or arrangements between the Company and/or any other Apogee Entity and Executive prohibiting or restricting Executive from owning, operating, participating in, or providing employment or consulting services to, any business or company competitive with the Company or such other Apogee Entity at any time or during any period after the Employment Termination Date, shall be deemed terminated and of no further force or effect as of the Employment Termination Date, to the extent, but only to the extent, such contracts, agreements or arrangements so prohibit or restrict Executive; provided that, the foregoing provision shall not constitute a license or right to use any proprietary information of the Company or such other Apogee Entity and shall in no way affect any such contracts, agreements or arrangements insofar as they relate to nondisclosure and nonuse of proprietary information of the Company or such other Apogee Entity notwithstanding the fact that such nondisclosure and nonuse may prohibit or restrict Executive in certain competitive activities.
 
(b) Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise. The amount of any payment or benefit provided in this Section 4 shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as a result of any employment by another employer.
 
(c) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review, at the Company's sole expense, the applicability of Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") to the "Total Payments" (as defined in Section 4(d) below) to be received by Executive. If such auditors determine that, after taking into account the provisions of Section 4(d) hereof, any of the Total Payments would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties with respect to such tax (such excise tax, together with interest and penalties, are collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then, in addition to any amounts payable under foregoing provisions of this Section 4, the Company shall pay an additional cash payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") within 30 days of such determination equal to the Excise Tax imposed on the Total Payments, including any Excise Tax or any other income taxes that may be imposed on such Gross-Up Payment. If no determination by the Company's auditors is made prior to the time a tax return reflecting the Total Payments is required to be filed by Executive, Executive will be entitled to receive a Gross-Up Payment calculated on the basis of the Total Payments reported by him in such tax return, within 30 days of the filing of such tax return. In all events, if any tax authority determines that a greater Excise Tax should be imposed on the Total Payments than is determined by the Company's independent auditors or reflected in Executive's tax return pursuant to this subparagraph (c), Executive shall be entitled to receive the full Gross-Up Payment calculated on the basis of the amount of Excise Tax determined to be payable by such tax authority from the Company within 30 days of such determination.
 
(d) As used herein, "Total Payments" shall mean, collectively, any payment or benefit received or to be received by Executive in connection with a Change in Control of the Company or termination of Executive's employment (whether payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, contract, agreement or arrangement with the Company, with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company or with any person constituting a member of an "affiliated group" as defined in Section 280G(d)(5) of the Code) with the Company or with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company. For purposes of calculating Total Payments, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which Executive shall have effectively waived in writing prior to the date of payment of the Severance Payment shall be taken into account;
(ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company and acceptable to Executive does not constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code; (iii) the value of any benefit provided by Section 4(a)(vi) of this Agreement shall not be taken into account in computing Total Payments; and (iv) the value of any other non-cash benefit or of any deferred cash payment included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. In case of uncertainty as to whether all or some portion of a payment is or is not payable to Executive under this Agreement, the Company shall initially make the payment to Executive, and Executive agrees to refund to the Company any amounts ultimately determined not to have been payable under the terms hereof.
 
5. .
Successors and Binding Agreement
 
(a) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company), by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be entitled hereunder if Executive terminated his employment after a Change in Control for Good Reason, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Employment Termination Date. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company and any successor to its business and/or assets which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 5(a) or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.
 
(b) This Agreement is personal to Executive, and Executive may not assign or transfer any part of his rights or duties hereunder, or any compensation due to him hereunder, to any other person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
 
6. . Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that Executive engages counsel to arbitrate any dispute hereunder (which arbitration results in an award to Executive of any kind) or to enforce such an award, all costs and expenses incurred by Executive, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, with respect to such arbitration or enforcement thereof shall be reimbursed to Executive by the Company promptly upon Executive's submission of a request therefor.
Arbitration
 
7. . No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed by Executive and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board of Directors of the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.
Modification; Waiver
 
8. . All notices, requests, demands and all other communications required or permitted by either party to the other party by this Agreement (including, without limitation, any notice of termination of employment and any notice of an intention to arbitrate) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally or received by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, at the address of the other party, as first written above (directed to the attention of the Board of Directors and Corporate Secretary in the case of the Company). Either party hereto may change its address for purposes of this Section 8 by giving 15 days' prior notice to the other party hereto.
Notice
9. . If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application hereof to any person or circumstances shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Severability
 
10. . This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
 
11. . This Agreement has been executed and delivered in the State of Minnesota and shall in all respects be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota, including all matters of construction, validity and performance.
Governing Law
 
12. . The Company and Executive understand and agree that this Agreement is intended to reflect their agreement only with respect to payments and benefits upon termination in certain cases and is not intended to create any obligation on the part of either party to continue employment. This Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements or policies made relating to the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof; provided that this Agreement shall not supersede or limit in any way Executive's rights under any benefit plan, program or arrangements in accordance with their terms.
Effect of Agreement; Entire Agreement
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed in its name by a duly authorized director and officer, and Executive has hereunto set his hand, all as of the date first written above.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN (April 6, 2005)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and full-year earnings. Apogee develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.

Commentary on FY05
 
"We are pleased that our fourth quarter and full year results exceeded our expectations as we successfully implemented our growth strategies, a focus that will continue in fiscal 2006," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "In the fourth quarter, our architectural segment turned in an especially strong revenue performance in a more stable, but still very competitive commercial construction market. The large-scale optical segment continues to benefit from its success in converting the picture framing market to value-added glass.
 
"During the quarter, we continued to make progress on our initiatives to increase architectural market share and to improve future performance in this segment," said Huffer. "Our architectural glass capacity expansion to serve growth in our core, higher-end markets is on schedule for a fiscal 2006 second quarter startup. In addition, we completed the acquisition of commercial glass installer AWallS, which is helping us strengthen our installation organization and increase market penetration in the Midwest and Northwest."

OUTLOOK FOR FY06
 
"Building on our strong performance in fiscal 2005, we are anticipating earnings growth approaching 20 percent in fiscal 2006, to $0.68 to $0.72 per share," Huffer said. "Excluding unusual items, our earnings growth is expected to be approximately 40 percent next year. (These items include $0.05 per share from proceeds of a class action lawsuit settlement with flat glass manufacturers in fiscal 2005 and an expected $0.04 per share impact in the second half of fiscal 2006 related to expensing stock options.)
 
"Our fiscal 2006 revenue expectations haven't changed from previous guidance, but because of our especially strong fourth quarter sales, our top-line growth target is now 6 to 8 percent," said Huffer. "We anticipate continued growth in our architectural segment revenues, modest growth in our large-scale optical segment and an ongoing decline in auto glass segment sales.
 
"Our longer-term goal is to achieve an average of 8 percent annual revenue growth and 20 percent annual earnings per share growth over the three-year period from fiscal 2006 to 2008," he said. "We expect continued improvement in architectural segment margins as we see market share growth in
 
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.
Page 4
 
more attractive segments of the market, including new office construction and building renovation. For our large-scale optical segment, we anticipate continued conversion to value-added products, although current high margins will likely be flat to slightly down, in part as a result of our strategy to drive conversion by making products more affordable at the consumer level.
 
"We expect fiscal 2006 architectural segment revenue growth of 6 to 9 percent, based on our solid first-half backlog and strong quote activity for second-half work yet to be secured. This growth rate reflects the market improvement projected by F.W. Dodge and share growth, including from our recent glass installation acquisition, second-half production from our new glass fabrication capacity and continued success with our initiatives. When taking into account the approximately $15 million in architectural revenues that moved into the first quarter of fiscal 2005 from the prior year, our overall growth outlook for fiscal 2006 is greater than 6 to 9 percent," he said. "To achieve the higher end of this range, we will need to see continued market improvement, including pricing.
 
"Our commercial construction markets are expected to grow this year after several down years, based on the most recent estimate from Dodge for calendar 2004," Huffer said. "Dodge anticipates overall non-residential construction market growth of 5 percent." Dodge's estimate for calendar 2004 correlates to Apogee's fiscal 2006 due to the average nine-month lag between project starts and the installation of glass on buildings.
 
"The large-scale optical segment is expected to continue to grow value-added glass sales more than 20 percent," he said. "We expect slight growth in overall segment revenues in fiscal 2006 as we continue to convert the market to value-added framing products, while consumer electronics revenues further decline.
 
"Although, our auto glass business faces difficult market conditions, we expect it to continue to generate cash for Apogee," Huffer said. "In fiscal 2006, with the expiration of our supply agreement with PPG Industries in the second quarter, we will be transitioning back to the independent distributor marketplace where we expect to fill a need for shorter lead-time aftermarket windshields which offer somewhat improved margins.
 
"We expect to continue to generate positive operating cash flow that will allow us to pay our dividend, reduce debt and fund capital spending, including current growth initiatives," said Huffer.
 
"We are excited about our prospects for the current year, as our initiatives deliver results and our architectural markets strengthen," said Huffer.
 
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2006. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

The discussion above, including all statements in the Outlook section, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: Operational risks within (A) the Architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow; ii) economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully utilize production capacity; v) integration of the AWallS acquisition in a timely and cost-efficient manner; and vi) completion and production ramp-up of the Viracon capacity expansion in a timely and cost-efficient manner; (B) the Large-Scale Optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; and iii) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities; and (C) the Auto Glass segment: i) transition of markets served, as the long-term supply agreement with PPG Industries for auto replacement windshields expires in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and product is then marketed to independent distributors; ii) changes in market dynamics; iii) market seasonality; iv) highly competitive, fairly mature industry; and v) performance of the PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) the possibility of a material product liability event; iii) the costs of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; and v) foreign currency risk related to discontinued operations. The company cautions readers that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The company wishes to caution

investors that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2004.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Executive Short-Term Cash Bonus Plan Metrics
 
On April 13, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") determined that the following performance metrics will be used for determining annual incentives under the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Executive Short-Term Cash Bonus Plan for fiscal 2006: (1) revenue and earnings per share at the corporate level, (2) revenue and earnings before taxes at the segment level, and (3) revenue and earnings before taxes at the business unit level. For each of the performance metrics there is a threshold, target and maximum performance level, which will be initially determined by management, recommended to the Compensation Committee for its consideration and approved (as modified, in its discretion) by the Compensation Committee. If the threshold performance level is achieved, 50% of the target award will be paid to the executive, and if the maximum performance level is achieved, 150% of the target award will be paid to the executive. For all performance levels between these levels, awards will be linearly interpolated. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors selects executive officers and other senior executives from the Company and its subsidiaries to participate in this plan.
 
Bonus Award Agreement with Russell Huffer
 
On April 13, 2005, the Company entered into a Bonus Award Agreement with Mr. Russell Huffer, the Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Mr. Huffer may receive an annual bonus award under the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Executive Management Incentive Plan. The agreement provides that Mr. Huffer's right to receive an annual bonus award, payable in either cash or stock, will be determined based on the attainment of certain pre-set goals for fiscal 2006 relating to earnings per share and return on invested capital. In the event Mr. Huffer's employment is terminated during a Performance Period (as defined in the agreement) for any reason other than Disability (as defined in the agreement), Retirement (as defined in the agreement) or death, the agreement provides that Mr. Huffer will forfeit any and all rights under the agreement relating to such Performance Period and any other award granted under the agreement with respect to which any other Performance Period has not yet commenced. In accordance with the agreement, if Mr. Huffer's employment with the Company is terminated during the Performance Period as a result of Disability, Retirement or death, Mr. Huffer, or Mr. Huffer's estate, as applicable, will receive a pro-rata cash payment after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance goals is achieved. The Bonus Award Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and Performance Share Grants
 
On April 13, 2005, the Company awarded stock appreciation rights and performance shares to its executive officers. Information regarding the terms of the awards is set forth below.
 
SAR Grants
 
The Company awarded stock-settled SARs to the following executive officers in the amounts indicated:
 
 
Such SAR awards were made pursuant to the shareholder approved Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2002 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Stock Plan"), a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as
 
Exhibit A to the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2002 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The form of Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement used in connection with SAR awards to employees under the 2002 Stock Plan, including the awards to the executives listed above, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference (the "Form of Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement").
 
The SARs vest evenly over a three-year period and have a ten-year term. The SARs become immediately exercisable in full upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement). The SARs may not be transferred by the executive except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the SARs may only be exercised during the executive's lifetime. The SAR shall terminate and may no longer be exercised if the executive ceases to be employed by the Company, except that:
 
 
 
 
 
Upon exercise of an SAR, the executive will receive the number of shares of the Company's common stock that has a total value which is equivalent to the difference between the grant price of the SAR and the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of exercise. If, at any time prior to the full exercise of a SAR, the executive engages in any Forfeiture Activity (as defined in the agreement), then the SAR will immediately terminate and all unexercised rights to receive shares of the Company's common stock (whether exercisable or not) will be immediately forfeited. In addition, if the executive engages in any Forfeiture Activity within one year after exercising all or part of a SAR, then (1) all shares of common stock received by the executive as a result of all exercises of the SAR made within such 12-month period, plus any period subsequent to the date of such Forfeiture Activity and prior to the Company's delivery of a demand notice to the executive (collectively, the "Forfeiture Period") and (2) all consideration received by the executive pursuant to the transfer of any such shares made by the executive during the Forfeiture Period, must be delivered or paid to the Company within 30 days of a written demand by the Company.
 
Performance Shares
 
The Company awarded to the following executive officers (i) the number of shares of common stock of the Company equal to the below number of performance shares at target (the "Issued Shares") and (ii) the right to receive an amount of additional shares of common stock equal to the difference between the maximum number of performance shares and the target number of performance shares (the "Additional Shares" and, together with the Issued Shares, the "Performance Shares").
 
 
Such Performance Share awards were made pursuant to the 2002 Stock Plan. The form of Performance Share Agreement used in connection with performance share awards under the 2002 Stock Plan, including the awards to the executives listed above, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated herein by reference (the "Form of Performance Share Agreement").
 
The Issued Shares are subject to forfeiture and certain other restrictions set forth in the Form of Performance Share Agreement during the period commencing on February 27, 2005 and ending on March 1, 2008 (the "Performance Period"). The number of Issued Shares that may be retained and the number of Additional Shares, if any, that may be issued for each executive is dependant upon the Company's Average Return on Invested Capital, Cumulative Earnings Per Share, and Market Share Growth at the end of the Performance Period in comparison to certain preset targets. The threshold, target and maximum amounts of Performance Shares that may be earned by the executives are set forth in the above table. Upon vesting, the restrictions on the Issued Shares lapse and the shares become transferable and non-forfeitable. All Issued Shares not deemed to have been earned and vested at the end of the Performance Period will be forfeited and transferred back to the Company. In the event the executive's employment is terminated during the Performance Period, the Performance Shares shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited, unless the executive's termination is by reason of:
 
 
 
 
 
In the event the executive's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of involuntary termination without Cause, the executive shall be entitled to retain, and receive, if applicable, a pro-rata portion (based on the amount of time elapsed between the beginning of the Performance Period and the date of termination) of the Performance Shares after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the Performance Goals is achieved. In the event the executive's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of Early Retirement, Retirement, Disability or death, the executive or the executive's estate, as applicable, shall be entitled to retain, and receive, if applicable, the Performance Shares after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the Performance Goals is achieved. In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the
 
agreement) prior to the end of the Performance Period, the executive shall be entitled to retain a pro-rata portion of the Issued Shares based on the amount of time elapsed between the beginning of the Performance Period and the date of the Change in Control.
 
The descriptions in this Current Report on Form 8-K of the Bonus Award Agreement, Form of Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement and Form of Performance Share Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the attached forms of such agreements.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On May 4, 2005, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a credit agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of May 4, 2005, among the Company, each of the lenders from time to time parties to the Agreement, and The Bank of New York, as letter of credit issuer, administrative agent for the Lenders and swing line lender. The Agreement creates a new, five-year, committed, unsecured, revolving credit facility in the amount of $100.0 million (subject to increase under the Agreement to an amount not exceeding $175.0 million). The credit facility includes a letter of credit facility in the amount of up to $25 million, the outstanding amounts of which decrease the available borrowing base. The Agreement replaced the Company's previously existing $125.0 million unsecured, revolving credit facility, which was terminated upon closing of the Agreement on May 4, 2005.
 
The Company may elect the borrowings under the Agreement to bear interest at one of two rates. First, borrowings under the Agreement may be made at an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin (which is calculated based upon the Company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio) and LIBOR (as defined in the Agreement). Second, borrowings under the Agreement may be made at an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of: (1) the Alternate Base Rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) the interest rate announced by the administrative agent in The City of New York as its prime commercial loan rate in effect on such day and (y) the sum of 0.50% per annum and the federal funds rate in effect on such day) in effect from time to time, and (2) the Applicable Margin.
 
The Agreement requires the Company to maintain minimum levels of net worth and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of not more than 2.75. If the Company is not in compliance with either of these requirements, the lender may terminate the commitment and/or declare any loan then outstanding to be due.
 
The Agreement provides that the Company may not be a party to any merger, consolidation or share exchange, or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any substantial part ( 10% or more (excluding Like-Kind Exchanges (as defined in the Agreement)) of the total consolidated assets of the Company per fiscal year over all transactions during that year) of its assets or property, or in any event sell or discount any of its notes or accounts receivable, or permit any subsidiary to do so; , , that, the foregoing restriction does not apply to or operate to prevent (1) the Company being a party to any merger where the Company is the surviving person if, after giving effect to such merger, no Default or Event of Default (both as defined in the Agreement) would then exist, (2) any subsidiary merging into the Company or being a party to any merger which does not involve the Company where a subsidiary is the surviving person if, after giving effect to such merger, no Default or Event of Default would then exist, (3) the Company or any subsidiary from selling its inventory in the ordinary course of its business, (4) any dissolution of an inactive subsidiary that would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Agreement), if, after giving effect to such dissolution, no Default or Event of Default would then exist, and (5) any Like-Kind Exchange.
i.e.
provided
however
 
The Agreement further provides that the Company may not declare any dividends (other than dividends payable in capital stock of the Company) on any shares of any class of its capital stock, or set apart any sum for the payment of any dividends on, or make any other distribution by reduction of capital or otherwise in respect of, any shares of any class of capital stock of the Company, unless, immediately after giving effect to such action, there shall not have occurred any Default or Event of Default that is continuing.
 
Amounts due under the Agreement may be accelerated upon an Event of Default, such as a breach of a representation or covenant or the occurrence of bankruptcy, if not otherwise waived or cured.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
The Company's previously existing Credit Agreement, dated as of April 25, 2002, among the Company, each of the lenders from time to time parties to the agreement, and The Bank of New York, as letter of credit issuer, administrative agent for the lenders and swing line lender (the "Prior Agreement"), created a four-year, committed, unsecured, revolving credit facility in the amount of $125 million. The Prior Agreement required the Company to maintain levels of net worth and certain financial ratios. These ratios included maintaining an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by interest expense) of more than 3.0 and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 3.0, 2.75 or 2.5, depending on the time period. If the Company was not in compliance with these ratios at the end of any quarter (with respect to interest coverage) or at the end of any day (with respect to debt-to-EBITDA ratio), the lender had the right to terminate the commitment and/or declare any loan then outstanding to be due. The Prior Agreement, which would have expired in accordance with its terms on April 25, 2006, was terminated upon the closing of the Agreement on May 4, 2005.
 
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
 
The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 8.01 Other Events.

The Borrower may request that the L/C Issuer issue a Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.06(a) by giving a L/C Request to the Administrative Agent in writing not later than 11:00 A.M., New York time, on the fifth Business Day prior to the proposed date of issuance of the Letter of Credit. Upon receipt of any L/C Request, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice to each Lender of the substance thereof. On the date specified by the Borrower in such notice and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in this Section 2.06 and Article VI or the waiver thereof by Lenders, the L/C Issuer will issue such Letter of Credit in the form specified in such L/C Request.
Procedure for Obtaining Letter of Credit
 
(c) . Immediately upon the issuance of a Letter of Credit, each Lender other than the L/C Issuer shall be deemed to, and hereby agrees to, have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased from the L/C Issuer a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the maximum amount which is or at any time may become available to be drawn thereunder.
Participation by Lenders
 
(d) . (i) In the event of any request for a drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent as promptly as practicable following receipt of such request, and the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer on or prior to the third Business Day after the day on which such drawing is honored in an amount of immediately available funds equal to the amount of such drawing.
Drawings and Reimbursement
 
(ii) If the Borrower shall fail to immediately reimburse the L/C Issuer in an amount equal to the amount of any drawing honored by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit, then the L/C Issuer shall promptly notify each Lender of the unreimbursed amount of such drawing and of such Lender's respective participation therein. Not later than 2:00 P.M., New York time, on the Business Day after the date notified by the L/C
 
Issuer or if the Lenders are notified by the L/C Issuer prior to 11:00 A.M., New York time, on the date so notified, each Lender shall make available to the L/C Issuer in immediately available funds at the office of the L/C Issuer in The City of New York an amount equal to its respective participation. For so long as any Lender fails so to fund its participation in any such Letter of Credit, the amount of such participation shall be deemed, for purposes of determining the Required Lenders, to be subtracted from such Lender's L/C Obligations and added to the L/C Issuer's L/C Obligations. If any Lender fails to make available to the L/C Issuer on such Business Day the amount of such Lender's participation in such Letter of Credit as provided in this Section 2.06(d), then the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to (A) from (and including) such Business Day to (and including) the third Business Day thereafter, the Federal Funds Rate, and (B) from (but excluding) such third Business Day, the sum of 2% and the Federal Funds Rate. The L/C Issuer shall distribute to each Lender that has paid all amounts payable by it under this Section 2.06 with respect to any Letter of Credit such Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments received by the L/C Issuer from the Borrower in reimbursement of drawings honored by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit when such payments are received.
 
(iii) The obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for drawings made under the Letters of Credit and the obligations of the Lenders under Section 2.06(d)(ii) shall be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Credit Documents under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:
 
(A) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit;
 
(B) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right which the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or transferee may be acting), the L/C Issuer, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with any Credit Document, any transaction contemplated thereby or any unrelated transaction;
 
(C) any draft, demand, certificate or any other document presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;
 
(D) payment by the L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document that does not comply with the terms of the Credit Documents;
 
(E) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, which is similar to any of the foregoing; or
 
(F) the fact that a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred.
 
(e) . If a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the L/C Issuer may require the deposit of funds in an interest-bearing account as
Security Deposit
 
agreed to between the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Borrower to secure payment to the beneficiary of any outstanding Letter of Credit. Any funds so deposited shall be paid to the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit if all conditions to such payment are satisfied, or returned to the L/C Issuer for distribution to the Lenders (or, if all obligations under this Agreement shall have been indefeasibly paid in full, to the Borrower) if no payment to the beneficiary has been made and the final date available for drawings under such Letter of Credit has passed. Each payment or deposit of funds by the L/C Issuer as provided in this paragraph shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as a drawing duly honored by the L/C Issuer under the related Letter of Credit.
 
(f) . The Borrower may request that the L/C Issuer allow, and the L/C Issuer may (in its sole discretion) agree to allow, one or more Letters of Credit issued by it to expire later than the date that is four Business Days prior to the Commitment Termination Date. Any such Letter of Credit is referred to herein as an "." The following provisions shall apply to any Extended Letter of Credit, notwithstanding any contrary provision set forth herein.
Extended Letters of Credit

Each such deposit shall be held by the L/C Issuer as collateral for the obligations of the Borrower in respect of such Extended Letters of Credit. The L/C Issuer shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the L/C Issuer and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the L/C Issuer to reimburse disbursements in respect of such Extended Letters of Credit for which the L/C Issuer has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the aggregate L/C Obligations at such time in respect of the Extended Letters of Credit.
 
(iii) After the close of business on the date that is four Business Days prior to the Commitment Termination Date, all fees that would have accrued (if the participations of the Lenders in the Extended Letters of Credit had not terminated) shall continue to accrue on the L/C Obligations in respect of each Extended Letter of Credit and shall be payable to the L/C Issuer for its own account.
 
Section 2.07 . (a) The Borrower may, at any time after the Effective Date and before the Commitment Termination Date, propose that the $100,000,000 Total Commitment as of the Effective Date be increased to an amount not greater than $175,000,000 by notice to the Administrative Agent, that
Total Commitment Increase
provided
 
(i) such notice shall specify the existing Lenders who are willing to provide an additional Commitment and/or specify any new financial institutions (to be agreed to by the Administrative Agent, which agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld) willing to become Lenders under this Agreement and shall specify the date on which such increase is to be effective (which shall be a Business Day at least 5 Business Days after delivery of such notice and prior to the Commitment Termination Date),
 
(ii) no existing Lender party to this Agreement at the time of the request for an increase in the Total Commitment shall be required (or have any other obligation) to increase its Commitment to satisfy the proposed increase (although any Lender may opt to do so in its own discretion);
 
(iii) a Total Commitment increase must be a minimum aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or in integral multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof (not to exceed a Total Commitment of $175,000,000);
 
(iv) the Borrower may not request a Total Commitment increase more than three (3) times between the Effective Date and the Commitment Termination Date; and
 
(v) such notice shall be accompanied by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower certifying that the amount to which the Total Commitment will be increased does not exceed the limits established by the Board of Directors of the Borrower for this Agreement.
 
(b) A new lender may become party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.07(a) by executing a New Lender Supplement with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in substantially the form of (a ""), whereupon such lender shall become a Lender for all purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party to this Agreement. Effective as of the date on which any such new lender becomes a Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.07, the Total Commitment shall be increased by the amount of such new Lender's Commitment.
Exhibit G-1
New Lender Supplement
 
(c) An existing Lender may increase its Commitment under this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.07(a) by executing a Commitment Increase Supplement, in substantially the form of (a ""), whereupon such Lender shall be bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement with respect to the full amount of its Commitment as so increased. Effective as of the date on which any such Lender so increases its Commitment, the Total Commitment shall be increased by the amount of such Lender's additional Commitment.
Exhibit G-2
Commitment Increase Supplement
 
(d) If on the effective date of any New Lender Supplement there is outstanding an unpaid principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans, then the Borrower shall borrow Revolving Credit Loans from such new Lender in an amount determined by multiplying the amount of such new Lender's Commitment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and the denominator of which shall be the Total Commitment giving effect to the new Lender's Commitment. If on the effective date of any Commitment Increase Supplement there is outstanding an unpaid principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans, then the Borrower shall borrow Revolving Credit Loans from such increasing Lender in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the outstanding amount of Revolving
 
Credit Loans from this Lender and (ii) the amount determined by multiplying the new increased Commitment of the Lender by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the then unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and the denominator of which shall be the Total Commitment giving effect to the increasing Lender's new Commitment. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if there are Eurodollar Loans outstanding, such new Lender or increasing Lender will make Loans (which shall constitute Eurodollar Loans for the purposes of this Agreement) to the Borrower in its Pro Rata Share (in the case of an existing Lender increasing its Commitment pursuant to Section 2.07(c), calculated based solely on the amount of the increase in its Commitment) having Interest Periods corresponding to the then unexpired portions of the respective Interest Periods of such Eurodollar Loans and bearing interest at a rate equal to such rate calculated pursuant to Section 3.03. The Borrower shall then prepay existing Revolving Credit Loans down in an amount in aggregate equal to the amount borrowed from the new Lenders and/or increasing Lenders so that, after giving effect to the transactions described in this Section 2.07, the Revolving Credit Loans are held ratably by the Lenders in accordance with the respective Commitments of the Lenders. Any prepayment shall be accompanied by the payment of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the amounts required in Section 4.03.
 
(e) The Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of any addition of a new Lender or any increase in the Commitment of an existing Lender and of the amount of any borrowing from it hereunder made simultaneously upon such addition or increase.
 
(f) No Total Commitment increase shall be effective (notwithstanding the date in the notice described in Section 2.07(a)(i)) until the requirements of this Section have been satisfied, including the receipt by the Administrative Agent of the documents referred to in Sections 2.07(b) and/or 2.07(c), as applicable.
 
Section 2.08 . (a) An appropriate termination agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the ""), shall be executed and such Termination Agreement will, among other things, (i) terminate the Existing Credit Agreement, Existing Subsidiary Guaranty and Existing Contribution Agreement and (ii) require the repayment of all Loans and L/C Obligations under the Existing Facility, together with accrued interest and any fees due at the termination of the Commitments under the Existing Facility. The Administrative Agent under the Existing Facility acknowledges, on behalf of the parties to the Credit Documents under the Existing Facility, that Loans (as defined in this Agreement) drawn under this Agreement may be used simultaneously to repay obligations under the Existing Facility. The "" means the Credit Documents as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement, and the rights and obligations thereunder. Unless otherwise provided above, for purposes of this Section 2.08(a) only, the terms "Loans," "L/C Obligations," "Commitments," "Administrative Agent," and "Credit Documents," have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Existing Facility.

The Borrower represents that there are no unreimbursed obligations under the Outstanding L/Cs.

Upon receipt, the Administrative Agent forthwith shall give notice to each Lender of the substance of each Conversion Request. Upon payment by the Borrower of the amounts, if any, required by Section 4.03, on the Conversion Date the Revolving Credit Loans or portions thereof as to which the Conversion Request was made shall commence to accrue interest in the manner selected by the Borrower therein.

(a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest from the date made until the date repaid or converted to an ABR Loan, payable in arrears, and with respect to Interest Periods of three months or less, on the last day of such Interest Period, and with respect to Interest Periods longer than three months, on the day which is three months after the commencement of such Interest Period and on the last day of such Interest Period, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) the Applicable Margin, and (ii) LIBOR.
Interest on Eurodollar Loans
 
(b) Each Eurodollar Loan shall become an ABR Loan at the end of the Interest Period therefor unless (i) there shall not have occurred and be continuing a Default or Event of Default and (ii) not later than the third Business Day prior to the last day of such Interest Period, the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent (x) an irrevocable written election of the subsequent Interest Period therefor, in which case such Eurodollar Loan shall remain outstanding as a Eurodollar Loan, or (y) a Conversion Request with respect thereto, in which case such Eurodollar Loan shall be converted in accordance with Section 3.01(b).
 
(c) If, during any period, a Lender shall be required to maintain reserves against "eurocurrency liabilities" in accordance with Federal Reserve Board Regulation D, the Borrower shall pay additional interest during such period on each outstanding Eurodollar Loan of such Lender (contemporaneously with each interest payment due thereon commencing with the first such payment due at least two Business Days after receipt of the notice referred to in the next sentence) at a rate per annum up to but not exceeding the marginal rate determined by the following formula:
 
 
Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, upon becoming aware that the Borrower may be required to make a payment of additional interest to such Lender. When requesting payment pursuant to this Section 3.03(c), a Lender shall provide to the Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a certificate, signed by an officer of such Lender setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis of such claim, the amount required to be paid by the Borrower to such Lender and the computations made by such Lender to determine such amount. Absent manifest error, such certificate shall be binding as to the amounts of additional interest owing in respect of such Lender's Eurodollar Loans. Any Lender that gives notice under this Section 3.03(c) shall promptly withdraw such notice (by written notice of withdrawal given to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower) whenever such Lender is no longer required to maintain such reserves or the circumstances giving rise to such notice shall otherwise cease.
 
Section 3.04 . Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, all overdue amounts hereunder, and, during the continuance of any Event of Default that shall have occurred, each Loan, shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (i) 2.00% and (ii) the rate then applicable, changing as and when such rate shall change, until, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the end of the current Interest Period therefor, and thereafter the rate of interest applicable to ABR Loans.
Interest on Overdue Amounts
 
Section 3.05 . Interest on ABR Loans shall be calculated on the basis of (a) a 365-day, or, if applicable, a 366-day, year for the actual number of days elapsed for so long as interest is determined pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of "Alternate Base Rate" and (b) a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed otherwise.

Maximum Interest Rate
 
(b) If the amount of interest payable for the account of any Lender on any interest payment date in respect of the immediately preceding interest computation period, computed pursuant to this Article III, would exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law to be charged by such Lender, the amount of interest payable for its account on such interest payment date shall automatically be reduced to such maximum permissible amount.
 
(c) If the amount of interest payable for the account of any Lender in respect of any interest computation period is reduced pursuant to Section 3.06(b) and the amount of interest payable for its account in respect of any subsequent interest computation period would be less than the maximum amount permitted by law to be charged by such Lender, then the amount of interest payable for its account in respect of such subsequent interest computation period shall be automatically increased to such maximum permissible amount; that at no time shall the aggregate amount by which interest paid for the account of any Lender has been increased pursuant to this Section 3.06(c) exceed the aggregate amount by which interest paid for its account has theretofore been reduced pursuant to Section 3.06(b).

(b) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan to be made by it on the Borrowing Date therefor shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation to make its Loan or Loans on such date, but neither any Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan to be made by such other Lender.
 
(c) The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, advance on behalf of any Lender the amount of such Lender's Loans to be made on a Borrowing Date, unless such Lender shall have notified the Administrative Agent prior to such Borrowing Date that it does not intend to make such Loans on such date. If the Administrative Agent makes any such advance, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover the amount so advanced on demand from the Lender on whose behalf such advance was made and, if such Lender does not pay the Administrative Agent the amount of such advance on demand, the Borrower agrees promptly to repay such amount to the Administrative Agent. Until such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent by such Lender or the Borrower, such advance shall be deemed for all purposes to be a Loan made on such Borrowing Date by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on the amount advanced by it for each day from the Borrowing Date therefor until repaid to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate until the third Business Day after the date of the advance and, thereafter, at the rate per annum equal to the relevant rate on Loans made on the relevant Borrowing Date.

(c) Whenever any payment from the Borrower shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date of payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for such extended time.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN (May 4, 2005)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOG) announced that today it closed on a new $100 million unsecured, revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the five-year, committed facility will be available for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and to replace borrowings under Apogee's previously existing $125 million unsecured, revolving credit facility, which was terminated upon closing of the new facility.
 
"Since closing our previous credit facility in April 2002, we have reduced our outstanding debt by more than $24 million, while improving our debt-to-total-capital ratio to 17 percent. The much improved terms and conditions associated with our new, unsecured facility are indicative of this significantly improved financial condition," said William F. Marchido, Apogee chief financial officer. "The reduction of our credit facility from the previous $125 million to the current $100 million illustrates our confidence in our growth strategies, while at the same time controlling working capital. We have also negotiated an uncommitted expansion feature on our credit facility of $75 million, which will give us flexibility as we further develop our growth strategies."
 
BNY Capital Markets, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank serve as co-lead arrangers of the new facility. The Bank of New York serves as administrative agent of the new facility, and U.S. Bank National Association and Harris Trust and Savings Bank serve as co-syndication and co-documentation agents. Additional lenders under the new facility include Comerica Bank and Wells Fargo Bank.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the shareholder-approved 2002 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the "2002 Stock Plan") of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. ("Apogee"), Apogee's non-employee directors automatically receive, upon election or re-election to the Board, both an automatic fixed grant of non-qualified stock options to purchase 4,000 shares of Apogee common stock and a variable, dollar-denominated non-qualified stock option grant such that the total number of shares subject to both types of options provide Apogee's non-employee directors with total dollar-denominated, equity-based compensation equal to the dollar-denominated, equity-based compensation received by non-employee directors in the 50th percentile of a comparator group of public companies. The total number of shares subject to both types of non-qualified options granted in any one calendar year, however, may not exceed 10,000 shares per non-employee director. These stock options vest in full six months after the date of grant, generally terminate ten years after the date of grant, and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of Apogee's common stock on the date of grant. The non-qualified options become immediately exercisable in full upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the Non-Employee Director Stock Option Agreement (the "Non-Employee Director Option Agreement"). The options may not be transferred by a director except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and the options may only be exercised during the director's lifetime.

NEWS RELEASE
 
 
 
For Immediate Release
Monday, June 20, 2005
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 20, 2005)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2006 first quarter earnings. Apogee develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.
 
FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
 
"We started the fiscal year exceeding our expectations and are optimistic that momentum is building," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our first quarter revenues and earnings were ahead of prior year and our fiscal 2006 plan, as our architectural segment continues to grow market share in an improving commercial construction market and our picture framing business experiences better than expected conversion to higher value-added glass products."

OUTLOOK
 
"Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our performance to date and ongoing market conditions," Huffer said. "Building on the positive trends we are experiencing in our architectural and picture framing businesses, we are increasing our fiscal 2006 full-year guidance to $0.74 to $0.80 per share, up from previous guidance of $0.72 to $0.76 per share. We are also increasing our revenue guidance for the year to 9 to 11 percent growth, up from 6 to 8 percent."
 
Factors impacting Apogee's performance within this increased earnings per share range include:
 
 
 
"We are expecting stronger architectural segment revenue growth as markets further improve and we continue to gain share, including from the exit of a smaller architectural glass competitor," he said. "Our guidance for fiscal 2006 architectural revenue is being raised to 10 to 12 percent growth, from the previous rate of 6 to 9 percent growth. Our expected growth surpasses the F.W. Dodge outlook for our year of 4 percent improvement in the non-residential construction market." Dodge's estimate for calendar 2004 correlates to Apogee's fiscal 2006 due to the average nine-month lag between project starts and the installation of glass on buildings.
 
"In addition, we anticipate that strong growth in sales of value-added picture framing glass will continue, and as a result, are increasing our large-scale optical segment operating margin guidance for fiscal 2006 to 13 to 14 percent, from 12 percent," said Huffer. "We're seeing a better product mix in the segment as the market converts to higher-margin products, and we move away from less-profitable consumer electronics products faster than expected.
 
"Our longer-term goal is to achieve an average of 8 percent annual revenue growth and 20 percent annual earnings per share growth over the three-year period from fiscal 2006 to 2008," he said. "We expect continued improvement in architectural segment margins as we see market share growth in more attractive segments of the market, including new office construction and building renovation. For our large-scale optical segment, we anticipate maintaining current margin levels over the period with continued conversion to value-added products.
 
"We are excited about our prospects for the current year, as our initiatives deliver results and our architectural markets strengthen," said Huffer.
 
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2006. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The discussion above, including all statements in the Outlook section, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: Operational risks within (A) the Architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow; ii) economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully utilize production capacity; v) integration of the AWallS acquisition in a timely and cost-efficient manner; and vi) completion and production ramp-up of the Viracon capacity expansion in a timely and cost-efficient manner; (B) the Large-Scale Optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of
 
 
customers; and iii) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities; and (C) the Auto Glass segment: i) transition of markets served, as the long-term supply agreement with PPG Industries for auto replacement windshields expires in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and product is then marketed to independent distributors; ii) changes in market dynamics; iii) market seasonality; iv) highly competitive, fairly mature industry; and v) performance of the PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) the possibility of a material product liability event; iii) the costs of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; and v) foreign currency risk related to discontinued operations. The company cautions readers that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The company wishes to caution investors that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Exhibit 99.1 to the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2005.

Item 1.01 Entry into Material Definitive Agreements.
 
On June 21, 2005, at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. ("Apogee"), the shareholders approved amendments to Apogee's 2002 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan") and to its Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "EMIP"). In addition, effective on June 20, 2005, Apogee and Mark A. Burke, a member of the Board of Directors of Apogee ("Burke"), entered into an Agreement and Release dated as of June 17, 2005. The Omnibus Plan and the EMIP, each as amended to date, are incorporated by reference into this Form 8-K from the definitive proxy statement of Apogee for its 2005 annual meeting, filed on May 12, 2005, and are filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, hereto. The Agreement and Release with Burke is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
. On April 11, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted the Omnibus Plan, which became effective upon approval of Apogee's shareholders on June 18, 2002. The amendments to the Omnibus Plan approved by Apogee's shareholders on June 21, 2005 eliminate the provisions restricting grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards to 360,000 shares of common stock of Apogee. No other amendments to the Omnibus Plan were approved by Apogee's shareholders on June 21, 2005. The elimination of the provisions restricting grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance awards are designed to enable Apogee to implement its new compensation program for executive compensation adopted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Omnibus Plan, as amended, authorizes the grant of stock options and several other types of stock-based awards.
Omnibus Plan
 
. On April 11, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted the EMIP, which was approved by Apogee's shareholders on June 18, 2002 and became effective as of March 3, 2002. The amendments to the Omnibus Plan approved by Apogee's shareholders on June 21, 2005 expand the business criteria on which performance goals may be based and extend the term of the EMIP through February 26, 2011. By approving these amendments, the shareholders enabled compensation paid in accordance with the terms of the EMIP to qualify as "performance-based compensation," as defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
EMIP
 
As amended, the business criteria for the performance goals authorized to be utilized by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apogee when setting incentive compensation targets for qualifying executives under the EMIP are as follows: economic value added, sales or revenues, costs or expenses, net profit after tax, gross profit, operating profit, base earnings, earnings (whether before or after taxes), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a percent of net sales, return on actual or pro forma equity or net assets or capital, net capital employed, earnings per share (basic or diluted), earnings per share from continuing operations, operating income, pre-tax income, operating income margin, net income, total shareholder return or profitability, or both, as measured by one or more of the following accounting ratios: return on revenue, return on assets, return on equity, return on invested capital and return on investments, shareholder return including performance (total shareholder return) relative to the Standard & Poor's Small Cap 600 Index or similar index or performance (total stockholder return) relative to the proxy comparator group, in both cases as determined pursuant to Rule 402(l) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, cash generation, cash flow (including free cash flow and cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities or any combination thereof), unit volume and change in working capital.
 
. The Agreement and Release provides for the payment by Apogee to Burke of $21,130 to cover the after-tax costs of his COBRA health care coverage under an existing Apogee plan for non-employee directors. In addition, this agreement provides for the exchange of mutual releases between Apogee and Burke with respect to direct claims by either party against the other regarding Burke's activity both as a member of the Board of Directors of Apogee and as a consultant to Apogee.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 14, 2005)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2006 second quarter earnings. Apogee develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.
 
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
 
"Continuing our momentum, we have completed another solid quarter, with growth in both revenues and earnings," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We remain optimistic about our outlook for the second half.
 
"In the second quarter, our picture framing business achieved strong sales of higher value-added products," he said. "Our architectural segment grew revenues as it gained share, and our backlog strength led to the decision to build a third architectural glass facility. This progress was somewhat offset by production inefficiency related to equipment installation and maintenance, charges to realign our window business and work on some lower margin projects that are nearing completion."

OUTLOOK
 
"Looking ahead, we are encouraged by our performance to date and improving market conditions," Huffer said. "We are reaffirming our guidance range for the year of $0.74 to $0.80 per share. We expect that our revenue growth will be at the higher end of our current 9 to 11 percent range.
 
"For the remainder of the year, we are anticipating a stronger operating performance from our architectural segment," said Huffer, "while we expect that second half growth will be lower than first half growth for the large-scale optical segment.
 
"As we start the second half of our fiscal year, our architectural segment is building momentum," he said. "Markets are strengthening, and we're seeing pricing improvement in our architectural glass business. Our backlog strength is also very encouraging.
 
"We intend to capitalize on operating improvements throughout the architectural segment and to leverage overhead costs as revenues continue to increase," Huffer said. "We are positioned for the margin improvement necessary to meet our full-year guidance of a 3.6 to 4.0 percent operating margin for the architectural segment.
 
"In our large-scale optical segment, we are anticipating stronger full year growth but a different seasonality, with the first half stronger than the second, driven by inventory and promotion activities at some of our national retail accounts," he said.
 
"We expect that our auto glass manufacturing business will meet guidance of break-even performance for the year, while generating cash," he added.
 
"We are excited about our prospects for the current year, as our strategic initiatives deliver results and our architectural markets strengthen," said Huffer.

For Immediate Release
 
Tuesday, September 13, 2005
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 13, 2005)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced that it plans to build a new architectural glass fabrication plant as part of the company's strategy to grow in this market. Apogee will invest approximately $25 million in the new facility, which is to be located in the Southwest, to increase its Viracon glass fabrication capacity by approximately $40 million when the plant is at full capacity.
 
Viracon, the market leader for complex architectural glass products for high-profile projects, today is announcing its new plant to customers attending the GlassBuild America show in Atlanta.
 
"This new plant, which should begin operating in about 18 months, will help us meet demand that is outpacing capacity for complex high-performance fabricated architectural glass for commercial buildings," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "To better serve customers in the meantime, we have new capacity coming on line from the recent expansion of our Georgia plant, and are making additional capital investments this year in both our Georgia and Minnesota facilities to further expand capacity next year.
 
"We have selected the Southwest market for the plant for two reasons," he said. "First, we will be able to better serve the growing West Coast market with value-added products. And, second, having a plant in the Southwest gives us the opportunity to expand beyond core projects and increase our market share."
 
The site selection process for the plant is underway, with groundbreaking targeted for the spring of 2006 and initial startup a year later; it will ramp up to full capacity about a year after startup. The new facility will provide the full spectrum of Viracon products, including high-performance coatings for energy-efficiency and laminated glass for security/blast-resistant products for office, education, health care and institutional markets.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Amendment to the Partnership Plan
 
On October 19, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated 1987 Partnership Plan (the "Partnership Plan") to reduce the number of shares reserved for issuance under the plan by 600,000 shares (the "Amendment").
 
The Partnership Plan, a plan designed to increase the ownership of the Company's stock by key employees, allows participants selected by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to defer earned incentive compensation through the purchase of the Company's common stock. The purchased stock is then matched by an equal award of restricted stock, which vests over a predetermined period.
 
As previously disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for its 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Compensation Committee has implemented a new executive compensation program for fiscal 2006 (the "New Program"). In connection with the New Program, the Compensation Committee has determined to cease offering participation in the Partnership Plan for fiscal 2006 and beyond. Because the Partnership Plan is no longer a part of the Company's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee determined to decrease the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Partnership Plan by 600,000 shares.
 
A copy of the Partnership Plan has been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Appendix A-2 to the Company's proxy statement for its 2001 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. In addition, a copy of an amendment to the Partnership Plan has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit A to the Company's proxy statement for its 2003 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. A copy of the Amendment is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Retainer for Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Finance Committee Chairs
 
On October 20, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved an annual retainer of $4,000 to be paid to the Chairs of the Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Finance committees, effective July 1, 2005. A summary sheet outlining the compensation paid by the Company to its non-employee directors is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
(c) Exhibits.
 
The following exhibits are being filed with this Current Report on Form 8-K:
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
Date: October 24, 2005
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.1
 
 
This Amendment to the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan (as amended to date, the "Plan") is made and entered as of October 19, 2005. All terms used in this Amendment shall have the same meaning as in the Plan.
 
The Plan is amended as set forth below.
 
1. Section 6.08 of the Plan is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
 
6.08. Shares Subject to Plan. Apogee hereby authorizes Two Million Twenty Thousand (2,020,000) shares of Common Stock to be issued or purchased and designated as Pool A Common Stock pursuant to this Plan. Any Pool A shares that are returned to Apogee by Disqualification may be added to the number of shares available under the Plan for the purpose of funding Pool A.
 
2. Section 7.12 of the Plan is amended in its entirety to read as follows:
 
7.12. Shares Subject to Plan. Apogee hereby authorizes One Million Three Hundred Eighty Thousand (1,380,000) shares of Common Stock to be issued or purchased and designated as Pool B Restricted Stock pursuant to the Plan. Any Restricted Stock awarded to Participants that are returned to Apogee by forfeiture or disqualification may be added to the number of shares available under the Plan for the purpose of funding Pool B.
 
Except as specifically amended hereby, the Plan shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof.
 
The foregoing Amendment No. 9 was approved by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. in accordance with the terms
of the Plan as of October 19, 2005:
 
APOGEE ENTERPRISES, INC.
 

EXHIBIT 10.2
 
 
Retainer and Fees
 
The Company's non-employee directors receive the following retainers and fees:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stock Options
 
Non-employee directors also receive both an automatic fixed grant of options to purchase 4,000 shares of the Company's common stock and a variable, dollar-denominated stock option grant such that the total number of shares subject to both types of options will provide the Company's non-employee directors with total dollar-denominated, equity-based compensation equal to the dollar-denominated, equity-based compensation received by non-employee directors in the 50th percentile of a comparator group of public companies. However, the total number of shares subject to both types of options granted in any one calendar year may not exceed 10,000 shares per non-employee director. These stock options vest in full six months after the date of grant and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.
 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
 
Non-employee directors also may elect to participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Under the plan, participants can purchase the Company's common stock by contributing up to $500 per week, with the Company contributing an amount equal to 15% of each participant's weekly contribution.
 
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors
 
Non-employee directors also may elect to participate in the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Under the plan, participants may defer a portion of their annual retainer and meeting fees into deferred stock accounts. The Company matches 10% of the elected deferral. Each participating director receives a credit of shares of the Company's common stock in an amount equal to the amount deferred divided by the fair market value of one share as of the crediting date. These accounts also are credited, as of the crediting date, with an amount equal to the dividend paid on one share of the Company's common stock multiplied by the number of
shares credited to each account. Participating directors may elect to receive the amounts credited to their accounts at a fixed date, at age 70 or following death or retirement from the Board of Directors. The amounts will be paid out in the form of shares of the Company's common stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares) either in a lump sum or in installments, at the participating director's election.

OUTLOOK
 
"We have increased our fiscal 2006 guidance to $0.81 to $0.87 per share to reflect the net tax benefits, and management is focused on delivering results in the top half of this range," Huffer said. "We are encouraged by our performance to date and improving market conditions. The timing of project flow in the fourth quarter could impact our performance within the guidance range.
 
"We have slightly increased our revenue outlook to growth of 10 to 12 percent for the current year," he added.
 
"In the fourth quarter, we are anticipating a stronger operating performance from our architectural segment, which continues to build momentum," said Huffer. "Markets are strengthening, we're seeing pricing increases in our architectural glass business, and project mix is improving in both our installation and architectural glass operations with the flow of our backlog. The strength of our backlog is also very encouraging, with a solid fourth quarter position and a good base of business going into next year.
 
"Our full-year outlook for the architectural segment includes slightly stronger revenue growth than previously expected and somewhat lower full-year margins than prior guidance. The margin change results from the carryover effect of unplanned equipment downtime and startup of new equipment earlier in the year," he said.
 
"In our large-scale optical segment, we are anticipating stronger full year sales versus the prior year, driven by growth in the first half," he said. "We expect that our auto glass manufacturing business will meet guidance of break-even performance for the year, while generating cash.
 
"We are excited about our prospects for the current year, as our strategic initiatives deliver results and our architectural markets strengthen," said Huffer.
 
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2006. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. ("Apogee") has had in place severance agreements with its executive officers since 1999. In October 2004, Apogee's Compensation Committee approved new severance agreements for Apogee's executive officers. On January 5, 2005, each of the following executive officers executed a new severance agreement, the form of which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to Apogee's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 7, 2005 (the "2005 Severance Agreements"), which was effective as of January 1, 2005:
 
 
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 became effective during 2005, which among other things, amended the Internal Revenue Code to add new Section 409A ("Section 409A"), which imposes certain excise taxes upon many forms of "deferred compensation" unless they comply with the requirements of Section 409A. In order to comply with Section 409A, on January 24, 2006, Apogee and each of the executive officers listed above entered into an amendment to their 2005 Severance Agreement (the "First Amendment to the 2005 Severance Agreement"). The First Amendment to the 2005 Severance Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein, contains changes to the definition of "termination of employment." In addition, the First Amendment to the 2005 Severance Agreement provides that, if the executive officer is a "key employee" (as defined in Section 409A), payment of certain deferred benefits under the Amended and Restated 1987 Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan, as amended, will not be made before the date that is six months after the employment termination date.
 
On January 24, 2006, Apogee's Board of Directors also approved a revised form of severance agreement that complies with Section 409A (the "2006 Severance Agreement"). Consistent with the 2005 Severance Agreement, the 2006 Severance Agreement is designed to retain the executive officers and provide for continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of Apogee (as "change in control" is defined in the 2006 Severance Agreement). The 2006 Severance Agreement provides that, in the event of a change in control of Apogee, each executive officer would have specific rights and receive specified benefits if the executive officer is terminated without cause or the executive officer voluntarily terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined in the 2006 Severance Agreement) within two years after the change in control. In these circumstances, executive officers will each receive a severance payment equal to either one or two times the executive officer's annual salary plus the executive's targeted annual bonus (as calculated under the terms of the 2006 Severance Agreement). The form of 2006 Severance Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Also on January 24, 2006, Apogee and Daniel Mayleben, Apogee's Chief Information Officer, executed a 2006 Severance Agreement. Mr. Mayleben's agreement provides that, in the circumstances described above, Mr. Mayleben will receive a severance payment equal to two times his annual salary plus his targeted annual bonus (as calculated under the terms of Mr. Mayleben's agreement).
 
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
The Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 1997 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the "1997 Plan") was approved by Apogee's shareholders at the 1997 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Shares of Apogee's common stock remained available for issuance with respect to possible future awards that could be made under the 1997 Plan. Because Apogee's Compensation Committee determined that it would not be making any further awards under the 1997 Plan, on January 24, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the termination of the 1997 Plan, effective immediately. In accordance with Section 8(a) of the 1997 Plan, all currently outstanding awards previously made under the 1997 Plan will remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms and the terms of the 1997 Plan governing such
outstanding awards. In addition, the 225,526 remaining shares of Apogee's common stock that were previously reserved for future issuance under the 1997 Plan have been released from such reservation and are available for other corporate purposes. All other shares previously reserved for future issuance with respect to any awards previously made under the 1997 Plan that are forfeited after the date hereof will not be deemed reserved after the date of such forfeiture and may be used for other corporate purposes thereafter.
 
The purpose of the 1997 Plan was to promote the interests of Apogee and its shareholders by aiding Apogee in attracting and retaining management personnel and non-employee directors capable of providing strategic direction to, and assuring the future success of, Apogee, to offer such personnel and directors and other employees incentives to put forth maximum efforts for the success of Apogee's business, and to afford such personnel and directors an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in Apogee, thereby aligning the interests of such personnel and directors with Apogee's shareholders. The 1997 Plan permitted the granting of a variety of different types of awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance awards and other awards valued in whole or in part by reference to Apogee's common stock.
 
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
Because of the cost savings and administrative efficiencies associated with uncertificated shares, on January 24, 2006, Apogee's Board of Directors determined that it was in Apogee's best interest to authorize Apogee's transfer agent to issue uncertificated shares for Apogee's common stock on a going-forward basis, and to record shareholders' positions in Apogee's common stock using the "Direct Registration Statement System," or the "DRS System," so that certificated shares would no longer be issued for Apogee's common stock, except for restricted shares of common stock and upon request by a recordholder or beneficial owner for certificated shares. In connection with this determination, Apogee's Board of Directors approved amendments to Article IV of Apogee's Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective as of January 24, 2006, authorizing the issuance of uncertificated shares of Apogee's common stock as circumstances permit, except in the case of restricted shares of common stock and upon request by a recordholder or beneficial owner for certificated shares.
 
Article IV, as amended and restated in its entirety, reads as follows:
 
 
Section 4.01. Stock Certificates. The shares of the corporation may be either certificated shares or uncertificated shares or a combination thereof. A resolution approved by a majority of the directors may provide that some or all of any or all classes and series of the shares of the corporation will be uncertificated shares. Each holder of duly issued certificated shares of the corporation shall be entitled to a certificate for such shares, to be in such form as shall be prescribed by law and adopted by the Board of Directors. Certificates for such shares shall be numbered in the order in which they shall be issued and shall be signed, in the name of the corporation, by the president, the secretary or any assistant secretary, if there be one, or by such officers as the Board of Directors may designate. If a certificate is signed by a transfer agent or registrar, the signature of any such officer of the corporation may be a facsimile signature. If a person signs or has a facsimile signature placed upon a certificate while an officer, transfer agent or registrar of the corporation, the certificate may be issued by the corporation even if the person has ceased to serve in that capacity before the certificate is issued, with the same effect as if the person had that capacity at the date of its issue. With respect to certificated shares, every certificate surrendered to the corporation or its transfer agent for exchange or transfer shall be canceled, and no new certificate or certificates shall be issued in exchange for any existing certificate until such existing certificate shall have been so canceled, except in cases provided for in Section 4.04.
 
Section 4.02. Transfer of Shares. The transfer of shares on the stock transfer books of the corporation may be authorized only by the shareholder of record thereof, or by such shareholder's legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of authority to transfer, or by such shareholder's duly authorized attorney-in-fact, and, in the case of certificated shares, upon surrender of the certificate or the certificates for such shares to the corporation or its transfer agent duly endorsed.
Section 4.03. Ownership. The corporation may treat as the exclusive owner of shares of the corporation for all purposes, the person or persons in whose name shares are registered on the books of the corporation, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as may be expressly provided by applicable law.
 
Section 4.04. Lost or Destroyed Certificates. Any shareholder claiming a certificate for shares to be lost, stolen or destroyed shall make an affidavit of that fact in such form as the Board of Directors shall require and shall give the corporation a bond of indemnity in form, in an amount, and with one or more sureties satisfactory to the Board of Directors, to indemnify the corporation against any claim which may be made against it on account of the reissue of such certificate, whereupon a new certificate may be issued in the same tenor and for the same number of shares as the one alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
 
In addition, Apogee's Board of Directors approved amendments to Article III of Apogee's Amended and Restated Bylaws, effective January 24, 2006, replacing gender specific pronouns in such Article with gender neutral titles.
 
Apogee's Amended and Restated Bylaws are attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

4. .
Benefits upon Termination under Section 2(b)(iii)
 
(a) .
After a Change in Control
 
(i) Upon the termination (voluntary or involuntary) of the employment of Executive pursuant to Section 2(b)(iii) hereof, Executive shall be entitled to receive the benefits specified in this Section 4. The amounts due to Executive under subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Section 4(a) shall be paid to Executive not later than one business day prior to the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective (the "Employment Termination Date"). All benefits to Executive pursuant to this Section 4(a) shall be subject to any applicable income, payroll or other taxes required by law to be withheld. As used in Subsection 4(a)(iii), the term, "termination of employment," and other similar terms used in such Subsection, shall be construed to have the same meaning as is given to the term, "Separation from Service," in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")."
(ii) The Company shall pay to Executive (A) the full base salary earned by him and unpaid through the date that the termination of Executive's employment becomes effective, at the rate in effect at the time written notice of termination (voluntary or involuntary) was given, (B) any amount earned by Executive as a bonus with respect to the fiscal year of the Company preceding the termination of his employment if such bonus has not theretofore been paid to Executive, and (C) an amount representing credit for any vacation earned or accrued by him but not taken.
 
(iii) In lieu of any further base salary payments to Executive for periods subsequent to the Employment Termination Date, the Company shall pay as severance pay to Executive (a "Severance Payment") a lump-sum cash amount equal to the sum of:
 
 
 
(iv) The Company shall also pay to Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by Executive as a result of such termination of employment (including all fees and expenses, if any, incurred by Executive in seeking to obtain or enforce any right or benefit provided to Executive by this Agreement whether by arbitration or otherwise);
 
(v) Notwithstanding any other agreement in existence between the Company and Executive at the Employment Termination Date, all stock options or shares of restricted stock owned or held by Executive or promised to be payable to Executive by the Company shall be immediately vested in Executive without further restriction and Executive shall be treated at that time as the unrestricted owner of such Company stock options and stock, subject to applicable constraints under federal and state securities laws; and
 
(vi) Any and all contracts, agreements or arrangements between the Company and/or any other Apogee Entity and Executive prohibiting or restricting Executive from owning, operating, participating in, or providing employment or consulting services to, any business or company competitive with the Company or such other Apogee Entity at any time or during any period after the Employment Termination Date, shall be deemed terminated and of no further force or effect as of the Employment Termination Date, to
the extent, but only to the extent, such contracts, agreements or arrangements so prohibit or restrict Executive; provided that, the foregoing provision shall not constitute a license or right to use any proprietary information of the Company or such other Apogee Entity and shall in no way affect any such contracts, agreements or arrangements insofar as they relate to nondisclosure and nonuse of proprietary information of the Company or such other Apogee Entity notwithstanding the fact that such nondisclosure and nonuse may prohibit or restrict Executive in certain competitive activities.
 
(b) Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Section 4 by seeking other employment or otherwise. The amount of any payment or benefit provided in this Section 4 shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as a result of any employment by another employer.
 
(c) Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall cause its independent auditors promptly to review, at the Company's sole expense, the applicability of Section 4999 of the Code to the "Total Payments" (as defined in Section 4(d) below) to be received by Executive. If such auditors determine that, after taking into account the provisions of Section 4(d) hereof, any of the Total Payments would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or any interest or penalties with respect to such tax (such excise tax, together with interest and penalties, are collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then, in addition to any amounts payable under foregoing provisions of this Section 4, the Company shall pay an additional cash payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") within 30 days of such determination equal to the Excise Tax imposed on the Total Payments, including any Excise Tax or any other income taxes that may be imposed on such Gross-Up Payment. If no determination by the Company's auditors is made prior to the time a tax return reflecting the Total Payments is required to be filed by Executive, Executive will be entitled to receive a Gross-Up Payment calculated on the basis of the Total Payments reported by him in such tax return, within 30 days of the filing of such tax return. In all events, if any tax authority determines that a greater Excise Tax should be imposed on the Total Payments than is determined by the Company's independent auditors or reflected in Executive's tax return pursuant to this subparagraph (c), Executive shall be entitled to receive the full Gross-Up Payment calculated on the basis of the amount of Excise Tax determined to be payable by such tax authority from the Company within 30 days of such determination.
 
(d) As used herein, "Total Payments" shall mean, collectively, any payment or benefit received or to be received by Executive in connection with a Change in Control of the Company or termination of Executive's employment (whether payable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, contract, agreement or arrangement with the Company, with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company or with any person constituting a member of an "affiliated group" as defined in Section 280G(d)(5) of the Code) with the Company or with any person whose actions result in a Change in Control of the Company. For purposes of calculating Total Payments, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which Executive shall have effectively waived in writing prior to the date of payment of the Severance Payment shall be taken into account; (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which in the opinion of tax counsel selected by the Company and acceptable to Executive does not constitute a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code; (iii) the value of any benefit provided by Section
4(a)(vi) of this Agreement shall not be taken into account in computing Total Payments; and (iv) the value of any other non-cash benefit or of any deferred cash payment included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code. In case of uncertainty as to whether all or some portion of a payment is or is not payable to Executive under this Agreement, the Company shall initially make the payment to Executive, and Executive agrees to refund to the Company any amounts ultimately determined not to have been payable under the terms hereof.
 
(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if Executive is a "key employee" (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), payment of Executive's benefit otherwise due under Subsection 4(a)(iii) hereof shall not be paid before the date that is six (6) months after the Employment Termination Date. No later than the third (3
rd
) business day thereafter, Executive shall receive all payments, without interest, which Executive was entitled to receive under Subsection 4(a)(iii) of this Agreement.
 
5. .
Successors and Binding Agreement
 
(a) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company), by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as Executive would be entitled hereunder if Executive terminated his employment after a Change in Control for Good Reason, except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Employment Termination Date. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company and any successor to its business and/or assets which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 5(a) or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.
 
(b) This Agreement is personal to Executive, and Executive may not assign or transfer any part of his rights or duties hereunder, or any compensation due to him hereunder, to any other person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.
 
6. . Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that Executive engages counsel to arbitrate any dispute hereunder (which arbitration results in an award to Executive of any kind) or to enforce such an award, all costs and expenses incurred by Executive, including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, with respect to such arbitration or enforcement thereof shall be reimbursed to Executive by the Company promptly upon Executive's submission of a request therefor.
Arbitration
7. . No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed by Executive and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board of Directors of the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time.
Modification; Waiver
 
8. . All notices, requests, demands and all other communications required or permitted by either party to the other party by this Agreement (including, without limitation, any notice of termination of employment and any notice of an intention to arbitrate) shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered personally or received by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, at the address of the other party, as first written above (directed to the attention of the Board of Directors and Corporate Secretary in the case of the Company). Either party hereto may change its address for purposes of this Section 8 by giving 15 days' prior notice to the other party hereto.
Notice
 
9. . If any term or provision of this Agreement or the application hereof to any person or circumstances shall to any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement or the application of such term or provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision of this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Severability
 
10. . This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
 
11. . This Agreement has been executed and delivered in the State of Minnesota and shall in all respects be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of Minnesota, including all matters of construction, validity and performance.
Governing Law
 
12. . The Company and Executive understand and agree that this Agreement is intended to reflect their agreement only with respect to payments and benefits upon termination in certain cases and is not intended to create any obligation on the part of either party to continue employment. This Agreement supersedes any and all other oral or written agreements or policies made relating to the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof; provided that this Agreement shall not supersede or limit in any way Executive's rights under any benefit plan, program or arrangements in accordance with their terms.
Effect of Agreement; Entire Agreement
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Agreement to be executed in its name by a duly authorized director and officer, and Executive has hereunto set his hand, all as of the date first written above.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, February 1, 2006
 
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (February 1, 2006)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2007 guidance and reaffirmed guidance for fiscal 2006, which ends February 25, 2006. Apogee develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.
 
"We are looking forward to another year of improved performance, as commercial construction markets continue to improve and we execute our updated five-year strategic plan for growth," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and CEO. "We are anticipating earnings of $0.88 to $0.94 per share for fiscal 2007, which includes the required expensing of options. This is strong earnings growth compared to fiscal 2006, which includes the impact of one-time net tax benefits. These anticipated earnings are based on expected revenue growth of 5 to 9 percent.
 
"We are focused on delivering results in the top half of our fiscal 2006 guidance range of $0.81 to $0.87 per share," Huffer said. "As we stated at the end of the third quarter, timing of project flow as we finish the year could impact our performance within this guidance range."
 
The following summarizes fiscal 2006 and 2007 earnings per share guidance:

"Our architectural markets continue to improve, and we expect to gain further share through strong sales of our value-added products and services, including energy-efficient, and hurricane and blast resistant products and systems," said Huffer. "We also anticipate a solid performance in our large-scale optical segment, as sales and earnings normalize after strategic changes that led to significant growth in revenues and earnings the prior two years.
 
"Apogee has also updated its strategic initiatives for growth, which continue to focus on expanding its markets for architectural and picture framing glass products," said Huffer. "Our longer-term goals of 8 percent annual growth in revenues and 20 percent growth in earnings per share support our objective of being a great $1 billion company within five years. Our strategic plan supports our vision: Distinctive solutions by Apogee . . . for enclosing commercial buildings and framing art."
 
Building on its strategic plan, Apogee has updated its priorities to support growth to $1 billion in revenues over the next five years:

The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: Operational risks within (A) the Architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow; ii) economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully utilize production capacity; v) integration of the AWallS acquisition in a timely and cost-efficient manner; vi) production ramp-up of the Viracon capacity expansion in Georgia in a timely and cost-efficient manner; and vii) construction and ramp-up to full production of the announced third Viracon plant in a timely and cost-efficient manner; (B) the Large-Scale Optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities; and (C) the Auto Glass segment: i) transition of markets served as Viracon/Curvlite focuses on selling to aftermarket manufacturers following the end of its long-term supply agreement with PPG Industries in the second quarter of fiscal 2006; ii) changes in market dynamics; iii) market seasonality; iv) highly competitive, fairly mature industry; and v) performance of the PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) the possibility of a material product liability event; iii) the costs of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; and v) foreign currency risk related to discontinued operations. The company cautions readers that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The company wishes to caution investors that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

On April 5, 2006, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. A copy of this press release is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.

FY06 FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"We built momentum throughout fiscal 2006, as our architectural markets further strengthened, and we are solidly positioned for fiscal 2007," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We saw strong growth in revenues and earnings due to improved results in our strategic architectural and picture framing businesses.
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.
Page 2
"Our full-year expectations for the architectural segment operating margin fell slightly short at 3.2 percent, versus our guidance of 3.4 to 3.6 percent," he said. "Although we had improved operational performance in the rest of the architectural segment, our margin was adversely impacted by the glass installation business. As certain glass installation projects neared completion late in the year, our project costs were higher than anticipated, and we also had a higher mix of lower margin, older projects in this business. We are confident that our improved project selection process and improved market conditions will help us deliver better performance in fiscal 2007.
"Our architectural segment overall did see continued improvement in operations, commercial construction markets and pricing in the fourth quarter," said Huffer. "Large-scale optical segment results for the quarter reflected the unusual first-half inventory and promotion activities at some of our national retail accounts. Our fourth quarter picture framing sales and earnings were down compared to the prior-year period as the strong fiscal 2006 first half displaced value-added sales in the current quarter."

OUTLOOK
"We are looking forward to another year of improved performance, as commercial construction markets continue to strengthen and we provide value-added products and services to meet energy-efficient, hurricane- and blast-resistant building requirements," said Huffer. "Our strong architectural backlog of more than $300 million in work, which is almost half of our expected fiscal 2007 architectural revenues, gives us confidence in our outlook for the year.
"We are poised for strong improvement in architectural segment operating margins in fiscal 2007," he said. "Strong markets and backlog, combined with our new capacity and improved factory operations, support our achievement of higher margins. In addition, we expect improved execution and project selection in our glass installation business.
"We also anticipate another year of solid performance in our large-scale optical segment, with continued conversion of the market to value-added picture framing glass that reduces fading and reflection," said Huffer. "We are seeing some recent changes in national retail chains that offer custom framing, which raise some uncertainty as we enter fiscal 2007.
"We are anticipating earnings of $0.88 to $0.94 per share for fiscal 2007, which includes $0.05 per share for the non-cash expensing of options. This is strong earnings growth compared to fiscal 2006, which included the impact of one-time net tax benefits of $0.07 per share in the third quarter," he said. "These anticipated earnings are based on expected revenue growth of 5 to 9 percent. This outlook will help us achieve our longer-term goals of 8 percent annual growth in revenues and 20 percent growth in earnings per share over our current five-year strategic plan."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2007. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

EXHIBIT 10.1
Retainer and Fees
The Company's non-employee directors receive the following retainers and fees:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stock Options
Non-employee directors also receive both an automatic fixed grant of options to purchase 4,000 shares of the Company's common stock and a variable, dollar-denominated stock option grant such that the total number of shares subject to both types of options will provide the Company's non-employee directors with total dollar-denominated, equity-based compensation equal to the dollar-denominated, equity-based compensation received by non-employee directors in the 50th percentile of a comparator group of public companies. However, the total number of shares subject to both types of options granted in any one calendar year may not exceed 10,000 shares per non-employee director. These stock options vest in full six months after the date of grant and have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Non-employee directors also may elect to participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Under the plan, participants can purchase the Company's common stock by contributing up to $500 per week, with the Company contributing an amount equal to 15% of each participant's weekly contribution.
Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors
Non-employee directors also may elect to participate in the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Under the plan, participants may defer a portion of their annual retainer and meeting fees into deferred stock accounts. The Company matches 10% of the elected deferral. Each participating director receives a credit of shares of the Company's common stock in an amount equal to the amount deferred divided by the fair market value of one share as of the crediting date. These accounts also are credited, as of the crediting date, with
an amount equal to the dividend paid on one share of the Company's common stock multiplied by the number of shares credited to each account. Participating directors may elect to receive the amounts credited to their accounts at a fixed date, at age 70 or following death or retirement from the Board of Directors. The amounts will be paid out in the form of shares of the Company's common stock (plus cash in lieu of fractional shares) either in a lump sum or in installments, at the participating director's election.
Group Medical and Dental Insurance Plan
Non-employee directors also may elect to participate in the Company's group welfare plan, which provides medical and dental insurance coverage to the Company's employees. Non-employee directors may obtain single or family medical and dental coverage on the same terms as the Company's employees.
Charitable Matching Contributions Program for Non-Employee Directors
Under the charitable matching contributions program for eligible non-employee directors, the Company will match cash or publicly traded stock contributions made to cultural, educational, social, medical or health related charitable organizations that are exempt from federal income tax and qualify as a charity to which individuals can make a tax-deductible contribution. The maximum amount that will be matched by the Company is $2,000 per eligible non-employee director per calendar year.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
On June 27, 2006, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. A copy of this press release is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Tuesday, June 27, 2006
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 27, 2006)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2007 first quarter earnings. Apogee develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.
FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"We had a solid start to fiscal 2007, with strong revenue and earnings growth in the first quarter," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our operating margins showed improvement from the prior year due to improved market conditions and better operations. And, margins would have been approximately one-half percentage point higher had we not experienced greater than expected health care utilization.

"We had good operational performance in our architectural segment manufacturing businesses," he said. "Also, as we had anticipated, our picture framing business was impacted by a negative mix shift within value-added framing glass.
"We continue to be optimistic about fiscal 2007 as we provide value-added architectural products and services for our stronger commercial construction markets."

OUTLOOK
"We have a good start to fiscal 2007 and expect to show strong earnings growth over the prior year due to more robust commercial construction markets and continued improvement in architectural segment operating performance," said Huffer. "We are maintaining our fiscal 2007 earnings guidance range of $0.88 to $0.94 per share, which includes $0.05 per share for the non-cash expensing of options. This is strong earnings growth compared to fiscal 2006, which at $0.85 per share included the impact of one-time net tax benefits of $0.07 per share.
"We have increased our overall and architectural segment revenue guidance for the year, along with our architectural segment operating margin guidance," he said. "Our strong architectural backlog of $360 million with improving margins gives us confidence in our outlook for the year; approximately $280 million of the backlog is currently scheduled for fiscal 2007.
"The improved outlook for our architectural segment is somewhat offset by a decrease in our expectations for large-scale optical segment revenues and operating margin," Huffer said. "Our large-scale optical segment is seeing some reduced demand due to softness in national retail accounts, partially offset by increases in picture framing glass sales to distributors. In addition, we expect an even less favorable mix of value-added picture framing glass in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year.
"We are pleased to have been notified that we will receive proceeds of approximately $2 million from a class action lawsuit settlement with a flat glass manufacturer covering 1991 to 1995," he said. "The proceeds, which we anticipate receiving as soon as the second quarter, have been included in our earnings outlook. We expect this will be offset by higher health care costs under our current self-insured programs for the balance of the year."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2007. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow; ii) economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully utilize production capacity; and v) construction and ramp-up to full production of the announced third Viracon plant in a timely and cost-efficient manner; (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities; and (C) the auto glass segment: i) transition of markets served as Viracon/Curvlite focuses on selling to aftermarket manufacturers following the end of its long-term supply agreement with PPG Industries in the second quarter of fiscal 2006; ii) changes in market dynamics; iii) market seasonality; iv) highly competitive, fairly mature industry; and v) performance of the PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) the possibility of a material product liability event; iii) the costs of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; and v) foreign currency risk related to discontinued operations. The company cautions readers that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The company wishes to caution investors that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Exercise Price
provided, however
(ii) . The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee; provided that, under all circumstances, no Option shall be granted for a term in excess of 10 years.
Option Term
 
(iii) . The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part and the method or methods by which, and the form or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the relevant exercise price) in which, payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made.
Time and Method of Exercise
(iv) . The Committee may grant Options ("Reload Options"), separately or together with another Option, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions established by the Committee, the Participant would be granted a new Option when the payment of the exercise price of a previously granted Option is made by the delivery of Shares owned by the Participant pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) hereof, and/or when Shares are tendered or withheld as payment of the amount to be withheld under applicable income tax laws in connection with the exercise of an Option, which new Option would be an Option to purchase the number of Shares not exceeding the sum of (A) the number of Shares so provided as consideration upon the exercise of the previously granted Option to which such Reload Option relates and (B) the number of Shares, if any, tendered or withheld as payment of the amount to be withheld under applicable tax laws in connection with the exercise of the Option to which such Reload Option relates pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Plan or agreement relating to such Option. Reload Options may be granted with respect to Options previously granted under the Plan or may be granted in connection with any Option granted under the Plan at the time of such grant. Such Reload Options shall have a per share exercise price equal to the Fair Market Value of one Share as of the date of grant of the Reload Option, and shall have a term not to exceed the remaining term of the Option with respect to which the Reload Option was granted.

Reload Options may be granted only to Participants who are Eligible Persons on the date of grant of a Reload Option. No Reload Option may be exercised less than six months after the date of grant of such Reload Option. Any Reload Option shall be subject to availability of sufficient Shares for grant under the Plan. Shares surrendered as part or all of the exercise price of the Option to which it relates that have been owned by the optionee less than six months will not be counted for purposes of determining the number of Shares that may be purchased pursuant to a Reload Option.

A Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder thereof a right to receive upon exercise thereof the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise (or, if the Committee shall so determine, at any time during a specified period before or after the date of exercise) over (ii) the grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right as specified by the Committee, which price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right.

Restrictions
(ii) . Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by issuance of a stock certificate or certificates, which certificate or certificates shall be held by the Company.

In the case of Restricted Stock Units, no Shares shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted.

(iii) . Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon termination of employment (as determined under criteria established by the Committee) during the applicable restriction period, all Shares of Restricted Stock and all Restricted Stock Units at such time subject to restriction shall be forfeited and reacquired by the Company; , that the Committee may, when it finds that a waiver would be in the best interest of the Company, waive in whole or in part any or all remaining restrictions with respect to Shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units. Any Share representing Restricted Stock that is no longer subject to restrictions shall be delivered to the holder thereof promptly after the applicable restrictions lapse or are waived. Upon the lapse or waiver of restrictions and the restricted period relating to Restricted Stock Units evidencing the right to receive Shares, such Shares shall be issued and delivered to the holders of the Restricted Stock Units.

Performance Awards
The Committee intends to have Performance Awards constitute awards of "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the following additional requirements shall apply to all Performance Awards made to any Participant:
(i) Any Performance Award shall be null and void and have no effect whatsoever unless the Plan shall have been approved by the shareholders of the Company at the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
(ii) The right to receive a Performance Award shall be determined solely on account of the attainment of one or more pre-established, objective performance goals selected by the Committee in connection with the grant of the Performance Award. Such performance goals may apply to the Participant individually, an identifiable business unit of the Company or the Company as a whole. The performance goals shall be based solely on one or more of the following business criteria: economic value added, sales or revenues, costs or expenses, net profit after tax, gross profit, operating profit, base earnings, earnings (whether before or after taxes), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a percent of net sales, return on actual or pro forma equity or net assets or capital, net capital employed, earnings per share (basic or diluted), earnings per share from continuing operations, operating income, pre-tax income, operating income margin, net income, total shareholder return or profitability, or both, as measured by one or more of the following accounting ratios: return on revenue, return on assets, return on equity, return on invested capital and return on investments, shareholder return including performance (total shareholder return) relative to the Standard & Poor's Small Cap 600 Index or similar index or performance (total stockholder return) relative to the proxy comparator group, in both cases as determined pursuant to Rule 402(l) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act, cash generation, cash flow (including free cash flow and cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities or any combination thereof), unit volume and change in working capital. The foregoing shall constitute the sole business criteria upon which the performance goals under this Plan shall be based.
(iii) The target and range of a Participant's possible awards established by the Committee shall be between zero and 300% of the Participant's annual base compensation for the Chief Executive Officer. The target and range of a Participant's possible awards established by the Committee shall be between zero and 200% of the Participant's annual base compensation for each of the Executive Vice Presidents, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Information Officer and the General Counsel. For other Participants, the Committee shall establish such targets and ranges. The maximum bonus which may be
 
paid to any Participant pursuant to any Performance Award with respect to any fiscal year shall not exceed $3,500,000.

(v) Following the close of each performance period and prior to payment of any amount to any Participant under the Plan, the Committee must certify in writing as to the attainment of all factors (including the performance factors for a Participant) upon which any payments to a Participant for that fiscal year are to be based.
(vi) Each of the foregoing provisions, and all of the other terms and conditions of the Plan as it applies to any Performance Award, shall be interpreted in such a fashion so as to qualify all compensation paid thereunder as "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
(e) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Participants such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares), as are deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan; , that such grants must comply with Rule 16b-3 and applicable law. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards. Shares or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted under this Section 6(e) shall be purchased for such consideration, which may be paid by such method or methods and in such form or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property or any combination thereof), as the Committee shall determine, the value of which consideration, as established by the Committee, shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Shares or other securities as of the date such purchase right is granted.

Forms of Payment under Awards
 
(iv) .

Each Award or right under any Award shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant or, if permissible under applicable law, by the Participant's guardian or legal representative. No Award or right under any such Award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate.

Section 7. Awards to Non-Employee Directors
(a) . If the Plan is approved by the shareholders of the Company at the 2002 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Options shall be granted automatically under the plan to each Non-Employee Director under the terms and conditions contained in this Section 7. The authority of the Committee under this Section 7 shall be limited to ministerial and non-discretionary matters. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the 1997 Plan, if the Plan is approved by the Company's shareholders, no further automatic grants of options shall be made to Non-Employee Directors under the 1997 Plan, and all such grants to Non-Employee Directors shall be made solely under the Plan.
Eligibility
(b) . Each Non-Employee Director shall be granted an Option to purchase 4,000 Shares (the "Fixed Grant") (i) on the date of such Non-Employee Director's election or reelection to the Board of Directors and (ii) on the date of each other annual meeting of shareholders as to which such Non-Employee Director is in office and whose term of office as a director is not expiring on such date, in each case, commencing with the 2002 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. In addition to the Fixed Grant, on the same date as the Fixed Grant is made, each Non-Employee Director shall also be granted an additional Option (the "Variable Grant") to purchase a number of Shares such that, when combined with the Fixed Grant, the total number of Shares subject to the two Options shall equal an amount of Shares that will provide the Non-Employee Director with
Annual Fixed and Variable Option Grants
 
dollar-denominated, equity-based compensation equal to the dollar-denominated, equity-based compensation received by non-employee directors in the fiftieth percentile of a comparator group of public companies selected by the Committee (the "Comparator Group") with the assistance of an independent consulting firm expert in such matters (the "Consultant"), and reviewed with the Committee on an annual basis. The method of determining the annual Variable Grant shall be as follows:
1. The Committee, with the assistance of the Consultant, shall first determine the dollar-denominated value of the equity-based compensation received by non-employee directors in the fiftieth percentile of the Comparator Group for the most recent fiscal period for such Group (the "Comparator Equity Value");
2. The Committee shall then divide the Comparator Equity Value by 33% of the Fair Market Value of one Share to determine the aggregate number of Shares covered by Options to be issued to each Non-Employee Director for such period, subject to Section 4(f) above (the "Total Option Shares"); and
3. The Committee shall then subtract the Fixed Grant from the Total Option Shares; the resulting amount shall be the number of Shares subject to the Variable Grant to be made to each Non-Employee Director for such period.
(c) . The exercise price of each Option granted to a Non-Employee Director pursuant to this Section 7 shall be equal to 100 percent of the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of grant. All such Options shall be Non-Qualified Stock Options, shall become exercisable six months after the date of grant, and shall terminate on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant, unless previously exercised or terminated. All such Options shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 6(a) and 10 of the Plan and to other standard terms and conditions contained in the form of Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement used by the Company from time to time.
General Terms of Option Grants
(d) . Non-Qualified Stock Options granted to Non-Employee Directors may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time by serving written notice of exercise on the Company at its principal executive offices, to the attention of the Company's Secretary. The notice shall state the number of Shares as to which the Option is being exercised and be accompanied by payment of the purchase price. A Non-Employee Director may, at such Director's election, pay the purchase price by check payable to the Company, in Shares, or in any combination thereof having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the applicable exercise price.
Exercise of Non-Employee Director Options
(e) . The provisions of this Section 7 may not be amended more often than once every six months other than to comply with changes in the Code or the rules and regulations promulgated under the Code.
Amendments to Section 7
Section 8. .
Amendment and Termination; Adjustments
Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan:

The Board of Directors of the Company may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan; , that, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement, without the approval of the shareholders of the Company, no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made that, absent such approval:
Amendments to the Plan
provided, however
(i) would cause Rule 16b-3 or Section 162(m) of the Code to become unavailable with respect to the Plan;
(ii) would violate the rules or regulations of the NASDAQ National Market, any other securities exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. that are applicable to the Company;
 
(iii) would permit repricing of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights which is prohibited by Section 6(f)(vii); or
(iv) would cause the Company to be unable, under the Code, to grant Incentive Stock Options under the Plan.
(b) . The Committee may waive any conditions of or rights of the Company under any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively. The Committee may not amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively, without the consent of the Participant or holder or beneficiary thereof, except as otherwise herein provided or in the Award Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall not waive any conditions or rights, or otherwise amend or modify any outstanding Award in such a manner as to cause such Award not to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Amendments to Awards
(c) . The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to carry the Plan into effect.
Correction of Defects, Omissions and Inconsistencies
Section 9. Income Tax Withholding; Tax Bonuses.
(a) . In order to comply with all applicable federal or state income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal or state payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of a Participant are withheld or collected from such Participant. In order to assist a Participant in paying all or a portion of the federal and state taxes to be withheld or collected upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) an Award, the Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it may adopt, may permit the Participant to satisfy such tax obligation by (i) electing to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes or (ii) delivering to the Company Shares other than Shares issuable upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes. The election, if any, must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
Withholding
Section 10. General Provisions.
(a) . No Eligible Person, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Persons, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to any Participant or with respect to different Participants.
No Rights to Awards
(b) . The Committee may delegate to one or more officers of the Company or any Affiliate or a committee of such officers the authority, subject to such terms and limitations as the Committee shall determine, to grant Awards to Eligible Persons who are not officers or directors of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.
Delegation
(c) . No Participant will have rights under an Award granted to such Participant unless and until an Award Agreement shall have been duly executed on behalf of the Company and, if requested by the Company, signed by the Participant.
Award Agreements
(d) . Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements
(e) . The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained in the employ of the Company or any Affiliate, nor will it affect in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate such employment at any time, with or without cause. In addition, the
No Right to Employment
 
Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment free from any liability or any claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement. Nothing in this Plan shall confer on any person any legal or equitable right against the Company or any Affiliate, directly or indirectly, or give rise to any cause of action at law or in equity against the Company or an Affiliate. The Awards granted hereunder shall not form any part of the wages or salary of any Eligible Person for purposes of severance pay or termination indemnities, irrespective of the reason for termination of employment. Under no circumstances shall any person ceasing to be an employee of the Company or any Affiliate be entitled to any compensation for any loss of any right or benefit under the Plan which such employee might otherwise have enjoyed but for termination of employment, whether such compensation is claimed by way of damages for wrongful or unfair dismissal, breach of contract or otherwise. By participating in the Plan, each Participant and each Non-Employee Director shall be deemed to have accepted all the conditions of the Plan and the terms and conditions of any rules and regulations adopted by the Committee and shall be fully bound thereby.
(f) . The validity, construction and effect of the Plan or any Award, and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award, shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.
Governing Law
(g) . If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee (or, in the case of grants under Section 7 of the Plan, the Board of Directors), such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee (or, in the case of grants under Section 7 of the Plan, the Board of Directors), materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction or Award, and the remainder of the Plan or any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability
(h) . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.
No Trust or Fund Created
(i) . No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.
No Fractional Shares
(j) . Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
Headings
(k) . No compensation or benefit awarded to or realized by any Participant under the Plan shall be included for the purpose of computing such Participant's compensation under any compensation-based retirement, disability, or similar plan of the Company unless required by law or otherwise provided by such other plan.
Other Benefits
Section 11. Section 16(b) Compliance.
The Plan is intended to comply in all respects with Rule 16b-3 or any successor provision, as in effect from time to time, and in all events the Plan shall be construed in accordance with the requirements of Rule 16b-3. If any Plan provision does not comply with Rule 16b-3 as hereafter amended or interpreted, the provision shall be deemed inoperative. The Board of Directors, in its absolute discretion, may bifurcate the Plan so as to restrict, limit or condition the use of any provision of the Plan to participants who are officers or directors subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act without so restricting, limiting or conditioning the Plan with respect to other participants.
 
Section 12. Effective Date of the Plan.
The Plan, as amended and restated, shall be effective as of June 28, 2006, subject to approval of the Company's shareholders on such date or within one year thereafter.
Section 13. Term of the Plan.
Awards shall only be granted under the Plan during a 10-year period beginning on June 18, 2002, the Plan's original effective date. However, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond the end of such 10-year period, and the authority of the Committee provided for hereunder with respect to the Plan and any Awards, and the authority of the Board to amend the Plan, shall extend beyond the termination of the Plan.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, September 20, 2006
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 20, 2006)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2007 second quarter earnings. Apogee develops and delivers value-added glass products and services for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"We are pleased with our second quarter results, especially in our core architectural segment which achieved significant earnings growth," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "The non-residential construction markets we serve remain strong, as seen in our backlog and bidding activity. We are feeling good about the strength the architectural business is bringing to Apogee's performance this fiscal year.
"The decline in the large-scale optical segment performance compared to the especially strong prior-year period was slightly greater than expected," he said. "Impacting results were an unfavorable framing product mix within value-added glass, along with a softer retail environment and lower pre-framed art sales."

OUTLOOK
"Our strong first-half performance, due to robust commercial construction markets and continued improvement in architectural segment operations, positions us for solid earnings growth in fiscal 2007," said Huffer. "We are maintaining our fiscal 2007 earnings guidance range of $0.88 to $0.94 per share, which includes $0.05 per share for the non-cash expensing of options. This would be strong earnings growth compared to fiscal 2006, which at $0.85 per share included the impact of one-time net tax benefits of $0.07 per share.
"Our strong architectural backlog of $391 million with improving margins gives us confidence in our outlook for the year," he said, adding that approximately $224 million of the backlog is currently scheduled for fiscal 2007.
"Our outlook for the large-scale optical segment has declined slightly," said Huffer. "We are seeing some reduced demand due to softness in national retail accounts, partially offset by increases in picture framing glass sales to distributors. In addition, as certain markets adjust their value-added offerings, it is resulting in a less favorable product mix in fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year.
"We are pleased to have received net proceeds of $1.8 million from a class action lawsuit settlement with a flat glass manufacturer covering 1991 to 1995," he said. "As we indicated last quarter, these proceeds have been included in our current earnings outlook and are somewhat offset by higher health care costs for the year under our self-insured programs."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2007. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

The discussion above, including all statements in the Outlook section, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow; ii) economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully utilize production capacity; and v) construction and ramp-up to full production of the announced third Viracon plant in a timely and cost-efficient manner; (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities; and (C) the auto glass segment: i) transition of markets served as Viracon/Curvlite focuses on selling to aftermarket manufacturers following the end of its long-term supply agreement with PPG Industries in the second quarter of fiscal 2006; ii) changes in market dynamics; iii) market seasonality; iv) highly competitive, fairly mature industry; and v) performance of the PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iii) the costs of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; and v) foreign currency risk related to discontinued operations.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended the Internal Revenue Code to add section 409A ("Section 409A"), which imposes significant restrictions on nonqualified deferred compensation. On October 11, 2006, the Board of Directors of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") approved amendments to the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan, the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan in order to bring such plans into compliance with Section 409A and associated regulations. In addition, the Company's Board of Directors approved an amendment to change the accrual of benefit formula in the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Unless otherwise indicated, the amendments to the plans generally became effective as of January 1, 2005. Descriptions of the plan amendments are set forth below. Such descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the amended plans, copies of which are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.5 and incorporated herein by reference.
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (2005 Restatement) (the "SERP")
The SERP was bifurcated into pre-2005 and post-2004 benefits for each participant in the SERP. The pre-2005 benefits, which is the portion of each participant's benefit that was earned and vested as of December 31, 2004, will continue to be administered in accordance with the laws and SERP rules as they existed prior to the passage of Section 409A, with the understanding that there will be no material modifications to these benefits. The post-2004 benefits, however, are subject to the following changes:
 
 
 
In addition, the SERP will not be terminated and benefits will not be distributed unless such actions are permitted by Section 409A and associated regulations.
First Amendment to Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (2005 Restatement) (the "First Amendment")
The First Amendment changes the accrual of benefits formula under the SERP. The previous formula was 2% multiplied by the participant's Average Monthly Compensation multiplied by years of service. The new formula set forth in the First Amendment is (a) 2% multiplied by the participant's Average Monthly Basic Compensation multiplied by years of service plus (b) 4% multiplied by the participant's Average Monthly Bonus Compensation multiplied by years of service. This change was made to maintain consistent accruals under the SERP following changes made to the Company's bonus programs. The First Amendment became effective as of January 1, 2006.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan (2005 Restatement) (the "Deferred Compensation Plan")
The Deferred Compensation Plan was bifurcated into pre-2005 and post-2004 accounts for each participant. The pre-2005 account, which is the portion of each participant's account that was earned and vested as of December 31, 2004, will continue to be administered in accordance with the laws and Deferred Compensation Plan rules as they existed prior to the passage of Section 409A, with the understanding that there will be no material modifications to these accounts. The post-2004 accounts, however, are subject to the following changes:
 
 
 
 
The Deferred Compensation Plan was also amended to limit the amendments to the plan that can occur after a Change in Control (as defined in the Deferred Compensation Plan) of the Company. In addition, the Deferred Compensation Plan will not be terminated and accounts will not be distributed unless such actions are permitted by Section 409A and associated regulations.
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (2005 Restatement) (the "Non-Employee Director DCP")
The following amendments were made to the Non-Employee Director DCP:
 
 
 
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan (2005 Restatement) (the "Partnership Plan")
As previously disclosed, the Partnership Plan was discontinued for fiscal 2006 and beyond. The Company's executives, however, still have balances in the Partnership Plan. The following amendments were made to the Partnership Plan:

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: October 17, 2006
 
 
 

EXHIBIT 10.1
 
 
 
 
 
APOGEE ENTERPRISES, INC., a Minnesota corporation (the "Principal Sponsor"), and certain affiliated corporations maintain a tax-qualified defined contribution plan known as APOGEE ENTERPRISES, INC. 401(k) RETIREMENT PLAN (also known as the "qualified plan") for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to certain eligible employees. The qualified plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and is intended to qualify as defined contribution plan under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). By operation of section 401(a)(16) of the Code, annual additions to the qualified plan are restricted so that they do not exceed certain maximum annual additions allowed under section 415 of the Code. Further, section 401(a)(17) of the Code restricts the maximum amount of annual compensation which may be taken into account in determining the contributions for any employee under the qualified plan.
Section 3(36) and section 4(b)(5) of ERISA recognize and authorize the establishment of an unfunded, nonqualified plan of deferred compensation maintained by an employer solely for the purpose of providing benefits for employees in excess of the limitations on benefits imposed under section 415 of the Code. Section 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA also recognize the creation of an unfunded plan maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. The Principal Sponsor, pursuant to these provisions of ERISA, previously established and now maintains the APOGEE ENTERPRISES, INC. EXECUTIVE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN (also known as the "restoration plan") for the benefit of certain management or highly compensated employees who are Participants in the qualified plan for the purpose of restoring a portion of the benefits lost due to the application of the 415 and 401(a)(17) limitations imposed on benefits payable under the qualified plan.
It is in the interest of the Employers to provide benefits to certain select officers and management employees in excess of those that can and are being provided under the qualified plan, the restoration plan and other qualified and nonqualified deferred compensation plans as an inducement for them to remain in the service of the Employers. It is also in the interest of the Employers to provide additional benefits to compensate select officers and management employees for qualified and nonqualified retirement benefits that would have been earned but for a mid-career change of employment and to provide an incentive to remain with the Principal Sponsor.
The Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan was adopted by Apogee Enterprises, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, and first effective January 1, 1998, and as amended and restated in this document effective January 1, 2005. However, it is not the intent of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. to in any manner limit any of the grandfathering
provisions found in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1, the proposed regulations or Code Section 409A. This restatement will be administered and construed on a basis consistent with this intent.

Termination of Employment
2.1. . The Participants in the SERP shall be those officers of the Employer who have been expressly designated as Participants by the Board of Directors of the Principal Sponsor in writing.

If any person not so defined has been erroneously treated as a Participant in this Officers' SERP, upon discovery of such error such person's erroneous participation shall immediately terminate and upon demand such person shall be obligated to reimburse the Principal Sponsor for all amounts erroneously paid to him or her.
Overriding Exclusion
ab initio
 
 
3.1.1. . Upon the Termination of Employment of a Participant for reasons other than death:
Entitlement and Amount
 
 
 
the Participant shall be entitled to the supplemental retirement benefit provided for in this Plan Statement.
The monthly amount of the supplemental retirement benefit shall be the amount of the Participant's Accrued SERP Benefit determined as of the Participant's Termination of Employment. However, if the Annuity Starting Date of the supplemental retirement benefit is before (but not more than one hundred twenty months before) the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the Participant would attain Normal Retirement Date, the amount thereof shall be reduced five-ninths of one percent (5/9%) for each of the first sixty (60) months and five-eighteenths of one percent (5/18%) for each of the next sixty (60) months by which the Annuity Starting Date precedes the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the Participant would attain Normal Retirement Date. If the Annuity Starting Date is more than one hundred twenty (120) months before the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the Participant would attain Normal Retirement Date, and

Form of Benefit-When Payable
 
 
 
The Participant may make, rescind and file new elections from time to time and at any time and without the consent of any spouse, Beneficiary or joint annuitant but the election last received by the Principal Sponsor at least one (1) year prior to the Participant's Termination of Employment shall be the only election given effect.
 
 
 
The Participant must make this one time election:
 
 
 
If the Participant has a Termination of Employment in 2006, the Participant's Post 2004 Benefit will be paid in accordance with the default rule stated in Section 3.1.2, regardless of whether the Participant filed an election.
 
3.1.3. . Notwithstanding Section 3.1.2, if payments are to be made on account of Termination of Employment to a Key Employee (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), payment of the Participant's Post 2004 Benefit payable under Section 3.1.2 above shall be suspended until a date that is six (6) months after the date of the Termination of Employment. As soon as administratively feasible after the six (6) month anniversary of the Participant's Termination of Employment, the Participant shall receive all payments, without interest, the Participant would have been entitled to receive during this six month period had the Participant not been a Key Employee. Thereafter, payments shall be made in accordance with Section 3.1.2. above. If a Participant dies prior to receiving a payment under this Section no benefit shall be paid under this Section.
Key Employee
3.1.4. . If the Participant dies prior to receiving a payment in accordance with Section 3.1.3, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the amount of payments, without interest, the Participant would have been entitled to receive prior to the Participant's death had the Participant not been a Key Employee.
Beneficiary of Key Employee
3.1.5. In lieu of the Single Life Annuity form of pension, a Participant may elect as provided above from among the following additional optional forms of pension.
Optional Forms of Pension.
 
 
Annuity Starting Date. The Annuity Starting Date shall be the date specified in Section 3.1.2. The last payment to a Participant shall be due on the first day of the calendar month in which the Participant dies and the last payment to a spouse who survives the Participant shall be due on the first day of the calendar month in which such spouse dies. The value of the amounts payable to the Participant and spouse in the Joint and Survivor Annuity form shall be actuarially equivalent, as determined by the Principal Sponsor, to the amounts payable to the Participant in the Single Life Annuity form.
 
3.1.6. . If any Participant is entitled to receive payment under this Officers' SERP on account of a previous Termination of Employment and is subsequently reemployed by an Employer, such payment shall be discontinued until there is a subsequent Termination of Employment and upon such subsequent Termination of Employment the Participant's benefit shall be adjusted for the benefits previously received.
Suspension Upon Reemployment
 
3.2.1. . Upon the death of a Participant who died:
When Available
 
 
 
a monthly survivor annuity shall be payable to the surviving spouse to whom the Participant was married for at least one (1) year ending on the date of death.
3.2.2. . The amount of the monthly survivor annuity shall be the amount which the surviving spouse would have received if the Participant:
Amount
 
 
 
 
3.2.3. . The first payment of this monthly survivor annuity shall be due on the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the Participant dies. The last payment of this monthly survivor annuity shall be due to the surviving spouse on the first day of the calendar month in which the surviving spouse dies. Any election, rescission or other action taken by the Participant shall have no effect on the monthly survivor annuity payable under this section. No other death benefit shall be payable with respect to a Participant who dies before his or her Annuity Starting Date.
Form of Benefit-When Payable
3.3. . The only death benefits which shall be payable under the Plan upon the death of a Participant after his or her Annuity Starting Date shall be the unpaid installments of annuity, if any, which are to be continued under the form of pension which the Participant has elected.
Survivor Benefit  Death After Annuity Starting Date
 
3.4.1. . This Section shall apply to the payment of unpaid installments of annuity, if any, which are to be continued under the Term Certain and Life Annuity after the death of the Participant and shall not apply to the payment of any benefits pursuant to any Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. In addition, this Section shall apply to the payment of any amount due the Beneficiary of a Key Employee pursuant to Section 3.1.4.
Scope
3.4.2. . Each Participant may designate, upon forms to be furnished by and filed with the Principal Sponsor, one or more primary Beneficiaries or alternative Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of the unpaid installments of annuity, if any, in the event of the Participant's death. The Participant may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent from any Beneficiary, designated joint annuitant or spouse. No such designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless executed by the Participant and received by the Principal Sponsor during the Participant's lifetime.
Right To Designate Beneficiaries
3.4.3. . If a Participant:
Failure of Designation
 
 
 
 
the unpaid installments of annuity, if any, or the part thereof as to which such Participant's designation fails, as the case may be, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries with a member surviving the Participant and (except in the case of the Participant's surviving issue) in equal shares if there is more than one member in such class surviving the Participant:
Participant's surviving spouse
Participant's surviving issue per stirpes and not per capita
Participant's surviving parents
Participant's surviving brothers and sisters
Representative of Participant's estate.
3.4.4. . A Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of unpaid installments of annuity, if any, may disclaim his or her interest therein subject to the following requirements. To be eligible to disclaim, a Beneficiary must be a natural person, must not have received a distribution of all or any portion of a benefit at the time such disclaimer is executed and delivered, and must have attained at least age twenty-one (21) years as of the date of the Participant's death. Any disclaimer must be in writing and must be executed personally by the Beneficiary before a notary public. A disclaimer shall state that the Beneficiary's entire interest in the undistributed benefit is disclaimed or shall specify what portion thereof is disclaimed. To be effective, an original executed copy of the disclaimer must be executed and actually delivered to the Principal Sponsor after the date of the Participant's death but not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Participant's death. A disclaimer shall be irrevocable when delivered to the Principal Sponsor. A disclaimer shall be considered to be delivered to the Principal Sponsor only when actually received by an officer or other senior management employee of the Principal Sponsor who is familiar with and involved in the administration of this Officers' SERP. The Principal Sponsor shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported disclaimer. Upon the filing of a valid disclaimer, the Beneficiary shall be considered not to have survived the Participant as to the interest disclaimed. A disclaimer by a Beneficiary shall not be considered to be a transfer of an interest in violation of the provisions of Section 5.4 and shall not be considered to be an assignment or alienation of benefits in violation of federal law prohibiting the assignment or alienation of benefits under this Plan. No other form of attempted disclaimer shall be recognized by the Principal Sponsor.
Disclaimers by Beneficiaries
3.4.5. . When used herein and, unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, when used in a Beneficiary designation, "issue" means all persons who are lineal descendants of the person whose issue are referred to, including legally adopted descendants and their descendants but not including illegitimate descendants and their descendants; "child" means an issue of the first generation; "per stirpes" means in equal shares among living children of the person whose issue are referred to and the issue (taken collectively) of each deceased child of such person, with such issue taking by right of representation of such deceased child; and "survive" and "surviving" mean living after the death of the Participant.
Definitions
3.4.6. . Unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, the following rules shall apply:
Special Rules
 
 
 
 
 
A Beneficiary designation is permanently void if it either is executed or is filed by a Participant who, at the time of such execution or filing, is then a minor under the law of the state of the Participant's legal residence. The Principal Sponsor shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported Beneficiary designation.
3.5. . In case of legal incompetency (including minority) of a person entitled to receive any payment under this Officers' SERP, payment may be made, if the Principal Sponsor has been advised of the existence of such condition:
Payment in Case of Incompetency or Disability
 
 
 
Any payment made in accordance with this Section shall constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of this Officers' SERP and the Principal Sponsor and all Employers therefor.
4.1. . The obligation of the Principal Sponsor to make payments under this Officers' SERP constitutes only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Principal Sponsor to make such payments. The Participant shall have no lien, prior claim or other security interest in any property of any Principal Sponsor. If a fund (including, for example, a rabbi trust) is established by the Principal Sponsor in connection with this Officers' SERP, the property therein shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Principal Sponsor. Except to the extent the Principal Sponsor in its discretion may establish and pay benefits from such a fund (including, for example, a rabbi trust), the Principal Sponsor will pay the cost of this Officers' SERP out of its general assets.
Unfunded Obligation
4.2. . If the Principal Sponsor elects to finance all or a portion of its costs in connection with this Officers' SERP through the purchase of life insurance or other investments, the Participant agrees, as a condition of participation in this Officers' SERP, to cooperate with the Principal Sponsor in the purchase of such investment to any extent reasonably required by the Principal Sponsor and relinquishes any claim he or she may have either for himself or herself or any beneficiary to the proceeds of any such investment or any other rights or interests in such investment. If a Participant fails or refuses to cooperate, then notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan Statement (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Section 4) the Principal Sponsor shall immediately and irrevocably terminate and forfeit the Participant's entitlement to benefits under this Officers' SERP.
Hedging Investments
4.3. . Neither the Principal Sponsor's officers nor any member of its Board of Directors in any way secures or guarantees the payment of any benefit or amount which may become due and payable hereunder to or with respect to any Participant. Each Participant and other person entitled at any time to payments hereunder shall look solely to the assets of the Principal Sponsor for such payments as an unsecured, general creditor. After benefits shall have been paid to or with respect to a Participant and such payment purports to cover in full the benefit hereunder, such former Participant or other person or persons, as the case may be, shall have no further right or interest in the other assets of the Principal Sponsor in connection with this Officers' SERP. Neither the Principal Sponsor nor any of its officers nor any member of its Boards of Directors shall be under any liability or responsibility for failure to effect any of the objectives or purposes of this Officers' SERP by reason of the insolvency of the Principal Sponsor.
Consensual Creditor
 
 
5.1.1. . Prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Board of Directors of the Principal Sponsor may unilaterally amend the Plan Statement prospectively, retroactively or both, at any time and for any reason deemed sufficient by it without notice to any person affected by this Officers' SERP and may likewise terminate this Officers' SERP both with regard to persons expecting to receive benefits in the future; provided, however, that:
Before a Change in Control
 
 
5.1.2. .
After a Change in Control
 
 
 
 
 
5.1.3. . No modification of the terms of the Plan Statement or termination of the Officers' SERP shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed on behalf of the Principal Sponsor by a person authorized to execute such writing. No oral representation concerning the interpretation or effect of the Plan Statement shall be effective to amend the Plan Statement.
No Oral Amendments
5.1.4. . The Principal Sponsor will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Principal Sponsor), by agreement, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Officers' SERP in the same manner and to the same extent that the Principal Sponsor would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
Plan Binding on Successors
5.1.5. . Following a termination of the Plan, Accrued SERP Benefits shall remain in the Plan until the Participant becomes eligible for the benefits provided in Section 3. The termination of the Plan shall not adversely affect any Participant or Beneficiary who has become entitled to the payment of any benefits under the Plan as of the date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permissible under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and related Treasury regulations and guidance, if there is a termination of the Plan with respect to all Participants, the Compensation Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and notwithstanding any elections made by the Participant, to immediately pay all benefits in a lump sum following such termination of the Plan.
Termination
 
5.3. . In the absence of any designation to the contrary by the Principal Sponsor, the Secretary of the Principal Sponsor is designated as the appropriate and exclusive agent for the receipt of service of process directed to this Officers' SERP in any legal proceeding, including arbitration, involving this Officers' SERP.
Service of Process
5.4. . No Participant, surviving spouse, joint or contingent annuitant or beneficiary shall have the power to transmit, assign, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber any benefit payable under this Officers' SERP before its actual payment to such person. The Principal Sponsor shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under this Officers' SERP. No benefit payable under this Officers' SERP shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution following judgment or other legal process before actual payment to such person.
Spendthrift Provision
5.5. . The Principal Sponsor shall make such determinations as may be required from time to time in the administration of this Officers' SERP. The Principal Sponsor shall have the discretionary authority and responsibility to interpret and construe the Plan Statement and to determine all factual and legal questions under this Officers' SERP, including but not limited to the entitlement of Participants and others, and
Administrative Determinations
 
the amounts of their respective interests. Each interested party may act and rely upon all information reported to them hereunder and need not inquire into the accuracy thereof, nor be charged with any notice to the contrary.
5.6. . Any rule not in conflict or at variance with the provisions hereof may be adopted by the Principal Sponsor.
Rules and Regulations
5.7. .

Certifications
5.8. . The Principal Sponsor shall not be liable or responsible for any error in the computation of any benefit payable to or with respect to any Participant resulting from any misstatement of fact made by the Participant or by or on behalf of any survivor to whom such benefit shall be payable, directly or indirectly, to the Principal Sponsor, and used by the Principal Sponsor in determining the benefit. The Principal Sponsor shall not be obligated or required to increase the benefit payable to or with respect to such Participant which, on discovery of the misstatement, is found to be understated as a result of such misstatement of the Participant. However, the benefit of any Participant which is overstated by reason of any such misstatement or any other reason shall be reduced to the amount appropriate in view of the truth (and to recover any prior overpayment by offset or other legal process).
Errors in Computations
All unpaid benefits under this Officers' SERP, shall be permanently forfeited upon the determination by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Principal Sponsor that the Participant, either before or after Termination of Employment:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Without limiting the generality of the following, an application for benefits under Section 3 and any objection to a forfeiture under Section 6 shall be processed as a claim for the purposes of this section.
7.1. . Any person may file with the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Principal Sponsor a written claim for benefits under this Officers' SERP. Within ninety (90) days after the filing of such a claim, the Compensation Committee shall notify the claimant in writing whether his or her claim is upheld or denied in whole or in part or shall furnish the claimant a written notice describing specific special circumstances requiring a specified amount of additional time (but not more than one hundred eighty days from the date the claim was filed) to reach a decision on the claim. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Compensation Committee shall state in writing:
Original Claim
 
 
 
 
7.2. . Within sixty (60) days after receipt of notice that his or her claim has been denied in whole or in part, the claimant may file with the Compensation Committee a written request for a review and may, in conjunction therewith, submit written issues and comments. Within sixty (60) days after the filing of such a request for review, the Compensation Committee shall notify the claimant in writing whether, upon review, the claim was upheld or denied in whole or in part or shall furnish the claimant a written notice describing specific special circumstances requiring a specified amount of additional time (but not more than one hundred twenty days from the date the request for review was filed) to reach a decision on the request for review.
Claims Review Procedure
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.1. . This SERP is adopted with the understanding that it is an unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees as provided in section 201(2), section 301(3) and section 401(a)(1) of ERISA. Each provision shall be interpreted and administered accordingly.
ERISA Status
8.2. . This SERP is intended to be a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement. The rules of section 401(a) of the Code shall not apply to this Officers' SERP. The rules of section 3121(v) and section 3306(r)(2) of the Code shall apply to this Officers' SERP. Apogee has affirmatively determined that all amounts deferred under the Plan that were earned and vested before January 1, 2005, shall not be subject to section 409A of the Code (i.e., will be "grandfathered" under the law as it existed before section 409A of the Code) and this Plan Statement shall be construed and administered accordingly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Apogee nor any of its officers, directors, agents or affiliates shall be obligated, directly or indirectly, to any Participant or any other person for any taxes, penalties, interest or like amounts that may be imposed on the Participant or other person on account of any amounts under this Plan or on account of any failure to comply with any Code section.
IRC Status
et. seq.
8.3. . This SERP shall not alter, enlarge or diminish any person's employment rights or obligations or rights or obligations under the Defined Contribution Plans or any other plan. It is specifically contemplated that the Defined Contribution Plans will, from time to time, be amended and possibly terminated. All such amendments and termination shall be given effect under this Officers' SERP (it being expressly intended that this Officers' SERP
Effect on Other Plans
 
shall not lock in the benefit structures of the Defined Contribution Plans or any other plan as they exist at the adoption of this Officers' SERP or upon the commencement of participation, or commencement of benefits by any Participant).
8.4. . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan Statement or any election or designation made under this Officers' SERP, any individual who feloniously and intentionally kills a Participant shall be deemed for all purposes of this Officers' SERP and all elections and designations made under this Officers' SERP to have died before such Participant. A final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing is conclusive for this purpose. In the absence of a conviction of felonious and intentional killing, the Principal Sponsor shall determine whether the killing was felonious and intentional for this purpose.
Disqualification
8.5. . Whenever appropriate, words used herein in the singular may be read in the plural, or words used herein in the plural may be read in the singular; the masculine may include the feminine; and the words "hereof," "herein" or "hereunder" or other similar compounds of the word "here" shall mean and refer to the entire Plan Statement and not to any particular paragraph or Section of the Plan Statement unless the context clearly indicates to the contrary. The titles given to the various Sections of the Plan Statement are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not part of the Plan Statement, and they shall not be considered in determining the purpose, meaning or intent of any provision hereof. Notwithstanding any thing apparently to the contrary contained in the Plan Statement, the Plan Statement shall be construed and administered to prevent the duplication of benefits provided under this Officers' SERP and any other qualified or nonqualified plan maintained in whole or in part by the Principal Sponsor.
Rules of Document Construction
8.6. . Any reference in the Plan Statement to a statute or regulation shall be considered also to mean and refer to any subsequent amendment or replacement of that statute or regulation.
References to Laws
8.7. . Neither the terms of the Plan Statement nor the benefits under this Officers' SERP nor the continuance thereof shall be a term of the employment of any employee. The Principal Sponsor shall not be obliged to continue this Officers' SERP. The terms of this Officers' SERP shall not give any employee the right to be retained in the employment of any Employer.
Effect on Employment
 
8.8. . This instrument has been executed and delivered in the State of Minnesota and has been drawn in conformity to the laws of that State and shall, except to the extent that federal law is controlling, be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.

EXHIBIT 10.3
 
 
 
 
1.1. . Effective February 27, 1986, Apogee Enterprises, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "Apogee") and certain affiliated corporations (together with Apogee hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the "Employers" and separately as the "Employer") created a nonqualified, unfunded, elective deferral plan for the purpose of allowing a select group of management and highly compensated employees of the Employers to defer the receipt of incentive compensation which would otherwise be paid to those employees. Apogee reserved to itself, by action of the Compensation Committee of its Board of Directors, to amend that Plan and has done so on prior occasions. By the adoption of this 2005 Restatement, Apogee does hereby completely amend and restate the terms of the Plan in this Plan Statement.
Amendment and Restatement
1.2. . The obligation of the Employers to make payments under this Plan constitutes only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Employers to make such payments. No Participant shall have any lien, prior claim or other security interest in any property of the Employers. The Employers shall have no obligation to establish or maintain any fund, trust or account (other than a bookkeeping account or reserve) for the purpose of funding or paying the benefits promised under this Plan. If such a fund, trust or account is established, the property therein shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Employer that established it. The Employers shall be obligated to pay the benefits of this Plan out of their general assets.
Unfunded Obligation
1.3. . When the following terms are used herein with initial capital letters, they shall have the following meanings:
Definitions
1.3.1.  a business entity which is affiliated in ownership with Apogee that is recognized as an Affiliate by the Plan Administrator for the purposes of this Plan.
Affiliate
1.3.2.  the Compensation Committee of the Apogee Board of Directors.
Committee
1.3.3.  the account of a Participant under the Plan as provided in Section 3.1.
Deferred Compensation Account
1.3.4.  mental or physical disability which, in the opinion of the Committee, based on medical evidence satisfactory to the Committee, prevents a Participant from engaging in the principal duties of his or her employment.
Disability
1.3.5.  an immediate, severe financial need of a Participant, resulting from an event not reasonably foreseeable by the Participant, which cannot be met by the Participant from other resources reasonably available to the Participant from insurance or reimbursement, liquidation of assets to the extent that would not itself cause severe financial hardship or cessation of deferrals under the Plan. Such events would arise, for example, from a serious illness, injury or accident of the Participant or a dependent member of Participant's family, loss of property due to casualty or similar severe, extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of Participant detrimentally affecting the health or welfare of the Participant or a dependent member of Participant's family. The Committee shall determine when Financial Hardship occurs and its determination shall be final and not subject to review or challenge by a Participant. However, when the term "Financial Hardship" is used in the Plan Statement in connection with the Post 2004 Account, it shall be construed to have the same meaning consistent with the term "Unforeseeable Emergency" as used in section 409A of the Code.
Financial Hardship
1.3.6.  the annual period ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of February or such fiscal year of Apogee as it may be changed hereafter from time to time.
Fiscal Year
1.3.7.  the incentive compensation arrangement of Apogee as adopted on a year to year basis, prior to the end of a Fiscal Year, and as revised from time to time, which provides for incentive compensation to selected management employees of Apogee or its Subsidiaries on the attainment of defined financial goals during the course of a Fiscal Year, if said employee remains in the employ of Apogee or its Subsidiaries at the end of that Fiscal Year.
Incentive Plan
1.3.8.  a person employed by Apogee or its Subsidiaries who is a participant in and eligible to receive compensation under the Incentive Plan and who has elected to defer such compensation under this Plan, or a person who, prior to the time of Retirement, death, Disability, or Termination of Employment, had elected to defer such compensation under this Plan and who retains, or whose beneficiaries retain, benefits under the Plan and in accordance with its terms.
Participant
1.3.9.  this Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan, as it may be amended from time to time.
Plan
1.3.10.  the Deferred Compensation Account excluding the Pre 2005 Account, if any.
Post 2004 Account
1.3.11.  the Deferred Compensation Account that was both accrued and vested before January 1, 2005, under the terms of the Plan as of December 31, 2004, if any.
Pre 2005 Benefit
1.3.12.  a Participant's retirement at or after attaining age 65.
Retirement
1.3.13.  a corporation, of which Apogee owns at least fifty percent (50%) of the shares having voting power in the election of directors.
Subsidiary
1.3.14.  a Participant's termination of employment with Apogee or its Subsidiaries, whether voluntary or involuntary. However, when the term
Termination of Employment
 
"Termination of Employment" is used in the Plan Statement in connection with Post 2004 Account, it shall be construed to have the same meaning consistent with the term "Separation from Service" as used in section 409A of the Code.
2.1. .
Participation
2.1.1. .
Participation by Affirmative Selection
 
 
 
 
2.1.2. . For any Fiscal Year, any Participant may elect to defer all or any portion of the compensation that may become payable to the Participant under the Incentive Plan. The election shall be made in writing on the form set forth in Exhibit A, designating the percentage or amount of the compensation that may be due under the Incentive Plan which is to be deferred, signed by the participant and delivered to the Director of Compensation prior to the commencement of the Fiscal Year with respect to which the compensation is to be earned and deferred. If an individual is employed by Apogee during the Fiscal Year and is to be eligible for compensation under the Incentive Plan, that individual shall make the election to defer prior to the first day of employment. The election to defer under the Plan, once made, is irrevocable.
Election of Participants
2.2. . Notwithstanding anything apparently to the contrary in the Plan Statement or in any written communication, summary, resolution or document or oral communication, no individual shall be a Participant in this Plan, develop benefits under this Plan or be entitled to receive benefits under this Plan (either for himself or herself or his or her survivors)
Specific Exclusion
 
unless such individual is a member of a select group of management or highly compensated employees (as that expression is used in ERISA). If a court of competent jurisdiction, any representative of the U.S. Department of Labor or any other governmental, regulatory or similar body makes any direct or indirect, formal or informal, determination that an individual is not a member of a select group of management or highly compensated employees (as that expression is used in ERISA), such individual shall not be (and shall not have ever been) a Participant in this Plan at any time. If any person not so defined has been erroneously treated as a Participant in this Plan, upon discovery of such error such person's erroneous participation shall immediately terminate and the individual's Account shall be forfeited immediately and such person shall be obligated to reimburse the Employers for all amounts erroneously paid to him or her.
ab initio
3.1. . Following the close of the Fiscal Year end, and as soon thereafter as may be reasonably practicable, Apogee shall determine the amount of compensation due a Participant, if any, under the Incentive Plan and the portion deferred by a Participant shall then be credited to a general ledger account. A separate account, the Deferred Compensation Account, shall be kept in the name of each Participant and each beneficiary of a deceased Participant.
Crediting the Account
3.2. The balance of each Participant's Deferred Compensation Account shall be credited as a book entry with interest, compounded quarter-annually, on the last day of each quarter of each Fiscal Year, or pro-rata for such lesser period as may occur in the event that the Deferred Compensation Account is credited with deferred compensation or reduced by a distribution from the Deferred Compensation Account on a day other than the last day of a Fiscal Year quarter. The applicable interest rate in any Fiscal Year shall be determined as of the beginning of each Fiscal Year and shall be the greater of the following rates:
Earnings on the Account.
 
 
3.3. . Subject to Section 5, Apogee shall have the right, but not the obligation to segregate funds which represent sums which accrue in the Deferred Compensation Account, and, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to hold such funds in cash or invest or reinvest the same in any manner it deems desirable.
Administration of the Account
 
4.1. . Distribution of the amount accrued on behalf of a Participant in a Deferred Compensation Account shall be made in a lump sum upon a date determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, but not later than ninety (90) days from the date of the first to occur of the following events:
Events of Distribution
 
 
 
 
 
4.2. . Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1, following the occurrence of an event described in Section 4.1, except Financial Hardship, a distribution may be made in such other manner as a Participant elects on the form attached hereto as Exhibit A executed and delivered to the Committee at the time the Participant makes his or her first election to defer compensation under the Plan. Except with respect to the Post 2004 Account, if a Participant elects distribution in a form other than lump sum, the Committee, notwithstanding such election, shall have the right in its sole discretion to vary the manner and time of making installment distributions, in a lump sum or over a shorter or longer period of time as it may find appropriate. In the event of Financial Hardship, the distribution shall not exceed the amount determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to meet the immediate need of the Participant on account of the Financial Hardship.
Alternative Distribution Methods
4.3. . In the event of installment distribution, each monthly installment shall be paid on the first day of each calendar month in an amount equal to the balance credited to the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account on the date in which the first monthly distribution is to be made, divided by the number of months for which the distribution is to be made. However, following the close of the first Fiscal Year immediately succeeding the first month of distribution, and for each Fiscal Year thereafter until the Deferred Compensation Account is reduced to zero, an additional amount shall be paid monthly to the Participant equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of the earnings on the Participant's Deferred Compensation Account for the prior Fiscal Year or any portion thereof, as determined under Section 3.2.
Installment Distributions
4.4. . Notwithstanding Section 4.1, if payments are to be made on account of Termination of Employment to a Key Employee (as defined in section 409A of the Code), payment
Key Employee
 
of the Participant's Post 2004 Account payable under Section 4.1 above shall be suspended until a date that is six (6) months after the date of the Termination of Employment. As soon as administratively feasible after the six (6) month anniversary of the Participant's Termination of Employment, the Participant shall receive all payments, without interest, the Participant would have been entitled to receive during this six month period had the Participant not been a Key Employee. Thereafter, payments shall be made in accordance with Section 4.1 above. If a Participant dies prior to receiving a payment under this Section no benefit shall be paid under this Section.
4.5. . In the Participant dies prior to receiving a payment in accordance with Section 4.4, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the amount of payments, without interest, the Participant would have been entitled to receive prior to the Participant's death had the Participant not been a Key Employee.
Beneficiary of Key Employee
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to create a trust of any kind or create any fiduciary relationship. If funds related to a Deferred Compensation Account are segregated or invested, they shall be and continue to be a part of the general assets of Apogee, subject to the claims of its general creditors. No person, other than Participant (or the Participant's beneficiaries in the event of death) shall have any claim against Apogee by virtue of the provisions of this Plan. The rights of Participant (or the Participant's beneficiaries in the event of death) to receive payments from Apogee under this Plan are and shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of Apogee.
6.1. . Each Participant may designate, upon forms to be furnished by and filed with the Plan Administrator, one or more primary Beneficiaries or alternative Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of such Participant's Account in the event of such Participant's death. The Participant may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent from any Beneficiary. No such designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless executed by the Participant and received by the Plan Administrator during the Participant's lifetime.
Right to Designate
6.2. . If a Participant:
Failure of Designation
 
 
 
such Participant's Account, or the part thereof as to which such Participant's designation fails, as the case may be, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries with a member surviving the Participant and (except in the case of surviving issue) in equal shares if there is more than one member in such class surviving the Participant:
Participant's surviving spouse
Participant's surviving issue per stirpes and not per capita
Participant's surviving parents
Participant's surviving brothers and sisters
Representative of Participant's estate.
6.3. . A Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of a deceased Participant's Account may disclaim an interest therein subject to the following requirements. To be eligible to disclaim, a Beneficiary must be a natural person, must not have received a distribution of all or any portion of the Account at the time such disclaimer is executed and delivered, and must have attained at least age twenty-one (21) years as of the date of the Participant's death. Any disclaimer must be in writing and must be executed personally by the Beneficiary before a notary public. A disclaimer shall state that the Beneficiary's entire interest in the undistributed Account is disclaimed or shall specify what portion thereof is disclaimed. To be effective, duplicate original executed copies of the disclaimer must be both executed and actually delivered to the Plan Administrator after the date of the Participant's death but not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Participant's death. A disclaimer shall be irrevocable when delivered to the Plan Administrator. A disclaimer shall be considered to be delivered to the Plan Administrator only when actually received by the Plan Administrator. The Plan Administrator shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported disclaimer. Upon the filing of a valid disclaimer, the Beneficiary shall be considered not to have survived the Participant as to the interest disclaimed. A disclaimer by a Beneficiary shall not be considered to be a transfer of an interest in violation of the provisions of Section 5 and shall not be considered to be an assignment or alienation of benefits in violation of federal law prohibiting the assignment or alienation of benefits under this Plan. No other form of attempted disclaimer shall be recognized by the Plan Administrator.
Disclaimers by Beneficiaries
6.4. . When used herein and, unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, when used in a Beneficiary designation, "issue" means all persons who are lineal descendants of the person whose issue are referred to, including legally adopted descendants and their descendants but not including illegitimate descendants and their descendants; "child" means an issue of the first generation; "per stirpes" means in equal shares among living children of the person whose issue are referred to and the issue (taken collectively) of each deceased child of such person, with such issue taking by right of representation of such deceased child; and "survive" and "surviving" mean living after the death of the Participant.
Definitions
6.5. . Unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, the following rules shall apply:
Special Rules
 
 
 
 
 
A Beneficiary designation is permanently void if it either is executed or is filed by a Participant who, at the time of such execution or filing, is then a minor under the law of the state of the Participant's legal residence. The Plan Administrator shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported Beneficiary designation.
6.6. . Prior to the death of the Participant, no spouse or surviving spouse of a Participant and no person designated to be a Beneficiary shall have any rights or interest in the benefits credited under this Plan including, but not limited to, the right to be the sole Beneficiary or to consent to the designation of Beneficiaries (or the changing of designated Beneficiaries) by the Participant.
No Spousal Rights
6.7. . If, at the death of the Participant, any payment to the Participant was due or otherwise pending but not actually paid, the amount of such payment shall be included in the Account which are payable to the Beneficiary (and shall not be paid to the Participant's estate).
Death Prior to Full Distribution
 
6.8. . In case of the legal disability, including minority, of a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to receive any distribution under this Plan, payment shall be made, if the Plan Administrator shall be advised of the existence of such condition:
Facility of Payment
 
 
Any payment made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section shall constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of the Plan Administrator therefor.
7.1. .
Amendment and Termination
7.1.1. . Prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Committee may unilaterally amend the Plan Statement prospectively, retroactively or both, at any time and for any reason deemed sufficient by it without notice to any person affected by this Plan and may likewise terminate this Plan both with regard to persons expecting to receive benefits in the future; provided, however, that:
Before a Change in Control
 
 
7.1.2. .
After a Change in Control
 
 
 
 
7.1.3. . No modification of the terms of the Plan Statement or termination of the Plan shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed on behalf of the Committee by a person authorized to execute such writing. No oral representation concerning the interpretation or effect of the Plan Statement shall be effective to amend the Plan Statement.
No Oral Amendments
7.1.4. . No amendment may be made to Section 5 of the Plan Statement.
No Amendment to Section 5

Each provision shall be interpreted and administered accordingly.
ERISA Status

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Apogee nor any of its officers, directors, agents or affiliates shall be obligated, directly or indirectly, to any Participant or any other person for any taxes, penalties, interest or like amounts that may be imposed on the Participant or other person on account of any amounts under this Plan or on account of any failure to comply with any Code section.

A final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing is conclusive for this purpose. In the absence of a conviction of felonious and intentional killing, Apogee shall determine whether the killing was felonious and intentional for this purpose.
Disqualification
9.4. . Whenever appropriate, words used herein in the singular may be read in the plural, or words used herein in the plural may be read in the singular; the masculine may include the feminine; and the words "hereof," "herein" or "hereunder" or other

The titles given to the various Sections of the Plan Statement are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not part of the Plan Statement, and they shall not be considered in determining the purpose, meaning or intent of any provision hereof. Notwithstanding any thing apparently to the contrary contained in the Plan Statement, the Plan Statement shall be construed and administered to prevent the duplication of benefits provided under this Plan and any other qualified or nonqualified plan maintained in whole or in part by Apogee.
9.5. . Any reference in the Plan Statement to a statute or regulation shall be considered also to mean and refer to any subsequent amendment or replacement of that statute or regulation.
References to Laws
9.6. . Neither the terms of the Plan Statement nor the benefits under this Plan nor the continuance thereof shall be a term of the employment of any employee. Apogee shall not be obliged to continue this Plan. The terms of this Plan shall not give any employee the right to be retained in the employment of any employer.
Effect on Employment
9.7. . This instrument has been executed and delivered in the State of Minnesota and has been drawn in conformity to the laws of that State and shall, except to the extent that federal law is controlling, be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.

Not an Employment Contract
9.10. . The Employers (or any other person legally obligated to do so) shall withhold the amount of any federal, state or local income tax, payroll tax or other tax required to be withheld under applicable law with respect to any amount payable under this Plan. All benefits otherwise due hereunder shall be reduced by the amount to be withheld.
Tax Withholding
9.11. . All expenses of administering the benefits due under this Plan shall be borne by the Employers.
Expenses
9.12. . No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any Account which can be transferred nor shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any power to anticipate, alienate, dispose of, pledge or encumber the same while in the possession or control of the Employers. The Plan Administrator shall not recognize any such effort to convey any interest under this Plan. No benefit payable under this Plan shall be subject to attachment, garnishment, execution following judgment or other legal process before actual payment to such person.
Spendthrift Provision
 
The power to designate Beneficiaries to receive the Account of a Participant in the event of such Participant's death shall not permit or be construed to permit such power or right to be exercised by the Participant so as thereby to anticipate, pledge, mortgage or encumber such Participant's Account or any part thereof, and any attempt of a Participant so to exercise said power in violation of this provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be disregarded by the Employers.
This section shall not prevent the Plan Administrator from exercising, in its discretion, any of the applicable powers and options granted to it upon the occurrence of a Separation From Service, as such powers may be conferred upon it by any applicable provision hereof.
9.13. .

The Plan Administrator shall not be liable or responsible for any error in the computation of any benefit payable to or with respect to any Participant resulting from any misstatement of fact made by the Participant or by or on behalf of any survivor to whom such benefit shall be payable, directly or indirectly, to the Plan Administrator, and used by the Plan Administrator in determining the benefit. The Plan Administrator shall not be obligated or required to increase the benefit payable to or with respect to such Participant which, on discovery of the misstatement, is found to be understated as a result of such misstatement of the Participant. However, the benefit of any Participant which is overstated by reason of any such misstatement or any other reason shall be reduced to the amount appropriate in view of the truth (and to recover any prior overpayment).

This will be accomplished by allowing each Participating Director to elect voluntarily to receive all or a portion of his or her retainer and fees in the form of shares of deferred Common Stock pursuant to an irrevocable election made under this Plan.

having a Fair Market Value, as defined in Section 4.5, equal to the amount of the Retainer and Fees so elected for deferral for the applicable quarter plus the Incentive Amount. Amounts credited to the Deferred Stock Accounts shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth share.

4.3. . A Participating Director may elect to defer payment of the Retainer and payment of Fees pursuant to this Plan by filing, at any time prior to the beginning of a Plan Year (or by such earlier date as the Administrative Committee shall determine), an irrevocable election with the Company on a form provided for that purpose, except that any person who is first elected to the Board after the beginning of a Plan Year may make a Stock Deferral Election for that Plan Year within thirty (30) days of becoming eligible to participate in this Plan. The Deferral Election Form shall specify an amount to be deferred expressed as a percentage of the Participating Director's Retainer and Fees.

4.4. . Each time a cash dividend is paid on the Common Stock of the Company, the Participating Director shall receive a credit of stock units to Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account as of the last business day of the calendar quarter in which the dividend was paid.

4.5. . For purposes of converting dollar amounts into shares of Common Stock, the Fair Market Value of each share of Common Stock shall be equal to the closing price of one share of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market (or other exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are then listed and primarily traded) on the applicable crediting date or payment date.
Fair Market Value
4.6. . If a Participating Director leaves the Board before the conclusion of any calendar quarter, the Participating Director will be paid the quarterly installment of the Retainer and Fees entirely in cash, notwithstanding that a Stock Deferral Election made by such Participating Director is on file with the Company.

At the time of making the Stock Deferral Election, each Participating Director shall also complete a deferral payment election specifying one of the payment options described in Sections 6.3 and 6.4, and an election pursuant to Section 6.1 for the Maturity Date. The deferral payment election shall be irrevocable as to all amounts credited to the Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account. The Participating Director may change the deferral payment election by completing a Deferred Payment Form and filing it with the Company, such change will only apply to deferrals credited in a subsequent Plan Year.
Form of Deferral Payment

Unless a Participating Director elects to receive payment of the Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account in installments as described in Section 6.4, credits to a Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account shall be payable in full on the first business day of the calendar year following the Maturity Date.

Payment of Deferred Stock Accounts in a Lump Sum
 
in all cases, be made in a lump sum in accordance with this Section and not Section 6.4 of this Plan. All payments shall be made in shares of Common Stock, with one share of Common Stock issued for each stock unit credited to the Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account, plus cash in lieu of any fractional share.
6.4. . A Participating Director may elect to have the Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account paid in annual installments following the Maturity Date.

All installment payments shall be made annually beginning on the first business day of the calendar year following the Maturity Date, with subsequent installments paid on the first business day of each subsequent calendar year. The amount of each installment payment shall be computed as the number of stock units credited to the Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account on the relevant installment payment date, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which is the total number of installments elected (not to exceed 10) minus the number of installments previously paid. Amounts paid prior to the final installment payment shall be rounded to the nearest whole number of shares; the final installment payment shall be for the whole number of stock units then credited to the Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account, together with cash in lieu of any fractional share.
Payment of Deferred Stock Accounts in Installments
6.5. . Notwithstanding Sections 6.3 and 6.4, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in Section 12), credits to a Participating Director's Deferred Stock Account immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction constituting the Change of Control shall be paid in full to the Participating Director or the Participating Director's beneficiary or estate, as the case may be, either in whole shares of Common Stock (together with cash in lieu of a fractional share) or, if the holders of Common Stock generally are to receive other consideration in such Change of Control transaction, in the consideration per share of Common Stock to be received by such holders of Common Stock, in either case, on the business day immediately after the effective date of the transaction.

Each Participant may designate, upon forms to be furnished by and filed with the Plan Administrator, one or more primary Beneficiaries or alternative Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of such Participant's Deferred Stock Account in the event of such Participant's death. The Participant may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent from any Beneficiary. No such designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless executed by the Participant and received by the Company during the Participant's lifetime.
Right to Designate
7.2. . If a Participant:
Failure of Designation
 
 
 
such Participant's Deferred Stock Account, or the part thereof as to which such Participant's designation fails, as the case may be, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries with a member surviving the Participant and (except in the case of surviving issue) in equal shares if there is more than one member in such class surviving the Participant:
Participant's surviving spouse
Participant's surviving issue per stirpes and not per capita
Participant's surviving parents
Participant's surviving brothers and sisters
Representative of Participant's estate.

To be eligible to disclaim, a Beneficiary must be a natural person, must not have received a distribution of all or any portion of the Deferred Stock Account at the time such disclaimer is executed and delivered, and must have attained at least age twenty-one (21) years as of the date of the Participant's death. Any disclaimer must be in writing and must be executed personally by the Beneficiary before a notary public. A disclaimer shall state that the Beneficiary's entire interest in the undistributed Deferred Stock Account is disclaimed or shall specify what portion thereof is disclaimed. To be effective, duplicate original executed copies of the disclaimer must be both executed and actually delivered to the Company after the date of the Participant's death but not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Participant's death. A disclaimer shall be irrevocable when delivered to the Company. A disclaimer shall be considered to be delivered to the Company only when actually received by the Company. The Company shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported disclaimer. Upon the filing of a valid disclaimer, the Beneficiary shall be considered not to have survived the Participant as to the interest disclaimed. A disclaimer by a Beneficiary shall not be considered to be a transfer of an interest in violation of the provisions of Section 8 and shall not be considered to be an assignment or alienation of benefits in violation of federal law prohibiting the assignment or alienation of benefits under this Plan. No other form of attempted disclaimer shall be recognized by the Company.
Disclaimers by Beneficiaries
7.4. . When used herein and, unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, when used in a Beneficiary designation, "issue" means all persons who are lineal descendants of the person whose issue are referred to, including legally adopted descendants and their descendants but not including illegitimate descendants and their descendants; "child" means an issue of the first generation; "per stirpes" means in equal shares among living children of the person whose issue are referred to and the issue (taken collectively) of each deceased child of such person, with such issue taking by right of representation of such deceased child; and "survive" and "surviving" mean living after the death of the Participant.
Definitions
 
7.5. . Unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, the following rules shall apply:
Special Rules
 
 
 
 
 
A Beneficiary designation is permanently void if it either is executed or is filed by a Participant who, at the time of such execution or filing, is then a minor under the law of the state of the Participant's legal residence. The Company shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported Beneficiary designation.
7.6. . Prior to the death of the Participant, no spouse or surviving spouse of a Participant and no person designated to be a Beneficiary shall have any rights or interest in the benefits credited under this Plan including, but not limited to, the right to be the sole Beneficiary or to consent to the designation of Beneficiaries (or the changing of designated Beneficiaries) by the Participant.
No Spousal Rights
7.7. . If, at the death of the Participant, any payment to the Participant was due or otherwise pending but not actually paid, the amount of such payment shall be included in the Deferred Stock Account which are payable to the Beneficiary (and shall not be paid to the Participant's estate).
Death Prior to Full Distribution
 
7.8. . In case of the legal disability, including minority, of a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to receive any distribution under this Plan, payment shall be made, if the Company shall be advised of the existence of such condition:
Facility of Payment
 
 
Any payment made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section shall constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of the Company therefor.
In no event shall the Company make any payment under this Plan to any assignee or creditor of a Participant or of a Beneficiary. Prior to the time of payment hereunder, a Participant or Beneficiary shall have no rights by way of anticipation or otherwise to assign or otherwise dispose of any interest under this Plan nor shall such rights be assigned or transferred by operation of the law.
9.1. . Nothing in this Plan will interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Board or the Company's shareholders to remove an Eligible Director or Participating Director from the Board. Neither this Plan nor any action taken pursuant to it will constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that the Board or the Company's shareholders have retained or will retain an Eligible Director or Participating Director for any period of time or at any particular rate of compensation.
Service as a Director
9.2. . Nothing contained in this Plan is intended to effect, modify or rescind any of the Company's existing compensation plans or programs or to create any limitations on the Board's power or authority to modify or adopt compensation arrangements as the Board may from time to time deem necessary or desirable.
Nonexclusivity of the Plan
 
The Board may suspend or terminate this Plan at any time. The Board may amend this Plan from time to time in such respects as the Board may deem advisable in order that this Plan will conform to any change in applicable laws or regulations or in any other respect that the Board may deem to be in the Company's best interests; provided, however, that no amendments to this Plan will be effective without approval of the Company's shareholders, if shareholder approval of the amendment is then required pursuant to Rule 16b-3 (or any successor rule) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market (or other exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are then listed and primarily traded). Following a termination of the Plan, Deferred Stock Accounts shall remain in the Plan until the Participant becomes eligible for the benefits under Section 6. The termination of the Plan shall not adversely affect any Participant or Beneficiary who has become entitled to the payment of any benefits under the Plan as of the date of termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent permissible under section 409A of the Code and the related Treasury regulations and guidance, if there is a termination of the Plan with respect to all Participants, the Board shall have the right, in its sole discretion, and notwithstanding any elections made by the Participant, to immediately pay all benefits in a lump sum following such termination of the Plan.
The Participating Directors and Beneficiaries thereof shall be general unsecured creditors of the Company with respect to any payments to be made pursuant to this Plan and shall not have any preferred interest by way of trust, escrow, lien or otherwise in any specific assets of the Company.

Vintage Account
2.1. . The Committee will establish the criteria for Participation in the Plan and make Incentive Compensation awards to Participants. No person shall be entitled to benefits under the Plan except as awarded by the Committee in its sole discretion, with or without receiving recommendations from Apogee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is anticipated that the Board of Directors and the respective boards of directors of each Subsidiary shall provide such recommendations to the Committee.
Selection of Participant
2.2. . In any instance where a Participant engages in acts or omissions including, but not limited to, (i) willful and substantial misconduct in the discharge of a Participant's duties as an officer or employee, or (ii) reckless failure or refusal to perform substantial and clear duties of employment, or (iii) criminal misconduct of the Participant, having the foreseeable likelihood or effect of causing a material loss of or damage to the properties, business or reputation of Apogee, or (iv) conferring an unauthorized and substantial pecuniary benefit upon the Participant or a designee of a Participant at the expense of Apogee, such acts or omissions may give rise to a finding by the Committee of a "Disqualification". In order for a Disqualification to become effective, the finding of the Committee must be ratified by not less than fifty percent (50%) of a quorum of the Board of Directors and not less than fifty percent (50%) of a quorum of the board of directors of the Apogee Company by whom the Participant is employed. If any Participant subject to Disqualification is a member of the board of directors of any Apogee Company, such Participant shall not cast a vote on any

For any Fiscal Year, any Participant may elect to defer (i) not greater than one-half, or (ii) any percentage less than one-half of the compensation that may become payable to the Participant under the Incentive Plan. The election shall be made in writing on the form set forth in Exhibit C, designating the percentage or amount of the compensation that may be due under the Incentive Plan which is to be deferred, signed by the Participant and delivered to the Committee prior to the commencement of the calendar year which includes the first day of the Fiscal Year with respect to which such compensation is to be earned and deferred. If an individual is first employed by Apogee during the calendar year which includes the first day of the Fiscal Year and is eligible for compensation under the Incentive Plan, that individual shall make the election to defer prior to the first day of employment. The election to defer under the Plan, once made, is irrevocable. The percentage or amount of the compensation that may be due under the Incentive Plan which is to be deferred shall cause the Committee to contribute an equivalent amount of cash or shares of Common Stock to the Trust on behalf of the Participant, such contribution constituting Pool A. Concurrently with the contribution to the Trust, Apogee shall cause to have issued shares of Restricted Stock in the name of the Participant designated as Pool B, which shares in number shall be equal at the time of issuance to the number of shares contributed to the Participant's Pool A Trust Fund for that Fiscal Year. Participant's Pool A Trust Fund shall be administered by the Trustee. Participant's Pool B Restricted Stock shall be escrowed with the Administrator. Within a reasonable time after the Committee's determination of the Participant's Incentive Compensation, Apogee shall transfer the Pool A shares or cash equivalent (to purchase an equivalent number of Pool A shares) to the Trustee to the credit of the Participant's Trust Fund.
This Plan is intended to conform to the provisions of Sections 83, 402, 404, 451, and 671 through 677 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("IRC" or the "Code"), with the provisions of Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and all
 
administrative and judicial interpretations thereof. As such this Plan shall be interpreted consistently with those laws and interpretations, shall not be interpreted to permit any action inconsistent with those laws or interpretations, and any provision herein inconsistent with those Laws or interpretations is hereby amended to make it consistent while still preserving, as nearly as possible, the original meaning of the amended provision.
5.1. . The Plan shall be administered by a Plan Compensation committee composed of either (i) the Board of Directors, a majority of which are Disinterested Persons and a majority of the directors acting on Plan matters are Disinterested Persons, or (ii) by a committee of three or more persons, all of whom are Disinterested Persons. "Disinterested Persons" shall be interpreted as that term is defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. No member of the Committee while serving as such shall be eligible for participation in the Plan. The Committee may appoint an Administrator who shall have the authority to manage and administer this Plan between meetings of the Committee and to carry out the resolutions of the Committee. All actions of the Administrator shall be subject to the Committee's review and approval.
Compensation Committee
5.2. . The Committee shall have the exclusive and final authority to interpret the Plan, prescribe, amend, and rescind the rules and regulations relating to the Plan, to delegate such responsibilities or duties as are allowable under the Plan or by law as it deems desirable, and make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and all determinations of the Committee will be made by a majority of the quorum. Any determination by the Committee under the Plan may be made without notice of and without convening a meeting if evidenced by one or more writings signed by all of the Committee members.
Powers
5.3. . In administering the Plan, neither the Committee nor any member of the Committee nor any person to whom the Committee may delegate any duty or power in connection with administering the Plan shall be liable, except as provided in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for any action, failure to act or loss except for its or his or her own gross negligence or willful misconduct, nor for the payment of any benefit or other amount under the Plan. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable under any contract, agreement, bond or other instrument made or executed by such member or in his or her behalf as a member of the Committee, nor for the neglect, omission or wrong-doing of any other member of the Committee.
No Liability
 
6.1. . The Deferred Compensation Trust Agreement (which is attached hereto and incorporated by reference herein as Exhibit A) was established on June 25, 1987. The Trust is irrevocable and administers Participant Pool A Trust Funds received by it in either cash or in Common Stock from Apogee. All contributions so received, and any income therefrom, shall be held, managed and administered by the Trustee as a single Trust. The Trust Agreement provides that the Trustee shall discharge its responsibilities for the investment, management and control of the Trust assets solely in the interest of the Participants and Beneficiaries of the Plan. All investments of the Trust assets shall be made in Common Stock; provided, however, that the Trustee may maintain such portion of the Trust assets in cash or forms of short-term liquid investments as it deems in the best interests of the Trust, provided that the Trust remains primarily invested in Common Stock. The property of the Trust will be held in the individual name of the Trustee. Any shares in the Trust will be voted by the Trustee in its discretion unless a Participant instructs the Trustee regarding the manner in which such shares credited to the Participant's Trust Fund shall be voted.
Establishment of Trust
6.2. . Following the award of Incentive Compensation to a Participant who has elected to defer a portion of such compensation under this Plan, and as soon thereafter as may be reasonably practicable, Apogee shall deposit with the Trustee (for the benefit of the Participant's Trust Fund) shares of Common Stock, or cash to purchase such stock, for which the purchase price per share is equal to the lesser of:
Deposits to Trust
 
 
The number of shares to be deposited with the Trust shall be computed by dividing the amount of Participant's Incentive Compensation award that was deferred by the aforementioned per share purchase price. Cash deposited with the Trust shall be sufficient to purchase the number of shares otherwise required to be deposited with the Trust. No fractional shares shall be issued; provided, however, that computed fractional shares below fifty percent (50%) shall be rounded to a lower non-fractional number, and fractional amounts in excess of forty-nine percent (49%) shall be rounded to the next whole number.
Each Apogee Company shall contribute the amount or Common Stock shares due to the Trust on behalf of Participants employed by it. Each Apogee Company shall pay, pro rata by its number of Participants, any and all administrative charges for opening and maintaining Trust Fund accounts for Participants and for brokerage commissions, if any, on purchases of Pool A and Pool B Common Stock.
6.3. . The Trustee shall establish a Trust Fund account and Vintage Account for each Participant of each Apogee Company, which accounts will be
Participant Trust Fund
 
maintained by the Trustee for each deposit made by Apogee under the Plan, and any charges or credits, including dividends and fees payable by the Trust. The Trust Fund accounts and Vintage Accounts shall be kept in the names of the individual Participants and each Beneficiary of a deceased Participant. The Trust shall issue annual and final statements to each Participant showing deposits, earnings, charges and credits to each of the Participant's Trust Fund account(s) and Vintage Account(s) (see 6.5 "Interest of Participant").
6.4. . The Trustee shall credit each Participant's Trust Fund account(s) and respective Vintage Account(s) with (i) the number of shares of Common Stock awarded to the Participant, or Common Stock or other shares purchased with cash and cash dividends, (ii) cash or stock dividends, and (iii) warrants or any other property received with respect to the stock in such account. Separate Vintage Accounts shall be established as subaccounts to all Participant Trust Fund accounts for each, and segregated by, Fiscal Year for which Pool A Incentive Compensation was contributed by Apogee. Each Vintage Account shall be debited or credited, as applicable, for additional shares purchased by the Trustee on the Participant's behalf, as a result of earnings in respect to stock noted in the Vintage Account, or for shares distributed from the Trust as a result of insolvency (see Section 6.6) or the occurrence of a predetermined event of distribution. Examples of such earnings or distributions include cash, stock, or property dividends, stock splits, warrants, options, reorganization, merger, exchange, insolvency, and the like. Distributions shall include or result from payments to Participants, forfeitures upon Disqualification, and the distribution of Trust assets by the Trustee to creditors of a respective Apogee Company. (See Section 6.5). To the extent Apogee incurs taxable income in respect to cash dividends declared and paid on Participant Pool A shares, Apogee shall have the right to require payment of such tax by the Trust, pursuant to appropriate written instruction to the Trustee, and Participant Trust Fund accounts and Vintage Accounts shall be charged accordingly. Common Stock purchased with cash dividends paid on such stock in Participant Trust Fund accounts and Vintage Accounts will vest in the Participant as of the date the Common Stock on which the dividend was paid vests.
Trust Fund Accounting
6.5. . Any funds deposited with, earned by or related to Participant Trust Fund accounts shall be and continue to be at all times part of the general assets of the respective Apogee Company depositing such funds, subject to the claims of its unsecured general creditors. In the event a Participant becomes an employee of any other Apogee Company, the Trustee shall establish a separate Trust Fund account and Vintage Account(s) for deposits made to the Trust by that company on behalf of the Participant. Assets of the Trust are not intended to serve as security for payment of Participant Trust Funds under the Plan if an Apogee Company is or becomes insolvent. All rights created under the Plan and the Trust shall be and are mere unsecured contractual rights of a Participant against the Apogee Company from whom the Participant was awarded Incentive Compensation in a particular Fiscal Year. The Participant's right to receive payments of deferred compensation under the Trust is and shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the applicable Apogee Company. No right, benefit or payment under this Plan shall be subject to attachment or other legal process for the debts of a Participant or any Beneficiary, and shall not be subject to anticipation, transfer, sale, assignment or encumbrance. No person, other than Participant (or Participant's Beneficiaries in the event of death) shall have any claim against Apogee by virtue of the provisions of the Plan.
Interest of Participant
 
6.6. . The Trustee shall be and is prohibited from making any payments to a Participant or any Beneficiary, whose Trust Fund was established and funded by a specific Apogee Company, upon or subsequent to notification in writing that such Apogee Company is unable to pay its debts as they mature or that it is subject as a debtor to a pending proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code. Under any such circumstances, the Trustee shall deliver any property held by the Trust on behalf of Participants of the insolvent Apogee Company if, and only if, a court of competent jurisdiction so directs in order to satisfy creditor claims of that Company. The Trustee shall have the right to seek and retain legal counsel to determine the competent jurisdiction of the court directing delivery of Trust assets and, if appropriate, may challenge such jurisdiction or the legality of such court's order in the name of the Trust in any court.
Insolvency
6.7. .
Distribution of Deferred Compensation Fund
 
 
 
 
6.8. . Apogee hereby authorizes Two Million Twenty Thousand (2,020,000) shares of Common Stock to be issued or purchased and designated as Pool A Common Stock pursuant to this Plan. Any Pool A shares that are returned to Apogee by Disqualification may be added to the number of shares available under the Plan for the purpose of funding Pool A.
Shares Subject to Plan
7.1. . In the event that a Participant elects to defer Incentive Compensation as provided in Section 3 hereof, then concurrently upon funding of the Pool A Trust, Apogee shall purchase or cause to have issued an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock in the name of the Participant as provided in and determined by Section 7.2.
Issuance and Ownership
7.2. . Common Stock transferred to a Participant as provided in Section 7.1 shall be and hereby is designated as Pool B Restricted Stock, subject to limitations on transferability of the shares, substantial risk of forfeiture, and legending as described in this Section 7.
Designation
7.3. . A Participant may not elect to be taxed in the year Pool B Restricted Stock is received on the difference between the Fair Market Value of such stock and the Participant's basis in such stock, without the express written consent of the Committee.
IRC ss.83
7.4. . Except as to Participant's vested interest in and to the Restricted Stock as provided hereinafter (Unrestricted Stock), a Participant or any Beneficiary of a Participant shall not sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, grant a lien in, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into a binding agreement to sell, pledge, hypothecate, encumber, grant a lien in, or otherwise dispose of) all or any of the Restricted Stock in the name of the Participant or any Beneficiary. Any stock which is no longer subject to Section 7.5, shall be freely transferable and considered Unrestricted Stock; provided, however, that transfer of the shares shall be made only in accord with applicable federal and state securities laws.
Restriction on Transfer of Shares
 
7.5. .
Legend and Stop Order Transfer
 
"The securities represented by this certificate are subject to a Restricted Stock Agreement by and between Apogee Enterprises, Inc. and the registered owner of such securities, and may not be sold, transferred, pledged, hypothecated, encumbered, liened, or otherwise disposed of unless in compliance with the terms of such Restricted Stock Agreement, a copy of which is on file at the principal office of Apogee Enterprises, Inc."
 
 
7.6. . The Committee may establish, in its sole discretion, events by which a Participant would forfeit his or her entire interest in Restricted Stock. Such events may include, but are not limited to:
Risk of Forfeiture
 
 
 
A forfeiture is not and shall not be interpreted to be a Disqualification (Section 2.2). In the event of a forfeiture of Restricted Stock, a Participant shall offer (or be deemed to have offered automatically) to Apogee all, and not less than all, of such Participant's Restricted Stock at a price equal to the lesser of the Participant's "tax basis" in the Restricted Stock or the Fair Market Value of such Stock on the date of forfeiture. The offer shall be made as soon as practicable after Participant's receipt of the Committee's written determination that an event of forfeiture has occurred. The terms of the purchase shall be cash in exchange for the Restricted Stock at the time of closing.

For the full year, Apogee continues to expect earnings of $0.88 to $0.94 per share on revenue growth of 13 to 17 percent. The company's third quarter ends December 2, 2006.

Apogee also announced that Michael B. Clauer, executive vice president (EVP), will be leaving the company effective December 31, 2006; in the interim, he will be transitioning his responsibilities for several Apogee businesses.

Draft 5 p.m. Friday, November 10
For Immediate Release
Monday, November 13, 2006
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (November 13, 2006)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOG) announced it is increasing its fiscal year 2007 earnings guidance to a range of $0.92 to $0.98 per share from previous guidance of $0.88 to $0.94 per share, driven primarily by the performance of the architectural segment. The company's third quarter ends December 2, 2006, and fiscal year ends March 3, 2007. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.
"Continued solid production efficiencies in our architectural segment, combined with a strong commercial construction market are allowing us to raise operating margin expectations for the year and, therefore, increase our earnings per share guidance," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We also have slightly increased our outlook potential for the large-scale optical segment, where we could see improved product mix for the remainder of the year.
"Somewhat offsetting these improvements are continued deterioration in markets and pricing for our auto glass businesses," said Huffer. "We have begun the process of transitioning the auto replacement windshield portion of our auto glass segment to support architectural glass fabrication.
"We are very encouraged by the strength in our architectural business and the accompanying improvement in operating margins," said Huffer. "We are pleased that our year-to-date architectural segment performance and strong backlog are allowing us to increase our earnings outlook for the year."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2007. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
Architectural segment revenues are expected to increase 16 to 19 percent (prior guidance was 17 to 21 percent).
        Growth is supported by the strong architectural backlog of $395.3 million at the end of October. Large-scale optical segment revenues are expected to be down slightly, consistent with prior guidance. Auto glass segment revenues are expected to be down more than 10 percent (prior guidance was down 5 to 10 percent).

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On November 20, 2006, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. ("Apogee") entered into a Resignation Agreement (the "Agreement") with Michael B. Clauer, Apogee's Executive Vice President (the "Executive"), pursuant to which the Executive will voluntarily resign from any and all offices of Apogee, and any other position, office or directorship of any other entity for which the Executive was serving at the request of Apogee, effective as of December 31, 2006. On October 23, 2006, Apogee issued a press release and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing that the Executive would be leaving the Company effective as of December 31, 2006.
Pursuant to the Agreement, the Executive agreed: (1) to keep certain information regarding Apogee confidential, (2) not to, directly or indirectly, engage in competition with Apogee or any of Apogee's subsidiaries or affiliates in any phase of the Business (as defined in the Agreement) of Apogee or its subsidiaries or affiliates through June 30, 2008, a period of 18 months after the effective date of his resignation ("Noncompetition Obligations"), and (3) not to solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee of Apogee or its subsidiaries or affiliates to leave his or her employment through December 31, 2009, a period of three years after the effective date of his resignation ("Nonsolicit Obligations"). The Agreement provides that if Apogee materially breaches any of the provisions of the Agreement and such breach is not cured within 15 days, the Executive may, at his option, terminate his Noncompetition Obligations and Nonsolicit Obligations.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Apogee will pay to the Executive separation pay in the amount of $556,800, which is equal to one and one half years of the Executive's current annual base salary of $371,200, as follows: $185,624 in a lump sum on July 3, 2007 and the balance in 26 biweekly installments of $14,276 on Apogee's regularly scheduled paydays commencing on July 1, 2007 and terminating on June 30, 2008. In addition, Apogee will pay the Executive in one lump sum $19,460 for COBRA payments and $9,744, which is an amount equal to 26 biweekly automobile allowance payments. Apogee further agrees to provide the Executive with outplacement assistance up to a maximum amount of $10,000. The Agreement provides that if the Executive materially breaches any of the provisions of the Agreement and such breach is not cured within 15 days, Apogee may, at its sole option, immediately terminate all remaining payments and benefits described in the Agreement and obtain payment from the Executive of all other damages and expenses resulting from such breach (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees), with the remainder of the Agreement remaining in full force and effect. In addition, the Agreement also provides that Apogee is entitled to seek injunctive relief in the event the Executive breaches his Noncompetition Obligations, Nonsolicit Obligations or other obligations under paragraph 3 of the Agreement with respect to Apogee's confidential information and the return of Apogee property.
The Executive's post-resignation eligibility for, and rights and obligations with respect to, any Apogee employee benefit as a past employee of Apogee under Apogee's retirement and welfare benefit plans are as set forth in the plan documents and are based on his employment termination as of December 31, 2006, the effective date of his resignation, and his entitlement to the benefits for the period of his participation in such plans, and his rights will be determined pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plans.
Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Agreement, Apogee and the Executive further agreed to release each other from any and all claims and causes of action of any kind that such party now has or may have had against the other party.
The foregoing description of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

NEWS RELEASE
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, December 20, 2006
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 20, 2006)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2007 third quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.
THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"We completed a very strong quarter, thanks to strength in our architectural segment where we delivered significant improvement in operating margins," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We benefited from greater than expected product and project mix, volume and operational improvements in the architectural segment during our seasonally strongest quarter of the year. In addition, our backlog and bidding activity remain high, and the non-residential construction markets continue to grow.

"The decline in the large-scale optical segment earnings compared to last year was a result of the unfavorable framing product mix within value-added glass that we had anticipated," he said.

OUTLOOK
"The performance of our architectural segment continues to improve. We finished the quarter stronger than anticipated due to a higher value-added mix and better operating performance in glass fabrication, installation and finishing," said Huffer. "As a result, we have again raised our earnings guidance for fiscal 2007. We are now expecting earnings per share of $0.98 to $1.04 for the current year, up from our guidance of $0.92 to $0.98 per share provided on November 13.
"The increase in our earnings guidance on the existing revenue base reflects our outlook for higher architectural segment operating margins resulting from better than expected productivity and mix. Our fiscal 2007 architectural operating margins are now anticipated to range from 5.6 to 5.8 percent, a significant increase from 3.2 percent in fiscal 2006.
"Regarding our other businesses, our outlook for the large-scale optical and auto glass segments remains unchanged," he said, adding, "Our auto glass segment has begun the process of transitioning its auto replacement windshield manufacturing capacity to support architectural glass fabrication.
"We expect a strong finish to fiscal 2007 and anticipate another quarter of year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year," Huffer said. He noted that the fourth quarter is generally a seasonally lower quarter than the third quarter in terms of revenues and margins for both the architectural and large-scale optical segments.
He concluded, "We continue to be optimistic about the commercial construction market and Apogee's future performance based on our architectural segment backlog and bidding activity. We are pleased to be progressing more quickly than we had expected toward our goal of reaching our prior peak architectural operating margin of 7.0 percent in two years."
The company plans to issue guidance for fiscal 2008 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2007. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iii) the costs of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; and v) foreign currency risk related to discontinued operations.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Monday, February 12, 2007
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (February 12, 2007)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today increased its fiscal 2007 earnings outlook and provided fiscal 2008 earnings guidance. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural, large-scale optical and automotive industries.
FISCAL 2007 OUTLOOK
"We are pleased to increase our outlook for fiscal 2007 earnings to $1.04 to $1.10 per share due to stronger performance to date in our fourth quarter, which ends March 3, 2007," said Russell Huffer, chairman and chief executive officer. Prior guidance was for earnings of $0.98 to $1.04 per share for the current year.
"We now anticipate that our revenues will be near the top of our prior range of 12 to 15 percent growth, with all of our businesses performing at or better than expectations," said Huffer.
"Our architectural and large-scale optical segments are expected to achieve operating margins at or near the top of our prior ranges, while the performance of our auto glass businesses, including the distribution joint venture, will be slightly more favorable than anticipated," he said. Prior fiscal 2007 operating margin guidance was 5.6 to 5.8 percent for the architectural segment and 11 to 12 percent for the large-scale optical segment.
"In addition, our outlook is for positive full-year free cash flow, and a slightly lower tax rate due to the extension of the federal research and development income tax credit," said Huffer. Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.

FISCAL 2008 OUTLOOK
"For fiscal 2008, we expect to build on our strong finish to the current year," said Huffer. "We anticipate another year of significant growth in fiscal 2008, led by the performance of our architectural segment. Our outlook is for earnings of $1.20 to $1.30 per share on overall revenue growth of 8 to 11 percent. Our architectural segment backlog, which has increased to approximately $398 million from $390 million at the end of the third quarter, supports this growth.
"For our architectural segment, we're anticipating revenue growth of 12 to 15 percent as we bring on new capacity, and operating margins of 6.4 to 6.7 percent, up significantly from our expected operating margin of approximately 5.8 percent for fiscal 2007," he said. "We expect to maintain the operating improvements we've achieved in our architectural glass business, while starting up our new Southwest facility during the first quarter. At the same time, we anticipate continued improvement in our installation and window businesses.
"Our commercial construction markets continue strong and the sectors we serve value our energy-efficient, hurricane and blast value-added glass products and services," said Huffer.
"As we continue to focus on growing our value-added picture framing glass business and transition away from pre-framed art and consumer electronics products, we expect our large-scale optical revenues will be down slightly in fiscal 2008," he said.
"Our auto glass revenues will decline significantly as we complete our exit of the auto replacement windshield market."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2008. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Commentary
"We are very pleased with fiscal 2007 results, which were driven by our architectural segment," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We achieved significant improvement in our architectural operating margin in fiscal 2007, increasing to 5.8 percent from 3.2 percent in the prior year. Architectural pricing increased, and operations improved. In addition, we had a better mix of projects with higher margins than during the prior year. And, strong markets supported our performance.
"We finalized our strategic plans to exit the auto glass segment, with the fourth quarter decision to sell the RV and bus windshield business," Huffer said. "We stopped producing aftermarket auto windshields late in fiscal 2007 and have started converting the facility to provide additional architectural glass capacity.
"Our large-scale optical segment fiscal 2007 results declined versus the prior year as some customers offered a less favorable mix of value-added framing products," he said. "However, later in the year, key framing customers converted to our best products, which offer visual benefits to consumers, and we started to see the positive results of this strategy at the end of the fourth quarter.
"As a result of our strong fourth quarter, we generated free cash flow of more than $8 million for the full year after investing approximately $40 million in capital expenditures," said Huffer. (Free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures.) "Our debt level of $35 million was also significantly lower than anticipated due to improved earnings, reduced working capital requirements and the timing of some capital expenditures.
"Our fourth quarter performance underscored the strength of our architectural segment, which delivered significant growth in both revenues and operating income," said Huffer. "Our architectural backlog again grew and now stands at $424 million, positioning Apogee for further growth in fiscal 2008."

margins," said Huffer. "We also lowered our expected tax rate for fiscal 2008, which accounts for $0.03 of the increase in our earnings per share outlook. Our earlier guidance for earnings from continuing operations was $1.20 to $1.30 per share.
"We are expecting continued strong performance from our architectural segment and anticipate operating margins of 6.4 to 6.7 percent, up significantly from our fiscal 2007 operating margin of 5.8 percent," said Huffer. "Fiscal 2008 architectural operating margins include the negative full-year impact of approximately 0.3 percent from the startup of our new Southwest facility during the first quarter. We expect to maintain the operating improvements we've achieved in our architectural glass business, and see continued improvement in our installation and window businesses.
"We are slightly increasing our architectural revenue outlook in terms of dollars, but with our stronger than expected revenue growth in the fourth quarter, the architectural growth rate for fiscal 2008 will be slightly lower than we had previously anticipated," he said. "Our current outlook is for architectural revenue growth of 10 to 13 percent.
"Our commercial construction markets continue to be strong, based on our backlog and market forecasts, and the sectors we serve value our energy-efficient, hurricane and blast value-added glass products and services," said Huffer.
"As we focus on growing sales of our best value-added picture framing glass products, we are now expecting operating margins of 11 to 12 percent for the large-scale optical segment," he said. "Segment revenues will be flat in fiscal 2008 as picture framing growth is offset by the planned sale of our pre-framed art/wall dcor product line and continued transition away from consumer electronics products.
"We anticipate another year of significant growth in fiscal 2008, led by the performance of our architectural segment," said Huffer. "We are more sharply focused on executing our strategies related to our architectural and picture framing businesses, with the planned exit of two smaller, non-core business lines this year."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2008. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

For Immediate Release
Tuesday, June 26, 2007
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 26, 2007)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2008 first quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"We are very pleased with our first quarter results," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our architectural segment met our expectations for a very strong quarter, while our large-scale optical segment results were better than we had anticipated due to a stronger mix of our best value-added framing glass products, which offer visual benefits to consumers.
"Our architectural segment, which more than doubled its operating income compared to last year, operated well in a strong market," said Huffer. "We also continue to benefit from good pricing and replacement of lower-margin legacy work with projects having higher margins. In addition, the startup and gradual ramp up of our new Utah architectural glass facility is on schedule.

"Our architectural backlog remains high at $413.7 million, and bidding activity continues to be strong," he said. "With the improving outlook for our picture framing and architectural businesses, we have increased our earnings guidance for fiscal 2008."

OUTLOOK
"We have increased our fiscal 2008 earnings guidance to $1.37 to $1.47 per share, as a result of the improved outlook for our picture framing and architectural businesses," said Huffer. "Our earlier guidance for earnings from continuing operations was $1.27 to $1.37 per share.
"We are expecting continued strong performance from our architectural segment and anticipate operating margins of 6.6 to 6.9 percent and revenue growth of 11 to 14 percent, both up slightly from our previous guidance," said Huffer. "Our architectural segment backlog of $413.7 million with improving margins supports this level of performance.
"Our commercial construction markets continue to be strong, based on our backlog and market forecasts," said Huffer. "In particular, the sectors we serve value our energy-efficient, hurricane and blast value-added glass products and services.
"As we successfully convert customers to a mix of our best value-added picture framing glass products, we are now expecting operating margins of 14 to 15 percent for the large-scale optical segment," he said. "Segment revenues will grow slightly in fiscal 2008 as picture framing growth is somewhat offset by the planned sale of our pre-framed art/wall dcor product line and continued transition away from consumer electronics products."
He also noted that the sale of the recreational vehicle and bus windshield business, which is now reported in discontinued operations, is expected to be completed in the third quarter.
"We are very optimistic about fiscal 2008 and anticipate another year of significant growth," said Huffer. "We are pleased to be benefiting from our strategies for growing our core architectural and picture framing businesses."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2008. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 19, 2007)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2008 second quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"We've completed another strong quarter, and are very pleased with our second quarter earnings and cash flow," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our architectural segment exceeded our expectations with slightly stronger than expected revenue due to project timing and flow. Our large-scale optical segment earnings benefited from a high mix of our best value-added framing glass products.
"Our architectural segment continued to operate well in a strong market," said Huffer. "Revenues increased significantly due to strong project flow and a low level of project delays in the quarter, and pricing remains good. In addition, the expansion of our architectural glass capacity, including the ramp up of the new Utah plant and conversion of our auto glass factory, is on schedule.
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

"Our architectural backlog remains high at $405.4 million, as we recorded new orders of $190 million, one of our highest booking quarters. We also continue to see high levels of bidding activity for future architectural business," he said. "With the stronger performance of our architectural and picture framing businesses, we have increased our earnings guidance for fiscal 2008."

OUTLOOK
"We remain optimistic about our businesses and markets served, and are positioned to meet our longer-term objectives of 8 percent annual revenue growth and 20 percent average earnings growth through fiscal 2010," said Huffer. "Our solid year-to-date earnings along with our strong backlog, commitments and bidding activity give us confidence in our ability to grow revenues and earnings through fiscal 2010.
"We have increased our fiscal 2008 earnings guidance for continuing operations to $1.43 to $1.53 per share, as a result of the stronger year-to-date performance of our architectural and picture framing businesses," said Huffer. The previous guidance for earnings from continuing operations was $1.37 to $1.47 per share.
"We have slightly increased our fiscal 2008 architectural segment guidance to revenue growth of 13 to 15 percent and operating margins of 6.7 to 7.1 percent," said Huffer. "Our commercial construction markets are strong. McGraw-Hill Construction forecasts growth for non-residential construction markets through fiscal 2009, with markets flat in fiscal 2010 and then modest growth for the following few years.
"Our continued high level of architectural segment backlog with improving margins also supports our positive architectural outlook," said Huffer. "I would like to underscore that sequential growth in our backlog isn't necessary for us to meet our objectives  we just need to maintain our backlog at high levels, which we are anticipating based on current market conditions and our strong bidding activity. In addition, this bidding activity allows us to select projects with higher margins.
"We expect continued strong performance in our picture framing glass business as we successfully convert customers to a mix of our best value-added picture framing glass products," he said. "Planned second half investments in picture framing glass coating capacity to meet increasing demand for our best products, as well as higher spending on sales and marketing to drive this growth will somewhat dampen second-half and full-year large-scale optical segment operating margins."
Huffer noted that the fiscal 2008 earnings outlook does not include the impact of initiatives that could lower the tax rate; the potential for the sale of Apogee's minority interest in the PPG Auto Glass joint venture, reported as equity income in affiliates; or any gain from the expected third quarter sale of the recreational vehicle and bus windshield business, reported in discontinued operations.
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2008. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

For Immediate Release
Wednesday, December 19, 2007
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 19, 2007)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2008 third quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

Commentary
"The installation project write-downs masked excellent third-quarter performances in all our other businesses, as well as with our other installation projects," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Strong operating performance, primarily in our picture framing, architectural glass and window businesses, is expected to offset the impact of write-downs on the installation projects for the full year.
"I want to underscore that our architectural markets and backlog remain strong, and our businesses are generally operating well, giving us the ability to grow earnings 20 percent annually in fiscal years 2009 and 2010," he said.
"The installation job write-downs were significant and extremely disappointing," said Huffer. "Poor execution early in three projects in one market, Florida, has resulted in material cost increases required to complete the projects within customer requirements and deadlines.
"Turning to the large-scale optical segment, earnings again benefited from a higher than expected mix of our best value-added framing glass products," he said. "The market continues to convert to these great products.
"Finally, we are pleased to be completing the exit of the non-strategic auto replacement glass industry, a key step in our strategic repositioning to focus on opportunities in our more profitable architectural and picture framing businesses," said Huffer. "In the third quarter, we completed the sale of our recreational vehicle and bus windshield business. In addition, we have agreed to sell our 34-percent interest in the PPG Auto Glass joint venture to PPG Industries. Although this sale results in a charge to earnings, it represents Apogee's best option to complete our strategic exit from the auto glass industry and will be a significant positive cash event, allowing us to reinvest in our core businesses."

OUTLOOK
"The strength of our businesses and markets served allows us to remain optimistic that we are positioned to meet our longer-term objectives of 8 percent annual revenue growth and 20 percent average earnings growth through fiscal 2010," said Huffer. "Our markets, which are expected to remain at or near today's high levels, along with our strong backlog, commitments and bidding activity give us confidence in our ability to grow revenues and earnings.
"Our architectural businesses, with the exception of the one installation market, have been performing well this year. Including the execution setback in the third quarter, we expect to have an architectural segment operating margin ranging from 6.4 to 6.8 percent, slightly below our prior range of 6.7 to 7.1 percent," said Huffer.
"Our picture framing business continues strong, allowing us to raise operating margin guidance for the year to approximately 18 percent from prior guidance of 16 percent," he said. "The better product mix this year will be somewhat offset by higher fourth-quarter investments in sales and marketing as well as capacity expansions, bringing the expected full-year operating margin outlook below the year-to-date level.
"We are expecting that strong fourth-quarter performances in other businesses will allow us to make up the third-quarter shortfall in our installation business," he said. "As a result, we are adjusting our fiscal 2008 guidance to reflect the $0.03 per share difference between the PPG Auto Glass impairment charge and the research and development net tax benefit. We're now anticipating earnings from continuing operations of $1.40 to $1.50 per share." Previous guidance was $1.43 to $1.53 per share.
"We have great businesses, strong markets and backlogs and, with the exception of the one installation market, our businesses are executing well," said Huffer. "I'm feeling very good about the future prospects and potential for Apogee and its businesses."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2008. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Friday, December 21, 2007
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 21, 2007)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced that it has purchased 100 percent of the stock of Michigan-based Tubelite Inc., which fabricates aluminum storefront, entrance and curtainwall products for the U.S. commercial construction industry, for approximately $44 million (plus or minus closing adjustments). Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
"The purchase of Tubelite, with annual revenues of approximately $60 million, is part of Apogee's strategy to grow its presence in architectural markets," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Tubelite brings a new, high-quality product line to Apogee  storefront and entrance products. The market for storefront and entrance products, which are part of every commercial construction project, is estimated to be more than $1 billion. These products are usually purchased and installed by the same glazing subcontractor that installs curtainwall and windows, two core product lines currently offered by Apogee companies.
"We expect the Tubelite business, which has operating margins consistent with our architectural segment, to be accretive to Apogee's earnings in fiscal 2009," said Huffer. "We are pleased that the current Tubelite management team, with its extensive industry expertise and experience, will continue with Apogee to lead Tubelite to even greater levels of performance."
"We're pleased to be joining a financially-strong, market leader that we've known for a long time," said Ken Werbowy, Tubelite president. "For many years, we've worked closely with Apogee's Linetec company, which applies paint and anodized finishes to Tubelite's extrusions, and are happy to be securing our relationship with a finisher known for quality services and quick lead times.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

"We're excited to become a member of Apogee's portfolio of architectural companies, which are also known for their leading brands, quality products and on-time services," said Werbowy. "We look forward to working with the other Apogee architectural businesses to further strengthen and grow our market position."
Apogee funded the acquisition from its existing revolving credit facility.

Apogee Enterprises, Inc. ("Apogee") has had in place severance agreements with its executive officers since 1999, and such agreements have been amended from time to time. In December 2007, Apogee's Compensation Committee and Board of Directors approved a new form of change in control severance agreement for Apogee's executive officers (the "2008 CIC Severance Agreements"). Consistent with the prior severance agreements, the 2008 CIC Severance Agreements are designed to retain the executive officers and provide for continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of Apogee (as "change in control" is defined in the 2008 CIC Severance Agreements). The 2008 CIC Severance Agreement provides that, in the event of a change in control of Apogee, each executive officer will have specific rights and receive specified benefits if the executive officer is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the 2008 CIC Severance Agreements) or the executive officer voluntarily terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined in the 2008 CIC Severance Agreements) within two years after the change in control. In these circumstances, executive officers will each receive a severance payment equal to either one or two times the executive officer's annual salary plus the executive's targeted annual bonus (as calculated under the terms of the 2008 CIC Severance Agreements). In addition, all options and restricted stock awards held by the executive officer that have not vested as of the change in control date will be immediately vested, and all Pool B shares held by the executive officer that have not vested as of the change in control date under the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan (2005 Restatement) will be immediately vested and paid. Apogee will also pay any excise taxes the executive officer may incur as a result of the severance payments and any income and excise taxes on the excise tax payments, and Apogee will continue to provide the executive officer medical benefits and certain other benefits for a two-year period following the change in control. The 2008 CIC Severance Agreements continue through December 31 of each year and provide that they are to be automatically extended for one-year terms unless Apogee gives prior notice of termination. The 2008 CIC Severance Agreements are designed to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
On January 2, 2008, Apogee executed 2008 CIC Severance Agreements with the named executive officers listed below. The multiplier used for determining each named executive officer's severance payments is included in the far right column of the table.
 
The foregoing description of the 2008 CIC Severance Agreements is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of 2008 CIC Severance Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Thursday, January 24, 2008
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (January 24, 2008)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq: APOG) announced today that its Board of Directors has increased its share repurchase authorization by 750,000 shares to 2,250,000 shares of the company's common stock; approximately 750,000 shares have already been purchased under this authorization. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
"We believe Apogee's stock represents an attractive investment at recent prices, and we intend to repurchase stock from time to time to reduce share dilution resulting from our incentive programs," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We continue to remain optimistic about the future prospects and potential for Apogee  we have great businesses, strong architectural markets and backlogs, and our businesses generally are executing well."
Apogee recently purchased 200,000 shares at a total cost of approximately $3 million. The company has remaining authority to repurchase approximately 1,500,000 shares. The company said that shares may be purchased from time to time through open market or private transactions, or Rule 10b-18 purchase plans, depending on market conditions.
Apogee has approximately 29 million shares of common stock outstanding. The repurchased shares will be available for re-issuance for employee stock option and other stock-based benefit plans, and for other corporate purposes. The company intends to fund such repurchases with operating cash flow or via its revolving credit facility.
GUIDANCE REAFFIRMED
Apogee will be participating in investor meetings in late January and February and, therefore, today reaffirmed its existing fiscal year 2008 earnings guidance. For the full year, Apogee continues to expect earnings of $1.40 to $1.50 per share on revenue growth of 12 to 14 percent, which includes anticipated fourth quarter revenues from the acquisition of Tubelite in December 2007. The company's fourth quarter ends March 1, 2008.

"The sale of our 34 percent interest in the PPG Auto Glass joint venture will not occur as expected in the fourth quarter," said Huffer. "As previously stated, the sale of our interest in the joint venture was subject to PPG Industries' pending sale of its automotive original equipment manufacturing and automotive replacement glass businesses; PPG notified Apogee in late December 2007 that the prospective buyer intended to terminate the agreement to purchase these businesses.
"Apogee will continue to hold its interest in PPG Auto Glass, which is reported in equity in affiliates," said Huffer. He noted that it is a non-strategic asset for Apogee.
"Our fiscal 2009 earnings outlook, which includes Tubelite, is for approximately 25 percent earnings per share growth," said Huffer. "The strength of our businesses and markets served allow us to remain optimistic that we are positioned to meet our longer-term objectives of 8 percent annual revenue growth and 20 percent average earnings growth through fiscal 2010.
"Our architectural markets, which are expected to remain at or near today's high levels, along with our strong backlog, commitments and bidding activity give us confidence in our ability to grow revenues and earnings," Huffer said. He added that the backlog grew slightly to $459 million at the end of December, from $457 million a month earlier at the end of the third quarter.
"In addition, our picture framing business continues to perform well in weak retail conditions, as we convert customers to our highest-value added framing glass products," said Huffer.
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2008, including the impact of the acquisition of Tubelite, which will be reported in the architectural segment. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow; ii) economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully utilize production capacity; v) ramp up to full production of the third Viracon plant in a timely and cost-efficient manner; and vi) integration of the Tubelite business; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iii) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; iv) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and v) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2007.

EXHIBIT 10.1
 
 
 
 
APOGEE ENTERPRISES, INC., a Minnesota corporation (the "Principal Sponsor"), and certain affiliated corporations maintain a tax-qualified defined contribution plan known as APOGEE ENTERPRISES, INC. 401(k) RETIREMENT PLAN (also known as the "qualified plan") for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to certain eligible employees. The qualified plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and is intended to qualify as defined contribution plan under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). By operation of section 401(a)(16) of the Code, annual additions to the qualified plan are restricted so that they do not exceed certain maximum annual additions allowed under section 415 of the Code. Further, section 401(a)(17) of the Code restricts the maximum amount of annual compensation which may be taken into account in determining the contributions for any employee under the qualified plan.
Section 3(36) and section 4(b)(5) of ERISA recognize and authorize the establishment of an unfunded, nonqualified plan of deferred compensation maintained by an employer solely for the purpose of providing benefits for employees in excess of the limitations on benefits imposed under section 415 of the Code. Section 201, 301 and 401 of ERISA also recognize the creation of an unfunded plan maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees. The Principal Sponsor, pursuant to these provisions of ERISA, previously established and now maintains the APOGEE ENTERPRISES, INC. EXECUTIVE SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN (also known as the "restoration plan") for the benefit of certain management or highly compensated employees who are Participants in the qualified plan for the purpose of restoring a portion of the benefits lost due to the application of the 415 and 401(a)(17) limitations imposed on benefits payable under the qualified plan.
It is in the interest of the Employers to provide benefits to certain select officers and management employees in excess of those that can and are being provided under the qualified plan, the restoration plan and other qualified and nonqualified deferred compensation plans as an inducement for them to remain in the service of the Employers. It is also in the interest of the Employers to provide additional benefits to compensate select officers and management employees for qualified and nonqualified retirement benefits that would have been earned but for a mid-career change of employment and to provide an incentive to remain with the Principal Sponsor.
The Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan was adopted by Apogee Enterprises, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, and first effective January 1,
1998, and as amended and restated in this document effective January 1, 2005. However, it is not the intent of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. to in any manner limit any of the grandfathering provisions found in Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1, the proposed regulations or Code Section 409A. This restatement will be administered and construed on a basis consistent with this intent.

Social Security Benefit
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.1.22.  a complete severance of an employee's employment relationship with the Employers and all subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, for any reason other than the employee's death.

If a court of competent jurisdiction, any representative of the U.S. Department of Labor or any other governmental, regulatory or similar body makes any direct or indirect, formal or informal, determination that an individual is not a member of a select group of management or highly compensated employees (as that expression is used in ERISA), such individual shall not be (and shall not have ever been) a Participant in this Officers' SERP at any time. If any person not so defined has been erroneously treated as a Participant in this Officers' SERP, upon discovery of such error such person's erroneous participation shall immediately terminate and upon demand such person shall be obligated to reimburse the Principal Sponsor for all amounts erroneously paid to him or her.
Overriding Exclusion
ab initio
 
3.1. .
Supplemental Retirement Benefit for Participants
3.1.1. . Upon the Termination of Employment of a Participant for reasons other than death:
Entitlement and Amount
 
 
 
the Participant shall be entitled to the supplemental retirement benefit provided for in this Plan Statement.
The monthly amount of the supplemental retirement benefit shall be the amount of the Participant's Accrued SERP Benefit determined as of the Participant's Termination of Employment. However, if the Annuity Starting Date of the supplemental retirement benefit is before (but not more than one hundred twenty months before) the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the Participant would attain Normal Retirement Date, the amount thereof shall be reduced five-ninths of one percent (5/9%) for each of the first sixty (60) months and five-eighteenths of one percent (5/18%) for each of the next sixty (60) months by which the Annuity Starting Date precedes the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the Participant would attain Normal Retirement Date. If the Annuity Starting Date is more than one hundred twenty (120) months before the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the Participant would attain Normal Retirement Date, and
 
 
 
3.1.2. . In the absence of an election to the contrary (and except as provided below), the form of the supplemental retirement benefit is a Single Life Annuity with an Annuity Starting Date on the first day of the calendar month next following the calendar month in which the Participant's Termination of Employment occurs.
Form of Benefit-When Payable
 
 
 
The Participant may make, rescind and file new elections from time to time and at any time and without the consent of any spouse, Beneficiary or joint annuitant but the election last received by the Principal Sponsor at least one (1) year prior to the Participant's Termination of Employment shall be the only election given effect.
 
 
 
The Participant must make this one time election:
 
 
If the Participant has a Termination of Employment in 2006, the Participant's Post 2004 Benefit will be paid in accordance with the default rule stated in Section 3.1.2, regardless of whether the Participant filed an election.
 
3.1.3. . Notwithstanding Section 3.1.2, if payments are to be made on account of Termination of Employment to a Key Employee (as defined in Section 409A of the Code), payment of the Participant's Post 2004 Benefit payable under Section 3.1.2 above shall be suspended until a date that is six (6) months after the date of the Termination of Employment. As soon as administratively feasible after the six (6) month anniversary of the Participant's Termination of Employment, the Participant shall receive all payments, without interest, the Participant would have been entitled to receive during this six month period had the Participant not been a Key Employee. Thereafter, payments shall be made in accordance with Section 3.1.2. above. If a Participant dies prior to receiving a payment under this Section no benefit shall be paid under this Section.
Key Employee
3.1.4. . If the Participant dies prior to receiving a payment in accordance with Section 3.1.3, the Participant's Beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the amount of payments, without interest, the Participant would have been entitled to receive prior to the Participant's death had the Participant not been a Key Employee.
Beneficiary of Key Employee
3.1.5. . In lieu of the Single Life Annuity form of pension, a Participant may elect as provided above from among the following additional optional forms of pension.
Optional Forms of Pension
 
 
 
3.1.6. . If any Participant is entitled to receive payment under this Officers' SERP on account of a previous Termination of Employment and is subsequently reemployed by an Employer, such payment shall be discontinued until there is a subsequent Termination of Employment and upon such subsequent Termination of Employment the Participant's benefit shall be adjusted for the benefits previously received.
Suspension Upon Reemployment
3.2. .
Survivor Benefit  Death Before Annuity Starting Date
3.2.1. . Upon the death of a Participant who died:
When Available
 
 
 
 
a monthly survivor annuity shall be payable to the surviving spouse to whom the Participant was married for at least one (1) year ending on the date of death.
3.2.2. . The amount of the monthly survivor annuity shall be the amount which the surviving spouse would have received if the Participant:
Amount
 
 
 
 
3.2.3. . The first payment of this monthly survivor annuity shall be due on the first day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which the Participant dies. The last payment of this monthly survivor annuity shall be due to the surviving spouse on the first day of the calendar month in which the surviving spouse dies. Any election, rescission or other action taken by the Participant shall have no effect on the monthly survivor annuity payable under this Section. No other death benefit shall be payable with respect to a Participant who dies before his or her Annuity Starting Date.
Form of Benefit-When Payable
3.3. . The only death benefits which shall be payable under the Plan upon the death of a Participant after his or her Annuity Starting Date shall be the unpaid installments of annuity, if any, which are to be continued under the form of pension which the Participant has elected.
Survivor Benefit  Death After Annuity Starting Date
3.4. .
Designation of Beneficiaries
3.4.1. . This Section shall apply to the payment of unpaid installments of annuity, if any, which are to be continued under the Term Certain and Life Annuity after the death of the Participant and shall not apply to the payment of any benefits pursuant to any Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity. In addition, this Section shall apply to the payment of any amount due the Beneficiary of a Key Employee pursuant to Section 3.1.4.
Scope
3.4.2. . Each Participant may designate, upon forms to be furnished by and filed with the Principal Sponsor, one or more primary Beneficiaries or alternative Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of the unpaid installments of annuity, if any, in the event of the Participant's death. The Participant may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent from any Beneficiary, designated joint annuitant or spouse. No such designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless executed by the Participant and received by the Principal Sponsor during the Participant's lifetime.
Right To Designate Beneficiaries
 
3.4.3. . If a Participant:
Failure of Designation
 
 
 
the unpaid installments of annuity, if any, or the part thereof as to which such Participant's designation fails, as the case may be, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries with a member surviving the Participant and (except in the case of the Participant's surviving issue) in equal shares if there is more than one member in such class surviving the Participant:
Participant's surviving spouse
Participant's surviving issue per stirpes and not per capita
Participant's surviving parents
Participant's surviving brothers and sisters
Representative of Participant's estate.
3.4.4. . A Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of unpaid installments of annuity, if any, may disclaim his or her interest therein subject to the following requirements. To be eligible to disclaim, a Beneficiary must be a natural person, must not have received a distribution of all or any portion of a benefit at the time such disclaimer is executed and delivered, and must have attained at least age twenty-one (21) years as of the date of the Participant's death. Any disclaimer must be in writing and must be executed personally by the Beneficiary before a notary public. A disclaimer shall state that the Beneficiary's entire interest in the undistributed benefit is disclaimed or shall specify what portion thereof is disclaimed. To be effective, an original executed copy of the disclaimer must be executed and actually delivered to the Principal Sponsor after the date of the Participant's death but not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Participant's death. A disclaimer shall be irrevocable when delivered to the Principal Sponsor. A disclaimer shall be considered to be delivered to the Principal Sponsor only when actually received by an officer or other senior management employee of the Principal Sponsor who is familiar with and involved in the administration of this Officers' SERP. The Principal Sponsor shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported disclaimer. Upon the filing of a valid disclaimer, the Beneficiary shall be considered not to have survived the Participant as to the interest disclaimed. A disclaimer by a Beneficiary shall not be considered to be a transfer of an interest in violation of the provisions of Section 5.4 and shall not be considered to be an assignment or alienation of benefits in violation of federal law prohibiting the assignment or alienation of benefits under this Plan. No other form of attempted disclaimer shall be recognized by the Principal Sponsor.
Disclaimers by Beneficiaries
 
3.4.5. . When used herein and, unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, when used in a Beneficiary designation, "issue" means all persons who are lineal descendants of the person whose issue are referred to, including legally adopted descendants and their descendants but not including illegitimate descendants and their descendants; "child" means an issue of the first generation; "per stirpes" means in equal shares among living children of the person whose issue are referred to and the issue (taken collectively) of each deceased child of such person, with such issue taking by right of representation of such deceased child; and "survive" and "surviving" mean living after the death of the Participant.
Definitions
3.4.6. . Unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, the following rules shall apply:
Special Rules
 
 
 
 
 
 
A Beneficiary designation is permanently void if it either is executed or is filed by a Participant who, at the time of such execution or filing, is then a minor under the law of the state of the Participant's legal residence. The Principal Sponsor shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported Beneficiary designation.
3.5. . In case of legal incompetency (including minority) of a person entitled to receive any payment under this Officers' SERP, payment may be made, if the Principal Sponsor has been advised of the existence of such condition:
Payment in Case of Incompetency or Disability
 
 
Any payment made in accordance with this Section shall constitute a complete discharge of any liability or obligation of this Officers' SERP and the Principal Sponsor and all Employers therefor.
 
4.1. . The obligation of the Principal Sponsor to make payments under this Officers' SERP constitutes only the unsecured (but legally enforceable) promise of the Principal Sponsor to make such payments. The Participant shall have no lien, prior claim or other security interest in any property of any Principal Sponsor. If a fund (including, for example, a rabbi trust) is established by the Principal Sponsor in connection with this Officers' SERP, the property therein shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Principal Sponsor. Except to the extent the Principal Sponsor in its discretion may establish and pay benefits from such a fund (including, for example, a rabbi trust), the Principal Sponsor will pay the cost of this Officers' SERP out of its general assets.
Unfunded Obligation
4.2. . If the Principal Sponsor elects to finance all or a portion of its costs in connection with this Officers' SERP through the purchase of life insurance or other investments, the Participant agrees, as a condition of participation in this Officers' SERP, to cooperate with the Principal Sponsor in the purchase of such investment to any extent reasonably required by the Principal Sponsor and relinquishes any claim he or she may have either for himself or herself or any beneficiary to the proceeds of any such investment or any other rights or interests in such investment. If a Participant fails or refuses to cooperate, then notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan Statement (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Section 4) the Principal Sponsor shall immediately and irrevocably terminate and forfeit the Participant's entitlement to benefits under this Officers' SERP.
Hedging Investments
4.3. . Neither the Principal Sponsor's officers nor any member of its Board of Directors in any way secures or guarantees the payment of any benefit or amount which may become due and payable hereunder to or with respect to any Participant. Each Participant and other person entitled at any time to payments hereunder shall look solely to the assets of the Principal Sponsor for such payments as an unsecured, general creditor. After benefits shall have been paid to or with respect to a Participant and such payment purports to cover in full the benefit hereunder, such former Participant or other person or persons, as the case may be, shall have no further right or interest in the other assets of the Principal Sponsor in connection with this Officers' SERP. Neither the Principal Sponsor nor any of its officers nor any member of its Boards of Directors shall be under any liability or responsibility for failure to effect any of the objectives or purposes of this Officers' SERP by reason of the insolvency of the Principal Sponsor.
Consensual Creditor
 
5.1. .
Amendment and Termination
5.1.1. . Prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Board of Directors of the Principal Sponsor may unilaterally amend the Plan Statement prospectively, retroactively or both, at any time and for any reason deemed sufficient by it without notice to any person affected by this Officers' SERP and may likewise terminate this Officers' SERP both with regard to persons expecting to receive benefits in the future; provided, however, that:
Before a Change in Control
 
 
5.1.2. .
After a Change in Control
 
 
 
 
 
5.1.3. . No modification of the terms of the Plan Statement or termination of the Officers' SERP shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed on behalf of the Principal Sponsor by a person authorized to execute such writing. No oral representation concerning the interpretation or effect of the Plan Statement shall be effective to amend the Plan Statement.
No Oral Amendments
5.1.4. . The Principal Sponsor will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Principal Sponsor), by agreement, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Officers' SERP in the same manner and to the same extent that the Principal Sponsor would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place.
Plan Binding on Successors
5.1.5. . Following a termination of the Plan, Accrued SERP Benefits shall remain in the Plan until the Participant becomes eligible for the benefits provided in Section 3. The termination of the Plan shall not adversely affect any Participant or Beneficiary who has become entitled to the payment of any benefits under the Plan as of the date of termination.

The rules of section 3121(v) and section 3306(r)(2) of the Code shall apply to this Officers' SERP. Apogee has affirmatively determined that all amounts deferred under the Plan that were earned and vested before January 1, 2005, shall not be subject to section 409A of the Code (i.e., will be "grandfathered" under the law as it existed before section 409A of the Code) and this Plan Statement shall be construed and administered accordingly.

All such amendments and termination shall be given effect under this Officers' SERP (it being expressly intended that this Officers' SERP shall not lock in the benefit structures of the Defined Contribution Plans or any other plan as they exist at the adoption of this Officers' SERP or upon the commencement of participation, or commencement of benefits by any Participant).
Effect on Other Plans
8.4. . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan Statement or any election or designation made under this Officers' SERP, any individual who feloniously and intentionally kills a Participant shall be deemed for all purposes of this Officers' SERP and all elections and designations made under this Officers' SERP to have died before such Participant. A final judgment of conviction of felonious and intentional killing is conclusive for this purpose. In the absence of a conviction of felonious and intentional killing, the Principal Sponsor shall determine whether the killing was felonious and intentional for this purpose.
Disqualification

For Immediate Release
Wednesday, April 9, 2008

Commentary
"Fiscal 2008 was another year of record earnings for Apogee," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We had strong operating income in both our architectural and large-scale optical segments." He added that both segments also had significant growth in fourth quarter earnings, with drivers for each of the segments consistent for the fourth quarter and full year.
"Our architectural segment has been operating well in markets that are using more and more value-added design and energy-efficient products," he said. "Project mix, pricing, high capacity utilization and productivity improvements contributed to our strong performance and improving operating margins.
"As we enter fiscal 2009, we are positioned for continued strong growth for our architectural segment," said Huffer. "We started the new year with our highest architectural backlog ever  $510.9 million. We have strong visibility for fiscal 2009 and into fiscal 2010 due to our backlog, project commitments, strong bidding activity and the construction levels and green building trends in markets we serve.
"Turning to the large-scale optical segment, earnings again benefited from an increased mix of our best value-added framing glass products," he said. "Although retail and picture framing market conditions softened during the year, we continue to convert framers to these great products.
"We made two strategic moves in fiscal 2008 that began to contribute to growing our architectural segment," said Huffer. "In the fourth quarter, we acquired Tubelite, with annual revenues of approximately $60 million. Tubelite fabricates aluminum storefront, entrance and curtainwall products for the U.S. commercial construction industry, a large adjacent market we didn't previously serve. We also completed our exit of windshield manufacturing operations and have now converted that facility to serve our strongest business, architectural glass fabrication.
"In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 339,000 shares at an average price of $15.96 per share, for a total of $5.4 million," Huffer added. "We hadn't repurchased shares for several quarters and felt it was an attractive investment."

OUTLOOK
"We are expecting another outstanding year in fiscal 2009," said Huffer. "We are entering the year stronger than ever in our architectural segment, which will drive our performance this year. Demand for our architectural products and services remains healthy, our backlog is at a record level, new capacity is in place, and we have opportunities for further operational improvements.

"We are expecting to earn from $1.82 to $1.94 per share from continuing operations, which would represent a 22 to 30 percent increase over fiscal 2008 results," he said. "At the same time, we anticipate revenue growth of 12 to 15 percent.
"Looking ahead to fiscal 2010, our longer term goals of 8 percent annual revenue growth and 20 percent average earnings growth remain achievable, despite mixed signals from industry forecasters," said Huffer. "We are positive about the prospects for our business based on the size and mix of our backlog for fiscal 2010 and our bidding activity, as well as the increase in green building and our ability to expand into markets currently underserved by Apogee, including the broader, small project and international markets.
"For the current year, we expect our architectural business will increase revenues 13 to 16 percent and achieve an operating margin ranging from 8.0 to 8.3 percent," he said. "This margin outlook shows continued improvement from our fiscal 2008 operating margin of 6.7 percent. In fiscal 2009, we are expecting a more balanced project mix, compared to the fiscal 2008 fourth quarter when our operating margin was 8.9 percent with favorable project mix and timing in our window business.
"Our picture framing business continues to convert customers to our best framing glass and acrylic products," Huffer said. "As a result, in a soft retail and custom picture framing market, we expect to maintain revenues, with margins ranging from 17.5 to 18.5 percent.
"We have great businesses, solid markets and backlogs, new capacity and our businesses are executing well," said Huffer. "I'm feeling very good about the future prospects and potential for Apogee and its businesses."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2009. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.

The discussion above, including all statements in the Outlook section, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow; ii) economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully utilize production capacity; and v) ramp up to full production of the third Viracon plant in a timely and cost-efficient manner; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iii) performance of the PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2007.

On May 5, 2008, the Company entered into a change-in-control severance agreement with Gregory A. Silvestri, Executive Vice President, using substantially the same form of agreement as the 2008 form of change-in-control agreement approved by the Company's Compensation Committee and Board of Directors in December 2007.
Consistent with the change-in-control severance agreements entered into with certain executive officers in January 2008, the change-in-control severance agreement between the Company and Mr. Silvestri (the "Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement") is designed to retain Mr. Silvestri and provide for continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change-in-control of the Company (as "change-in-control" is defined in the Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement). The Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement provides that, in the event of a change-in-control of the Company, Mr. Silvestri has specific rights and receives specific benefits if he is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement) or he voluntarily terminates his employment for "good reason" (as defined in the Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement) within two years after the change-in-control. In these circumstances, Mr. Silvestri will receive a severance payment equal to two times his annual salary base plus his targeted annual bonus (as calculated in the Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement). In addition, all options and restricted stock awards held by Mr. Silvestri that have not vested as of the change-in-control date will be immediately vested. The Company will also pay any excise taxes Mr. Silvestri may incur as a result of the severance payment and any income and excise taxes on the excise tax payment, and the Company will continue to provide Mr. Silvestri medical benefits and certain other benefits for a two-year period following the change-in-control. The Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement continues through December 31 of each year and provides that it is automatically extended for one-year terms unless the Company gives prior notice of termination. The Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement is designed to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.
The foregoing description of the Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Silvestri CIC Severance Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

On June 24, 2008, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. A copy of this press release is furnished (not filed) as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Tuesday, June 24, 2008
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 24, 2008)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2009 first quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"We feel good about our first quarter results, which met Apogee's expectations for improvement in architectural segment revenues and earnings as all businesses performed well," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "The architectural segment operating margin was slightly lower than we had expected due to project and product mix, and productivity." He noted that the company tends to experience slightly lower first quarter seasonal revenues.
"Our large-scale optical segment operating margin remained high and met our expectations, as our best value-added products were more than 50 percent of segment sales for the third consecutive quarter," said Huffer. "We continue to convert customers to our best glass and acrylic framing products, even though elimination of less-profitable product lines and soft picture framing market conditions impacted revenues.

"With the ongoing strength in our architectural segment, we remain optimistic about Apogee's outlook and are reconfirming our earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2009," said Huffer. "We have strong visibility for fiscal 2009 and into fiscal 2010 due to our backlog, project commitments, solid bidding activity, and the construction levels and green building trends in markets we serve."

OUTLOOK
"We are expecting another record year in fiscal 2009, as demand for our architectural products and services remains healthy, our backlog continues at a high level, new capacity is in place, and we have opportunities for further operational improvements," said Huffer. "We are reconfirming our earnings per share guidance of $1.82 to $1.94 from continuing operations, which would represent a 22 to 30 percent increase over fiscal 2008 results, and revenue growth of 12 to 15 percent.
"Looking ahead to fiscal 2010, our longer term goals of 8 percent annual revenue growth and 20 percent average earnings growth remain achievable, despite mixed signals from industry forecasters," said Huffer. "We continue to see high levels of construction activity in markets utilizing our value-added products and services, reflected in the size and mix of our backlog beyond fiscal 2009 and our bidding activity, which continues strong and allows us to fill our capacity with good work. We also see opportunities resulting from the increase in green building, a sector demanding our energy-efficient products, and our ability to expand into markets currently underserved by Apogee, including the broader, mid-sized project and international markets.
"For the current year, we have slightly increased our architectural segment revenue guidance to 14 to 17 percent growth, from 13 to 16 percent," he said. "At the same time, we expect our architectural business will achieve an operating margin ranging from 7.8 to 8.1 percent, down somewhat from our prior guidance of 8.0 to 8.3 percent and up from our fiscal 2008 architectural operating margin of 6.7 percent.
"Our architectural segment margin outlook shows continued improvement over the balance of fiscal 2009. We will continue to ramp up new architectural glass capacity and expect improved mix and project flow; at the same time, we expect to leverage increased overhead spending over the remainder of the year," said Huffer. "However, our architectural segment operating margin outlook has declined from our prior guidance, driven by increased costs, primarily for fuel and petroleum-based materials.
"Our picture framing business continues to convert customers to our best framing glass and acrylic products, allowing us to raise operating margin guidance for the year to 18 to 19 percent, from previous guidance of 17.5 to 18.5 percent. We expect the second half to be stronger than the first half, which will be slightly impacted by investments in new capacity that will come on line in the third quarter," Huffer said. "We now anticipate revenues to decline slightly as a result of soft retail and custom picture framing market conditions.

"Our businesses are executing well, and we have solid markets and backlogs, new capacity and strong cash flow," said Huffer. "I'm feeling very good about the future prospects and potential for Apogee and its businesses."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2009. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The discussion above, including all statements in the Outlook section, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen delays in project timing and work flow; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully utilize production capacity; and v) ramp up to full production of the third Viracon plant in a timely and cost-efficient manner; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile;

ii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iii) performance of the PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 1, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, September 17, 2008
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 17, 2008)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2009 second quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"Architectural segment revenue growth continued in the second quarter, and operating performance was strong in all segment businesses except architectural glass, where internal operational challenges impacted us throughout the quarter," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer.
"Our large-scale optical segment turned in a strong operating margin performance, while revenues were negatively impacted primarily by the elimination of less-profitable product lines and somewhat by soft picture framing market conditions," he said. "In addition, the company continued to generate significant positive cash flow in the quarter.

"We are bringing down our fiscal 2009 full-year guidance due to softer and uncertain architectural market conditions that are resulting in project delays and cancellations in our architectural glass business, along with operational issues this business experienced in the second quarter," said Huffer.

OUTLOOK
"In recent weeks, we've seen rapid changes in commercial construction markets, and are expecting our full-year earnings to be impacted by reduced volume due to project delays and a small number of cancellations, as well as the internal operational challenges in our architectural glass fabrication business that affected us in the second quarter," said Huffer. "We do expect that improving operations in our window and installation businesses, and ongoing strong operating performance in our picture framing business will continue in the second half.
"Our outlook now is for earnings from continuing operations of $1.65 to $1.82 per share, compared to prior guidance of $1.82 to $1.94 per share," he said. "We are encouraged that we will continue to grow our earnings and revenues, despite the uncertain market conditions affecting the timing of architectural projects, and operational challenges in our largest business.
"The non-residential market changes have caused some work to move out of the current fiscal year, and it appears we will not be able to fill in all open capacity that has been created due to the long selling cycle for much of our architectural glass and window work," said Huffer. "At the same time, while bidding activity remains strong, future work is not filling in our backlog as quickly as we had anticipated because the time between project bids and awards seems to be growing. In addition, there are more U.S. competitors on mid-size to smaller projects, creating some pricing pressures.
"With the increasing uncertainty in commercial construction markets, we will be waiting until our third quarter release in mid December to update our fiscal 2010 outlook," he said.
"For fiscal 2009, we have decreased our architectural segment revenue growth guidance to 11 to 14 percent, from 14 to 17 percent," he said. "At the same time, we expect our architectural segment operating margin will range from 6.4 to 7 percent, down from prior expectations largely due to the architectural glass operating challenges, revenue declines and expected second-half cost increases, primarily for fuel and petroleum-based materials, somewhat offset by anticipated operating improvements in our installation and window businesses.
"Our picture framing business continues to convert customers to our best framing glass and acrylic products, allowing us to raise operating margin guidance for the year to approximately 22 percent, from previous guidance of 18 to 19 percent. We expect second half revenues and operating margin to be stronger than the first half, as we leverage the new capacity which has come on line at the beginning of the third quarter," Huffer said.

"We believe that our markets offer significant longer-term opportunities, due to the increasing importance of green building, a sector demanding energy-efficient products that we supply, and the overall growth in the use of value-added products in commercial construction projects," said Huffer. "Our goal is for Apogee, as a market leader with great products and services, to continue to outperform non-residential markets through the ups and downs of construction cycles."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2009. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The discussion above, including all statements in the Outlook section, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities. Additional factors include: i)

revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iii) performance of the PPG Auto Glass, LLC joint venture; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 1, 2008.

(e) On October 8, 2008, the Board of Directors of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") adopted amendments to the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan and the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan. A brief summary of each plan amendment follows.
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
On October 8, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan providing that no more benefits will accrue to plan participants as of December 31, 2008. Plan participants will continue to earn service for the purpose of becoming vested in the benefits they had accrued as of December 31, 2008. In addition, the amendment allows a plan participant to change from one type of life annuity to another type of life annuity provided they are actuarially equivalent and the election is received by the principal sponsor prior to the participant's separation from service.
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan
In October 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended the Internal Revenue Code to add section 409A ("Section 409A"), which imposes significant restrictions on nonqualified deferred compensation. In October 2006, the Company's Board of Directors approved amendments to the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan in order to bring the plan into compliance with Section 409A and proposed associated regulations. On October 8, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the First Amendment of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan (2005 Restatement) (the "DICP Amendment"), with provisions effective either as of January 1, 2008 or January 1, 2009, which contains additional amendments to the plan in order to bring the plan into compliance with the final regulations of Section 409A. Pursuant to the DICP Amendment, the benefits under the plan are subject to the following changes:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, the DICP Amendment merged the Restoration Plan with and into the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan
In October 2006, the Company's Board of Directors approved amendments to the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan in order to bring the plan into compliance with Section 409A and proposed associated regulations. At that time a decision was made to retain grandfathering for a large portion of the benefits earned under the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan. On October 8, 2008, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the First Amendment of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Partnership Plan (2005 Restatement), effective as of January 1, 2008, which did not retain grandfathering and caused all benefits to be subject to the rules of Section 409A. Pursuant to the amendment, the benefits under the plan are subject to the following changes:
 
 
 
 
Copies of the Third Amendment of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Officers' Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (2005 Restatement), the First Amendment of Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

Distribution of the Participant's Restoration Plan Account shall be made to the Participant or the Beneficiary entitled to receive distribution (the "Distributee") in one of the following ways as the Participant shall designate in writing prior to the first Plan Year in which the Participant first receives additions to the Participant's Accounts:
Forms Available
 
 
 
2.2.2. . The annual amount of each installment distribution required to be made for each calendar year (the "distribution year") shall be determined by dividing the amount of the Restoration Plan Account as of the last Valuation Date
Installment Amounts
 
in the calendar year immediately preceding the distribution year (such preceding calendar year being the "valuation year") by the number of remaining installment payments to be made (including the distribution being determined). The amount of the Restoration Plan Account as of such Valuation Date shall be increased by the amount of any contributions and forfeitures allocated to the Restoration Plan Account during the valuation year and after such Valuation Date (including contributions and forfeitures, if any, made after the end of the valuation year which are allocated as of dates in the valuation year). The amount of the Restoration Plan Account shall be decreased by the amount of any distributions made with respect to the valuation year but after such Valuation Date.
2.2.3. . If a Participant is reemployed by the Employer or an Affiliate after distribution has been made or commenced but before the Participant attains Normal Retirement Age, further distribution of the Participant's Restoration Plan Account shall be suspended and the undistributed remainder of the Restoration Plan Account shall continue to be held in the Fund until another Event of Maturity effective as to the Participant shall occur after the Participant's reemployment. It is the general intent of this Plan that no distributions shall be made before the Normal Retirement Age of a Participant while a Participant is employed by the Employer or an Affiliate.
Effect of Reemployment
2.3. . Distributions shall be considered to be substantially equal if the amount of the distribution required to be made for each calendar year (the "distribution year") is determined by dividing the amount of the Restoration Plan Account as of the last Valuation Date in the calendar year immediately preceding the distribution year (such preceding calendar year being the "valuation year") by the number of remaining installment payments to be made (including the distribution being determined). The amount of the Restoration Plan Account as of such Valuation Date shall be decreased by the amount of any distributions made in the valuation year and after such Valuation Date.
Substantially Equal
2.4. .
Designation of Beneficiaries
2.4.1. . Each Participant may designate, upon forms to be furnished by and filed with the Employer, one or more primary Beneficiaries or alternative Beneficiaries to receive all or a specified part of such Participant's Restoration Plan Account in the event of such Participant's death. The Participant may change or revoke any such designation from time to time without notice to or consent from any Beneficiary. No such designation, change or revocation shall be effective unless executed by the Participant and received by the Employer during the Participant's lifetime.
Right To Designate
2.4.2. . If a Participant:
Failure of Designation
 
 
 
such Participant's Restoration Plan Account, or the part thereof as to which such Participant's designation fails, as the case may be, shall be payable to the first class of the following classes of automatic Beneficiaries with a member surviving the Participant and (except in the case of surviving issue) in equal shares if there is more than one member in such class surviving the Participant:
Participant's surviving spouse
Participant's surviving issue per stirpes and not per capita
Participant's surviving parents
Participant's surviving brothers and sisters
Representative of Participant's estate.
2.4.3. . A Beneficiary entitled to a distribution of all or a portion of a deceased Participant's Restoration Plan Account may disclaim an interest therein subject to the following requirements. To be eligible to disclaim, a Beneficiary must be a natural person, must not have received a distribution of all or any portion of the Restoration Plan Account at the time such disclaimer is executed and delivered, and must have attained at least age twenty-one (21) years as of the date of the Participant's death. Any disclaimer must be in writing and must be executed personally by the Beneficiary before a notary public. A disclaimer shall state that the Beneficiary's entire interest in the undistributed Restoration Plan Account is disclaimed or shall specify what portion thereof is disclaimed. To be effective, duplicate original executed copies of the disclaimer must be both executed and actually delivered to the Employer after the date of the Participant's death but not later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the Participant's death. A disclaimer shall be irrevocable when delivered to the Employer. A disclaimer shall be considered to be delivered to the Employer only when actually received by the Employer. The Employer shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported disclaimer. Upon the filing of a valid disclaimer, the Beneficiary shall be considered not to have survived the Participant as to the interest disclaimed. A disclaimer by a Beneficiary shall not be considered to be a transfer of an interest in violation of the provisions of Section 8 and shall not be considered to be an assignment or alienation of benefits in violation of federal law prohibiting the assignment or alienation of benefits under this Plan. No other form of attempted disclaimer shall be recognized by the Employer.
Disclaimers by Beneficiaries
2.4.4. . When used herein and, unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, when used in a Beneficiary designation, "issue" means all persons who are lineal descendants of the person whose issue are referred to, including legally adopted descendants and their descendants but not including illegitimate
Definitions
 
descendants and their descendants; "child" means an issue of the first generation; "per stirpes" means in equal shares among living children of the person whose issue are referred to and the issue (taken collectively) of each deceased child of such person, with such issue taking by right of representation of such deceased child; and "survive" and "surviving" mean living after the death of the Participant.
2.4.5. . Unless the Participant has otherwise specified in the Participant's Beneficiary designation, the following rules shall apply:
Special Rules
 
 
 
 
 
A Beneficiary designation is permanently void if it either is executed or is filed by a Participant who, at the time of such execution or filing, is then a minor under the law of the state of the Participant's legal residence. The Employer shall be the sole judge of the content, interpretation and validity of a purported Beneficiary designation.
 
2.4.6. . No spouse or surviving spouse of a Participant and no person designated to be a Beneficiary shall have any rights or interest in the benefits accumulated under this Plan including, but not limited to, the right to be the sole Beneficiary or to consent to the designation of Beneficiaries (or the changing of designated Beneficiaries) by the Participant.
Spousal Rights
2.5. . If a Participant dies after an Event of Maturity but before distribution of such Participant's Restoration Plan Account has been completed, the remaining undistributed Restoration Plan Account shall be distributed in the same manner as hereinbefore provided in the Event of Maturity by reason of death. If, at the death of the Participant, any payment to the Participant was due or otherwise pending but not actually paid, the amount of such payment shall be included in the Restoration Plan Account which are payable to the Beneficiary (and shall not be paid to the Participant's estate).
Death Prior to Full Distribution
2.6. . In case of the legal disability, including minority, of a Participant or Beneficiary entitled to receive any distribution under the Plan, payment shall be made, if the Employer shall be advised of the existence of such condition:
Facility of Payment

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, December 17, 2008
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 17, 2008)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2009 third quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

Commentary
"Apogee's strong third-quarter performance is indicative of our earnings potential in strong market conditions," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our architectural businesses generally performed well on their healthy project backlog, which was booked an average of nine to 12 months ago and had good pricing and margins. Large-scale optical segment operating income increased as sales of our best value-added products to retail chains continued to grow.
"Although we expect future periods to be impacted by the commercial construction slowdown, we have entered the downturn with a very strong balance sheet," he said. "We are generating significant positive cash flow, our long-term debt has declined to less than $30 million, and we have a strong bank facility with available capacity."

OUTLOOK
"Our fiscal 2009 guidance for earnings from continuing operations remains at $1.65 to $1.82 per share, and includes declines in revenues and earnings per share in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year, as Apogee experiences the first full quarterly impact of the commercial construction slowdown," Huffer said. "Despite the anticipated fourth-quarter declines, we expect to complete fiscal 2009 with record revenues and earnings.
"To manage through the downturn, we have already implemented and continue to evaluate further cost cutting initiatives, ranging from reduction of headcount and discretionary spending to productivity improvements," he said. "We remain strongly focused on cash flow and managing working capital, and will tightly control capital expenditures. In addition, we are pursuing opportunities to generate revenues by penetrating underserved markets.
"Delays, cancellations and slower conversion of bid projects into awards have impacted the size of our backlog and have led to uncertainty regarding our outlook for fiscal 2010," Huffer said. "At this time, we estimate that our fiscal 2010 revenues are likely to be down at least 10 percent.
"As our third-quarter performance demonstrated, we have good businesses with strong brands and operations that are positioned to serve the growing demand for green, energy-efficient commercial

buildings. In addition, we have a very strong balance sheet," he said. "We anticipate that with our focus on quality, service and productivity improvements, our architectural segment will emerge stronger than ever after the economy strengthens."
The following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal 2009. These statements are forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The discussion above, including all statements in the Outlook section, contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove

to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 1, 2008.

First, borrowings under the Agreement may be made at an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin (which is calculated based upon the Company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio) and LIBOR (as defined in the Agreement). Second, borrowings under the Agreement may be made at an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of: (1) the Alternate Base Rate (which, prior to Amendment No. 2 described below, was a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) the interest rate announced by the administrative agent in The City of New York as its prime commercial loan rate in effect on such day and (y) the sum of 0.50% per annum and the federal funds rate in effect on such day) in effect from time to time, and (2) the Applicable Margin.

For Immediate Release
Monday, April 06, 2009
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (April 6, 2009)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2009 fourth quarter and full-year earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.

Commentary
"Apogee delivered record earnings and revenues for the third consecutive year in fiscal 2009, as the acquisition of the storefront and entrance business late in the prior year and the architectural glass business contributed to revenue growth," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "For the year, we achieved an operating margin of 8.4 percent, up from 7.5 percent the prior year, while paying off our bank debt as we generated significant free cash flow. Our operating performance, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2009, illustrates Apogee's potential in strong commercial construction markets.
"In fiscal 2009, the architectural segment benefitted from solid execution by the installation and window businesses of projects with good margins and mix, and good pricing in our architectural glass business, slightly offset by mid-year operational challenges in architectural glass," he said. "At the same time, our picture framing business delivered improved earnings as we continued to convert customers to our best value-added glass and acrylic products. Revenues for the large-scale optical segment decreased due to soft custom picture framing market conditions.
"Turning to the fourth quarter, we achieved strong operating margins and cash flow, despite slowing markets for our architectural and picture framing glass products that resulted in lower revenues," said Huffer. "As we manage through the economic downturn, we further reduced headcount and costs during the quarter.
"Although future periods will be impacted by the commercial construction slowdown, we have entered the downturn with a very strong balance sheet and are generating significant positive cash flow," he said. "Apogee is in its strongest financial condition in the decade that I've served as CEO."

OUTLOOK
"We are entering fiscal 2010 with an unprecedented level of uncertainty, and, as a result, will not be providing earnings per share and detailed annual guidance," Huffer said. "We expect continued profitability on revenues that will likely be down at least 15 percent. At this time, we are estimating operating margins in the mid-single digits as lower capacity utilization and competitive pricing are slightly offset by productivity improvements, and lower energy and some material costs." He noted, though, that the large-scale optical segment is expected to continue converting customers to value-added products through the downturn.
"We expect that the first half will be stronger than the second half of fiscal 2010, as we execute projects in our architectural backlog that were bid in stronger market conditions," Huffer said. "The second half could benefit from the addition of stimulus projects to upgrade government and school buildings that would incorporate our energy-efficient, green products and services; at this time, we have not secured any of these projects.
"To manage through the downturn, we have already implemented and continue to evaluate further cost cutting initiatives, ranging from reduction of headcount and discretionary spending to ongoing

productivity improvements," he said. "In addition, we are seeing early success in pursuing work in underserved architectural glass markets, including smaller and international projects. We also remain focused on delivering new energy-efficient glass products for the green building market.
"Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to have positive cash flow in fiscal 2010 as working capital declines and capital expenditures are less than $20 million," he said. "Our architectural segment businesses are also well positioned with the bonding capacity required by some contractors to assure completion of projects, a competitive strength in today's markets.
"As our fiscal 2009 second-half performance demonstrated, we have good architectural businesses with strong brands and operations that are positioned to serve the growing demand for green, energy-efficient commercial buildings," he said. "We anticipate that with our focus on quality, service and productivity improvements, Apogee will be well positioned when the economy improves."
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to utilize manufacturing facilities. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Bonus Pool Award Agreements
On April 28, 2009, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Bonus Pool Award Agreement with each of the named executive officers listed below, which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the executive officer may receive an annual bonus award under the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "Executive MIP"). The agreements provide that the executive officers' rights to receive annual cash bonus awards will be determined based on the attainment of certain pre-set goals for the fiscal year relating to specified performance metrics. The performance metrics to be used for determining awards under the Executive MIP for fiscal 2010 for the named executive officers listed below are net sales and earnings per share from continuing operations at the corporate level. In addition, Mr. Silvestri's award under the Executive MIP will be based on net sales and earnings before tax at the Viracon business unit level. For each of the performance metrics there is a threshold, target and maximum performance level. The table below sets forth certain information with respect to fiscal 2010 annual bonus award payout ranges as a percentage of fiscal 2010 salary for the named executive officers.
 
 
In the event an executive officer's employment is terminated during a fiscal year for any reason other than Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined in the agreement) or death, the agreement provides that the executive officer will forfeit any and all rights under the Executive MIP and the agreement relating to such fiscal year. In accordance with the agreement, if an executive officer's employment with the Company is terminated during the fiscal year as a result of Disability, Retirement or death, the executive officer, or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, will receive a pro-rata cash payment after the end of the fiscal year to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved.
The form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement used in connection with annual bonus awards under the Executive MIP is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference (the "Form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement").
 
Performance Share Unit and Restricted Stock Grants

Each Unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, subject to the vesting requirements described below.

The number of Units that will vest will be based on whether and to what extent the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics for the period commencing on March 1, 2009 and ending on March 3, 2012 (the "Performance Period") is achieved. The performance metrics for the Performance Period are average return on invested capital, cumulative earnings per share and market share growth. The Target Award Number will be increased to the Maximum Award Number set forth above if the Company's performance metrics are achieved at the maximum level or decreased to zero if none of the Company's performance metrics are achieved at the threshold performance level. The Threshold Award Number set forth above represents the number of Units that would vest if the Company achieves each performance metric at the threshold level.
In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated during the Performance Period, the Units shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited, unless the executive officer's termination is by reason of:
 
 
 
 
In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of involuntary termination without Cause, the executive officer shall be entitled to retain a pro-rata portion (based on the amount of time elapsed between the beginning of the Performance Period and the date of termination) of the Units after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of Early Retirement, Retirement, Disability or death, the executive officer or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, shall be entitled to retain the Units after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved. In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the agreement) prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Period shall be deemed to end on the date of the Change in Control and the executive officer shall be entitled to retain the Units to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved, as adjusted for the truncated Performance Period.
 
Time-Based Restricted Stock

The Committee shall retain sole and full discretion to reduce, in whole or in part, the amount of any Annual Bonus Pool Award otherwise payable to the Participant under the Plan. Payment of the Annual Bonus Pool Award may be made, subject to any deferred compensation election which may be permitted pursuant to any deferred compensation plan of the Company in which the Participant participates, at such times, with such restrictions and with such conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine at the time of the grant of the Annual Bonus Pool Award.

Such settlement shall be computed by:
(i) determining the Annual Bonus Pool Award at the end of the Performance Period that would have been earned if the Participant's employment had continued through the Performance Period, and
(ii) multiplying the result in (i) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full fiscal weeks in such Performance Period that the Participant was an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries and the denominator of which is the number of full fiscal weeks comprising the Performance Period.
Unless the Participant has delivered to the Company a beneficiary designation in a form acceptable to the Company, the cash settlement shall be made according to the laws of descent and distribution upon the death of the Participant.
(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Disability" is as defined in the Company's Tax Relief Investment Plan, as amended and restated from time to time.

Section 8. Nature of Payments
Any and all cash payments pursuant to any Annual Bonus Pool Award granted hereunder shall constitute special incentive payments to the Participant, and such payments shall not be taken into account in computing the amount of the Participant's salary or compensation for purposes of determining any pension, retirement, death or other benefits under (i) any pension, retirement, profit sharing, bonus, life insurance or other employee benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate or (ii) any agreement between the Company (or any Affiliate) and the Participant, except to the extent that such plan or agreement expressly provides to the contrary.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Tuesday, June 23, 2009
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 23, 2009)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2010 first quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY10 FIRST-QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"Apogee's first-quarter revenues and earnings per share declined as domestic market conditions worsened with continued tight commercial real estate credit, decreasing employment levels and soft retail markets," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We are managing costs and productivity to achieve solid gross margins, and are generating cash in this tough environment. However, the inability to fully leverage fixed costs over lower volume impacted our architectural and large-scale optical segment operating margins.
"It is positive that we experienced a relatively flat architectural segment backlog compared to the previous quarter and minimal cancellations," said Huffer. "In addition, we continue to convert customers to our value-added custom picture framing products.

"We have reduced costs more than $40 million on an annual basis since October and headcount continues to decrease," he said. "Although future periods will be impacted by the domestic commercial construction slowdown, we entered the downturn with a very strong balance sheet and are generating positive cash flow. Apogee remains in a strong financial position."

OUTLOOK
"We are facing an unprecedented level of uncertainty in fiscal 2010, with commercial real estate markets still largely frozen and declining domestic employment levels," Huffer said. "We expect
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.
Page 3
 
continued profitability on revenues that will be down at least 15 percent  we are seeing early success in pursuing work in underserved, shorter-lead time architectural glass markets, including smaller and international projects, and our architectural segment bidding activity remains strong although already slow bid-to-award timing extended in the quarter.
"We are estimating operating margins in the mid-single digits as lower capacity utilization and competitive pricing are slightly offset by productivity improvements and lower energy costs." He noted, though, that the large-scale optical segment is expected to continue converting customers to value-added products.
"To manage through the downturn, we have significantly cut costs and continue to evaluate further reductions in headcount and discretionary spending, combined with ongoing productivity improvements," he said. "Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to have positive cash flow in fiscal 2010 as working capital declines and capital expenditures are less than $20 million. Our architectural segment businesses are well positioned with the bonding capacity required by some contractors to assure completion of projects, a competitive strength in today's markets.
"We still expect to benefit from the addition of stimulus projects to upgrade government and school buildings that would incorporate our energy-efficient, green products and services, although it may not be until fiscal 2011," Huffer said. "Introducing additional energy-efficient products for new and renovation commercial construction markets continues to be a focus for Apogee during the economic slowdown.
"We have good architectural businesses with strong brands and operations that are positioned to serve the growing interest in green, energy-efficient commercial buildings," he said. "We anticipate that with our focus on quality, service and productivity improvements, Apogee will be well positioned when the economy improves."
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the

extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

The 2009 Incentive Plan permits grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards, stock awards and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards") to employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors of the Company. The Company's Board of Directors and Compensation Committee have the authority to determine the type of Award as well as the amount, terms and conditions of each Award under the 2009 Incentive Plan, subject to the limitations and other provisions of the 2009 Incentive Plan.
The purpose of the 2009 Incentive Plan is to promote the interests of the Company and its shareholders by (1) aiding the Company in attracting and retaining management personnel capable of providing strategic direction to, and assuring the future success of, the Company and (2) motivating such persons to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Company's business. The 2009 Incentive Plan allows the Company to compensate such persons through various stock-based arrangements and provide them with opportunities for stock ownership in the Company, thereby aligning the interests of such persons with the Company's shareholders.
A total of 1,400,000 shares of the Company's common stock is authorized for the granting of Awards under the 2009 Incentive Plan.

NEWS RELEASE
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, September 16, 2009
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 16, 2009)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2010 second quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY10 SECOND QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"Apogee achieved strong operating performance and exceeded prior-year earnings per share on revenues that were down consistent with the decline in the commercial construction market, which continues to be impacted by tight commercial real estate credit and decreasing employment levels," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "As we executed work largely bid in stronger markets, we operated well, improved productivity, managed costs and generated cash.

"It is also positive that our architectural segment backlog was down only slightly compared to the previous two quarters," said Huffer. "In addition, our picture framing business performed well, growing revenues and operating income in the quarter as it continues to convert customers to our best value-added framing products.
"Our second-quarter performance shows our agility in adapting to the downturn as well as our ability to operate through a commercial construction cycle," he said. "Although future periods will be impacted by the construction slowdown, we are in a strong financial position  we have a healthy balance sheet and are generating positive cash flow."

OUTLOOK
"Our solid performance to date in these challenging economic times supports our outlook for continued profitability," Huffer said. "For fiscal 2010, we continue to expect a mid-single digit operating margin on revenues that we anticipate will be down 20 to 25 percent as project timing for new orders has shifted into fiscal 2011. We had previously anticipated fiscal 2010 revenues would decline at least 15 percent." He added that the large-scale optical segment is expected to continue converting customers to higher value-added products.
"Since Apogee is a late cycle commercial construction company and our markets have yet to show signs of a rebound, we expect that fiscal 2011 will be tougher than the current year," he said. "We are seeing some success in filling in backlog for fiscal 2011, and believe we are well positioned financially and in the marketplace, especially with our leading green, energy-efficient building products.
"We are seeing early success in pursuing work in underserved, shorter-lead time architectural glass markets, including smaller and international projects, which is benefitting fiscal 2010, and have won a few stimulus projects incorporating our energy-efficient products and services, although most of this work is scheduled for fiscal 2011," said Huffer.
"To manage through the downturn, we have reduced costs more than $45 million on an annualized basis since last October and continue to evaluate further reductions in headcount and discretionary spending; we are also working continuously on productivity improvements," he said. "Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to generate positive cash flow throughout fiscal 2010.
"We have good architectural businesses with strong brands and operations that are positioned to serve the growing interest in green, energy-efficient commercial buildings," he said. "Apogee will be well positioned when commercial construction markets improve  we have people and capacities in place to profitably grow for several years."
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental

regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Wednesday, December 16, 2009
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 16, 2009)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2010 third quarter earnings. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY10 THIRD QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"In difficult market conditions, Apogee achieved solid operating performance as we improved productivity and aggressively managed costs," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "We also generated approximately $40 million of cash flow from operating activities in the third quarter.
"Revenues and earnings were down, though, as the non-residential construction market continues to be impacted by tight commercial real estate credit and decreasing employment levels," he said. "Earnings were also impacted by low capacity utilization and the declining mix of work bid in stronger commercial construction markets.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

"Operating income for our picture framing business grew in the seasonally strongest quarter as new and ongoing value-added product customers continue to convert to our best framing products," said Huffer. "The business is also benefitting as it leverages the significant investments made over the last two years.
"The third quarter demonstrates our focus on operating well through this challenging commercial construction downturn," he said. "And, although our markets are down significantly, we're seeing success in winning institutional projects, including stimulus work, and our share of large projects that are going forward, as well as smaller domestic projects, international work and installation projects in new geographies."

"We have delivered a solid performance to date during these challenging economic times," Huffer said. "For the fiscal 2010 full year, we are anticipating a revenue decline of 22 to 24 percent and an operating margin of 6.3 to 7 percent.
"Since Apogee is a late cycle commercial construction company and our markets are showing signs of a longer downturn than had been anticipated, we expect that fiscal 2011 will be tougher than the current year," he said. "We are seeing some success in filling in backlog for fiscal 2011, although at more competitive prices and margins. We believe that our architectural segment is well positioned to continue to gain share by leveraging our brands, national presence, quality, service levels and financial strength.
"To manage through the downturn, we have reduced costs more than $55 million on an annualized basis since last October and continue to evaluate further reductions in headcount and discretionary spending; we are also working continuously on productivity improvements," said Huffer. "Our balance sheet remains strong, and we expect to continue to generate positive operating cash flow in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2011.
"We are confident that we have the financial strength to weather the expected ongoing weak market conditions and to focus on our growth strategy for the recovery," he said. "Our architectural businesses have strong brands and operations that are positioned to serve the growing interest in green, energy-efficient commercial buildings, while our picture framing business continues to successfully convert customers to its industry-leading framing products."

"Although we experienced difficult market conditions during fiscal 2010, Apogee achieved solid operating performance and our third highest earnings ever, as we worked off backlog booked in stronger markets and focused on improving productivity and aggressively managing costs," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "During the year, we also generated $97 million of cash flow from operating activities, further strengthening our balance sheet.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

"Architectural segment revenues were down comparable to our markets served, which have been impacted by tight commercial real estate credit and depressed employment levels," he said. "Earnings declined due to low architectural segment capacity utilization, declining pricing and the decreasing mix of work bid in stronger commercial construction markets as the year progressed.
"Our picture framing business maintained revenues and operating income in weak retail market conditions as new and ongoing value-added product customers continued to convert to our best framing products during fiscal 2010," said Huffer. "The business is also benefitting operationally as it leverages the significant investments made over the last two years.
"Turning to the fourth quarter, we generated cash from operations and again reduced costs as the architectural segment fully felt the impact of the commercial construction downturn, with further volume and pricing declines resulting in a quarterly loss for the segment," he said, adding that segment capacity utilization was at its lowest level in this decade.
"As we have been stating, fiscal 2011 will be very challenging for our architectural businesses," Huffer said. "We are well positioned financially; have leading products, services and brands; and remain focused on operational and strategic initiatives to strengthen our business for the rebound in our markets."

OUTLOOK
"We expect that our architectural segment will be increasingly challenged through much of fiscal 2011," Huffer said. "Apogee is a late cycle commercial construction company and our markets are showing signs of a longer downturn than originally anticipated. In addition, we've worked off the majority of projects booked in stronger markets.
"Given the limited visibility for our architectural markets as we enter fiscal 2011, we are estimating companywide revenues for the year will be down 10 to 15 percent, and we believe we have the potential for positive earnings per share," he said. "We anticipate that earnings from our large-scale optical segment will offset losses in our architectural segment, where we expect the second half will be stronger than the first half.
"Our revenue outlook is somewhat better than the forecasts for our markets," Huffer explained. "Adjusting the McGraw-Hill forecast for our lag to the market as well as the sectors we serve, our markets are expected to be down 15-20 percent for fiscal 2011.
"We have been adding work to our backlog, although at more competitive prices and margins, as we capture energy-efficient work in the institutional sector and installation projects in new geographies while successfully penetrating underserved smaller project and international markets for architectural glass," he said. "Although the needed improvement in employment and credit markets has not yet occurred, we believe we are beginning to see early signs of positive movement in our business.
"We have focused on making our business as competitive as possible in difficult market conditions. We have aggressively reduced costs by more than $57 million on an annualized basis over the last year and a half, and are working continuously on productivity improvements," Huffer said. "At the same time, we are maintaining capacity and people to respond to potential growth in fiscal 2012, and continue to focus on longer-term strategies to expand our energy-efficient architectural glass offerings both domestically and internationally. Architectural glass strategic investments could expand our capital needs as soon as fiscal 2011 and reduce cash flow this year.
"We have the financial strength to weather the expected ongoing weak market conditions and continue to focus on our growth strategy for the recovery," he said. "Our architectural businesses have strong brands and operations that are well positioned to serve the aesthetic, energy-efficient, hurricane- and blast-resistant glass requirements for commercial buildings, while our picture framing business continues to successfully convert customers to its industry-leading framing products."

(e) Bonus Pool Award Agreements
On April 27, 2010, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Bonus Pool Award Agreement with each of the named executive officers listed below, which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the executive officer may receive an annual bonus award under the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "Executive MIP"). The agreements provide that the executive officers' rights to receive annual cash bonus awards will be determined based on the attainment of certain pre-set goals for the fiscal year relating to specified performance metrics. The performance metrics to be used for determining awards under the Executive MIP for fiscal 2011 for the named executive officers listed below are net sales and earnings per share from continuing operations at the corporate level. In addition, Mr. Silvestri's award under the Executive MIP will be based on net sales and earnings before taxes at the Viracon business unit level. For each of the performance metrics there is a threshold, target and maximum performance level. The table below sets forth certain information with respect to fiscal 2011 annual bonus award payout ranges as a percentage of fiscal 2011 salary for the named executive officers.
 
 
In the event an executive officer's employment is terminated during a fiscal year for any reason other than Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined in the agreement) or death, the agreement provides that the executive officer will forfeit any and all rights under the Executive MIP and the agreement relating to such fiscal year. In accordance with the agreement, if an executive officer's employment with the Company is terminated during the fiscal year as a result of Disability, Retirement or death, the executive officer, or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, will receive a pro-rata cash payment after the end of the fiscal year to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved.
The form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement used in connection with annual bonus awards under the Executive MIP, a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2009 (the "Form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement"), is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Performance Share Unit and Restricted Stock Grants
Performance Share Units
On April 27, 2010, the Company's Compensation Committee awarded to the named executive officers listed below performance share unit awards entitling the executive officers to the number of performance share units (the "Units") equal to the target number of shares set forth below (the "Target Award Number").
 
Each Unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, subject to the vesting requirements described below. The Units were awarded pursuant to the shareholder-approved Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2009 Stock Incentive Plan"), a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 4.5 to the Company's Form S-8 filed on June 24, 2009. The form of Performance Share Unit Agreement used in connection with performance share unit awards under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, including the awards to the executive officers listed above, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference (the "Form of 2009 Stock Incentive Plan Performance Share Unit Agreement").
The number of Units that will vest will be based on whether and to what extent the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics for the period commencing on February 28, 2010 and ending on March 2, 2013 (the "Performance Period") is achieved. The performance metrics for the Performance Period are average return on invested capital, cumulative earnings per share and market share growth. The Target Award Number will be increased to the Maximum Award Number set forth above if the Company's performance metrics are achieved at the maximum level or decreased to zero if none of the Company's performance metrics are achieved at the threshold performance level. The Threshold Award Number set forth above represents the number of Units that would vest if the Company achieved each performance metric at the threshold level.
In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated during the Performance Period, the Units shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited, unless the executive officer's termination is by reason of:
 
 
 
 
In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of involuntary termination without Cause, the executive officer shall be entitled to retain a pro-rata portion (based on the amount of time elapsed between the beginning of the Performance Period and the date of termination) of the Units after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved and as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of Retirement, Disability or death, the executive officer or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, shall be entitled to retain the Units after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved and as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan) prior to the end of
 
the Performance Period, the Performance Period shall be deemed to end on the date of the Change in Control and the executive officer shall be entitled to retain the Units to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved, as adjusted for the truncated Performance Period, and as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion.
Time-Based Restricted Stock

"Lois is a key contributor to Capella's unique culture. While her leadership, expertise and thoughtful guidance will be greatly missed at Capella, I respect her decision to focus on personal interests and wish her the very best in her future," said Kevin Gilligan, chairman and chief executive officer. "Lois' contributions to our mission of delivering quality and value to both learners and shareholders are well-recognized and greatly appreciated. We are fortunate that Lois has developed a deep, highly talented team and an underlying infrastructure to support our continued growth. Lois' commitment to a planful transition process and her willingness to be available beyond her departure date demonstrates her passion and dedication to Capella. As a result, I am confident that the transition will be completed successfully."
"Working with all of the people at Capella has been an extraordinary experience," said Lois Martin, chief financial officer. "Since joining the company in 2004, I have taken great pride in the tremendous accomplishments of our learners, and the commitment and effort of our faculty and employees. Capella is stronger and better positioned than it ever has been to continue to be a leader in online education and to extend its track record of success even further. While this was not an easy decision for me, this is the right time for me to focus on other priorities and interests, given the significant accomplishments we've made and the strength of the business. Looking forward, I will enjoy spending more time with my family; however, my near term priority remains with the institution, ensuring a seamless and successful CFO transition."
Ms. Martin will remain full-time in her current role with the Company through year-end 2010, while a search is completed to fill the CFO position.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Tuesday, June 22, 2010
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 22, 2010)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2011 first-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY11 FIRST QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"As we expected, fiscal 2011 started out to be extremely challenging due to the tough commercial construction market conditions," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our strategy to manage our business over a cycle has allowed us to establish a strong balance sheet, with cash on hand. This positions us well during these difficult markets.
"Architectural segment revenues were down comparable to our markets served, which have been impacted by tight commercial real estate credit and depressed employment levels," he said. "First-quarter architectural segment losses were the result of low pricing and low volume, although our manufacturing operations and installation project execution performed well.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

"Our picture framing business grew revenues and operating income in weak retail market conditions as new and ongoing value-added product customers continued to convert to our best framing products," said Huffer.
"Although fiscal 2011 will be difficult for our architectural businesses, we are well positioned financially; have leading products, services and brands; and remain focused on operational and strategic initiatives to strengthen our business for the rebound in our markets," Huffer said.

OUTLOOK
"Fiscal 2011 will be challenging for our architectural segment," Huffer said. "As a late-cycle commercial construction company, Apogee lags its markets.
"We continue to estimate that companywide revenues for the year will be down 10 to 15 percent," he said. "We now anticipate a loss for the year for Apogee, as lower than expected architectural glass pricing will likely continue through fiscal 2011. Expected earnings in our large-scale optical segment will be unable to offset architectural losses. We continue to expect that the second half will be stronger than the first half for Apogee.
"Neither our current outlook nor our reported results reflect the potential impact of the recent discovery of architectural glass product quality issues resulting from a vendor-supplied material used in a portion of first-quarter production," Huffer said. "We are in the process of addressing the quality issues and attempting to quantify the related costs.
"We have been adding work to our backlog, although at reduced prices and margins due to competitive pressures. We are capturing energy-efficient, complex value-added work in the institutional sector including installation projects in new geographies, while successfully penetrating underserved smaller project and international markets for architectural glass," Huffer said. "As employment and credit markets are starting to improve, we believe we are beginning to see early signs of positive movement in our business.
"We have focused on making our business as competitive as possible in difficult market conditions. We have reduced costs, and are working continuously on productivity improvements," he said. "At the same time, we are maintaining capacity and people to respond to potential growth in fiscal 2012, and continue to focus on longer-term strategies to expand our energy-efficient architectural glass offerings both domestically and internationally. Architectural glass strategic investments could expand our capital needs and impact cash flow this fiscal year.
"We have the financial strength to weather the weak market conditions and continue to focus on our growth strategy for the recovery," Huffer said. "Our architectural businesses have strong brands and operations that are well positioned to serve the aesthetic, energy-efficient, hurricane- and blast-resistant glass requirements for commercial buildings, while our picture framing business continues to successfully convert customers to its industry-leading framing products."

These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American commercial construction industry; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit

availability; iii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

NEWS RELEASE
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, September 15, 2010
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 15, 2010)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2011 second-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY11 SECOND QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"Our results are being impacted by extremely challenging commercial construction market conditions with low pricing and tight project margins," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our strategy to manage our business over a cycle has positioned us to sustain these losses while maintaining a strong balance sheet and cash on hand. At the end of the quarter, our cash and short-term investment level remained at approximately $70 million.
"Second-quarter architectural segment revenues declined at rates comparable to our markets served, while architectural segment operating losses were primarily the result of low architectural glass pricing on lower volume," he said, noting that manufacturing operations and installation project execution performed well.

"We continue to see weakness in overall non-residential construction markets," Huffer said. "Although our second-quarter architectural backlog declined compared to the first quarter, a significant amount of work, primarily scheduled for fiscal 2012, has been awarded to us and is awaiting contract signing before being added to backlog.
"Our picture framing business grew revenues slightly and maintained a strong operating margin in soft retail market conditions as new and ongoing value-added product customers continued to convert to our best framing products," said Huffer.
"Although fiscal 2011 will be extremely difficult for our architectural businesses, we are well positioned financially; have leading products, services and brands; and remain focused on operational and strategic initiatives to strengthen our business for the rebound in our markets," he said.

"Fiscal 2011 will continue to be challenging for our architectural segment, given tough commercial construction market conditions and the fact that Apogee is a late-cycle company and lags the markets," Huffer said. "Our outlook for fiscal 2012 is more positive  we expect that recent architectural glass price increases along with the forecasted beginning of a market recovery should allow us to return to profitability for the full fiscal year.
"We estimate that companywide revenues for fiscal 2011 will be down approximately 15 percent," he said. "We anticipate a loss for the second half of the year as expected earnings in our large-scale optical segment will be unable to offset architectural losses. We expect to have positive cash flow from operations in the second half of the year.
"Our current outlook takes into account the architectural glass product quality issues resulting from a vendor-supplied material," Huffer said. "We are in the process of quantifying any additional impact, which we don't expect will be material.
"We are focused on making our business as competitive as possible in difficult market conditions. We recently increased prices where possible, and are working continuously on productivity improvements," he said. "We are capturing energy-efficient, complex value-added work in the institutional sector, including installation projects in new geographies, and the limited number of available large commercial projects. In addition, we are gaining share in previously underserved smaller project and international markets for architectural glass.
"At the same time, we are maintaining architectural capacity and people to respond to potential growth in fiscal 2012," he said. "We also continue to focus on longer-term strategies to expand our energy-efficient products and architectural glass international penetration.
"We believe we have the financial strength to weather the weak market conditions and will continue to focus on our growth strategy for the recovery," Huffer said.

(e) Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan
On October 6, 2010, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") adopted the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan (the "2011 Deferred Compensation Plan"). The 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan, which becomes effective on January 1, 2011, is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for a select group of management and other highly compensated employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. Approximately 160 of the Company's employees, including all of the Company's named executive officers, will be eligible to participate in the 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan for the 2011 calendar year.
The 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan allows for deferrals by participants of up to 75% of base salary and sales commissions and up to 100% of bonuses and other cash or equity-based compensation approved by the Company's Compensation Committee. The 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan also provides that the Company may establish rules permitting a participant to defer performance-based compensation up to six months prior to the end of a performance period. For the 2011 calendar year, participants in the 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan may elect to defer base salary, sales commissions, bonuses and other cash compensation. There is no maximum dollar limit on the amount that may be deferred by a participant each year. Participants in the 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan will elect to have the participant's account credited with earnings and investment gains and losses by assuming that deferred amounts were invested in one or more hypothetical investment options selected by the participant. An Apogee common stock fund will not be one of the investment options available under the 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan. Participants are permitted to change their investment elections at any time. The Company may also make discretionary contributions to a participant's account under the 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan, and the Company will designate a vesting schedule for each such contribution. The participants are always 100% vested in the amount they defer and the earnings, gains and losses credited to their accounts.
Participants are entitled to receive a distribution from their account upon: a separation from service, a specified date, death, disability, retirement (as defined in the 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan), or unforeseeable emergency that results in "severe financial hardship" that is consistent with the meaning of such term under section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Distributions are in a lump sum, installments or a combination of lump sum with installments based upon the participant's election as allowed under the 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan.
The 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded obligation of the Company, and participants are unsecured creditors of the Company.
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan (2005 Restatement)
On October 6, 2010, the Company adopted the Third Amendment of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan (2005 Restatement) (the "DICP Amendment"), with provisions effective as of January 1, 2011, which:
 
 
 
Termination of Change-in-Control Severance Agreements
In 2008, the Company entered into change-in-control severance agreements with each of its executive officers. The agreements continue through December 31 of each year and provide that they are to be automatically extended in one-year increments unless the Company gives prior notice of termination. As part of its annual review of the severance agreements, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors determined to terminate the agreements, effective as of December 31, 2010, and instructed that notice of termination be provided to the Company's executive officers by September 30, 2010 in accordance with the terms of the agreements. The Company expects to offer to certain of the Company's executive officers new change-in-control severance agreements containing different terms to be effective on January 1, 2011. A Current Report on Form 8-K describing the new change-in-control agreements will be filed with the SEC in accordance with the SEC's rules.
Copies of the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan and the Third Amendment of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan (2005 Restatement) are attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. The descriptions in this Current Report on Form 8-K of the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2011 Deferred Compensation Plan and the Third Amendment of Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

RTICLE
Establishment and Purpose
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") hereby establishes the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"), effective January 1, 2011. The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain key employees by providing Participants with an opportunity to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and other specified compensation. The Plan is not intended to meet the qualification requirements of Code Section 401(a), but is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 409A, and shall be operated and interpreted consistent with that intent.
The Plan constitutes an unsecured promise by a Participating Employer to pay benefits in the future. Participants in the Plan shall have the status of general unsecured creditors of the Company or the Adopting Employer, as applicable. Each Participating Employer shall be solely responsible for payment of the benefits of its employees and their beneficiaries. The Plan is unfunded for federal tax purposes and is intended to be an unfunded arrangement for eligible employees who are part of a select group of management or highly compensated employees of the Employer within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. Any amounts set aside to defray the liabilities assumed by the Company or an Adopting Employer will remain the general assets of the Company or the Adopting Employer and shall remain subject to the claims of the Company's or the Adopting Employer's creditors until such amounts are distributed to the Participants.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Friday, November 19, 2010
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (November 19, 2010)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced that it has acquired 100 percent of the stock of Glassec Vidros de Segurana Ltda., the leading architectural glass fabricator in Brazil, for approximately $22 million U.S. plus assumption of approximately $2 million in debt. The business will be called Glassec Viracon and operate as part of Apogee's architectural glass business; its results will be reported in Apogee's architectural segment.
"The purchase of Glassec, with annual revenues of approximately $30 million, is part of Apogee's strategy to increase our architectural glass penetration in international markets," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Glassec Viracon will give Apogee entre to a large developing market for energy-efficient architectural glass products that is difficult to serve from the United States.
"We expect that the Glassec Viracon business will have operating margins consistent with our architectural segment operating margins over the cycle, and believe it could be accretive to Apogee's earnings as early as fiscal 2012," said Huffer. "We are pleased that the management team will remain to lead Glassec Viracon to even greater levels of performance. Glassec Viracon, which has a strategy similar to that of Viracon, focuses on serving complex commercial building projects with high-quality, energy-efficient architectural glass. It has provided glass for a number of high-profile projects in Brazil."
"We're pleased to be joining a financially-strong, global leader in glass fabrication," said Dario Abraho Farhat, general manager of Glassec Viracon. "We are looking forward to capitalizing on the synergies of the two companies and drawing on Viracon's expertise to better serve our customers and expand our market share in Brazil and Latin America. In addition, joining the Viracon family will provide more opportunities for our employees and our customers."

All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Brazilian commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and v) integration of the Glassec Viracon business; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity.

For Immediate Release
Wednesday, December 15, 2010
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 15, 2010)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2011 third-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY11 THIRD QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"Although our results continue to be impacted by extremely challenging commercial construction market conditions, we remain focused on our strategies and longer-term opportunities for Apogee," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chairman and chief executive officer. "Our purchase of a leading architectural glass fabricator in Brazil during the quarter gives Apogee entre to the large developing market for energy-efficient architectural glass products in Latin America. Despite a difficult quarter, we have maintained a strong balance sheet, with more than $45 million in cash and short-term investments after funding the acquisition.
"Third-quarter architectural segment revenues declined year over year but improved slightly from the second quarter as overall non-residential construction markets remain stagnant; we incurred architectural segment operating losses primarily due to low architectural glass pricing and low volume in the
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.
Page 2
 
segment," he said. "Our third-quarter reported architectural backlog declined compared to the second quarter; however, the total of our backlog along with the dollar value of awarded projects awaiting final signed contracts was comparable to the second quarter level.
"Our picture framing business maintained revenues and strong operating income in our seasonally strongest quarter as customers continued to utilize our best value-added framing products," said Huffer.
"Despite the ongoing extremely difficult conditions for our architectural businesses, we believe that we are well positioned for the eventual rebound in our markets with our strong balance sheet, leading green energy-efficient products, and operational and strategic initiatives," he said.

OUTLOOK
"We estimate that companywide revenues for fiscal 2011 will be down approximately 17 percent, with fourth-quarter revenues comparable to the prior-year period," Huffer said. "We anticipate a loss for the fourth quarter and the full year, as expected earnings in our large-scale optical segment will be unable to offset architectural segment losses. We expect fourth-quarter cash flow from operations will be flat to slightly positive, despite a challenging quarter where we anticipate tough pricing in architectural glass on volumes expected to be down from the third quarter.
"Looking to fiscal 2012, we are expecting to be profitable for the year as architectural glass price increases should begin to flow through early in the year," he said. "We don't anticipate much help from our markets, which are not expected to show significant improvement until later in calendar 2011, given that Apogee is a very late cycle company that lags commercial construction markets by several months.
"We continue to book new orders for fiscal 2012 and beyond," Huffer said. "Even though our reported backlog declined in the third quarter, the total of our backlog along with the dollar value of awarded projects awaiting final signed contracts before being added to backlog held steady compared to the second quarter.
"At this time, we are maintaining architectural capacity and people to be well positioned for growth when our markets improve," he said. "We are focused on increasing pricing and productivity where possible, while reducing costs. We also continue to work on longer-term strategies to expand our energy-efficient products and architectural glass international penetration, including in Latin American markets with the Glassec acquisition.
"We believe we have the financial strength to weather the weak market conditions," Huffer said. "In the meantime, we are capturing energy-efficient, complex value-added work in the institutional sector, including installation projects in new geographies, and the limited number of available large commercial projects."

(b) The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") develops succession plans for members of the Company's senior management team. As part of this process, the Board has been engaged in ongoing discussions with Russell Huffer, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, regarding Mr. Huffer's service as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. On January 19, 2011, at a regularly scheduled Board meeting, Mr. Huffer informed the Board that he intends to retire from the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company by the end of fiscal 2012, but will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer until his successor is elected by the Board. The Board has formed a search committee, which intends to engage a search firm with the goal of identifying Mr. Huffer's successor no later than the end of the Company's 2012 fiscal year.
CEO Retirement.
In connection with the impending leadership changes, the Board determined to separate the Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions. On January 19, 2011, Mr. Huffer agreed to step down as Chair of the Board. Mr. Huffer will continue to serve as a member of the Board. On January 19, 2011, the Board elected Bernard P. Aldrich, a current director of the Company, to the position of Non-Executive Chair of the Board to serve until the next annual meeting of the Company's shareholders.The Board also adopted roles and responsibilities for the Non-Executive Chair position and determined to pay Mr. Aldrich, in lieu of all other cash fees paid to non-employee directors, at the rate of $100,000 per year for his service as Non-Executive Chair of the Board. Because the Company now has an independent Chair of the Board, the Board eliminated the Lead Director position and Stephen Mitchell ceased serving in that role effective January 19, 2011. In addition, Mr. Aldrich stepped down as Chair of the Board's Compensation Committee, and the Board elected David E. Weiss, a current member of the Board and that Committee, to serve as Chair of that Committee, effective January 19, 2011.
Chair of the Board.
For his services in fiscal 2012, Mr. Huffer will continue to receive a base salary of $700,000 per year and will be eligible to receive a bonus under the Company's Amended and Restated Executive Management Incentive Plan. The Board has determined not to grant any performance-based, long-term equity incentive awards to Mr. Huffer for fiscal 2012.
Fiscal 2012 Compensation.
The Board and Mr. Huffer have agreed that, upon Mr. Huffer's retirement as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Huffer will receive $1,225,000 in cash, which is equal to his current annual base salary plus his target bonus for fiscal 2011. In addition, the Company will pay Mr. Huffer approximately $21,000, representing the excess cost to Mr. Huffer of receiving COBRA health benefits for the 18-month period following his cessation as an employee of the Company, and approximately $11,000, representing the projected cost to Mr. Huffer of health insurance premiums following the expiration of the COBRA period until Mr. Huffer attains the age of 65. The Company further agreed to provide Mr. Huffer with outplacement assistance, at a cost of up to a maximum amount of $50,000. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated 2002 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, 2009 Stock Incentive Plan and related award agreements, the Board agreed to accelerate the vesting of a total of 45,542 shares of time-based restricted common stock of the Company held by Mr. Huffer that is due to vest in April 2012 and April 2013. In consideration of the foregoing, Mr. Huffer agreed to provide consulting services to the Company for a period of one-year following his retirement, and to enter into a general release of the Company from any and all claims and causes of action of any kind that he has or may have had against the Company. In addition, pursuant to provisions contained in various award agreements and pension plans of the Company, Mr. Huffer will continue to be prohibited from competing with the Company for a period of two years following his last date of employment with the Company.
Separation Payments.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, January 19, 2011
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (January 19, 2011)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Russell Huffer will retire, pending the naming of a successor. The board of directors of Apogee will immediately initiate a national search for his successor. He will remain CEO until the search is completed. Huffer, 61, is also stepping down from his position as chairman, effective immediately. The board has named current director Bernard P. Aldrich to replace Huffer as non-executive chairman. Huffer will continue to serve on the board of directors until a new CEO is named.
"We are grateful to Russ for his leadership as CEO over the past 13 years and for helping to create a logical succession plan for this transition," said Aldrich. "Russ' selfless dedication to Apogee over the course of the past quarter century is unique in today's business environment, so it comes as no surprise to the board that he has decided that now is the appropriate time to start the leadership transition. Russ has accomplished a great deal during his tenure as CEO, including the strategic realignment of the company's businesses, strong capital management, establishing Apogee's businesses as quality and service brands and positioning the company for profitable growth. Russ is responsible for much of the fundamental science that drives our industry  such as products with energy-efficient coatings for the commercial construction industry  and Apogee has benefitted from his many patents and continual focus on innovation. His legacy here will be a strong company that is well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities."
Huffer was elected Apogee chairman in June 1999, after having been elected president and CEO in January 1998. He joined Apogee in 1986 as vice president and general manager of Viracon, Apogee's largest subsidiary and the leading fabricator of coated, high-performance architectural glass for global markets. During Huffer's time as CEO, on a comparable basis, revenues in Apogee's core business rose significantly, from approximately $580 million in his first fiscal year as CEO to more than $925 million at their height in 2009. He also was responsible for realignment of the company's business

strategy and generating more than $600 million of cash flow from operations, during his tenure as CEO. This has moved the company from high debt to net cash, while enabling significant investment levels.
"I've witnessed a great deal of change in my 25 years with Apogee," Huffer said. "But one constant has been my passion for this industry, this company and these employees. It's that same dedication that has me stepping aside at the appropriate time for me and for the company. I feel I'm leaving Apogee in a position to accomplish great things. The timing is right for a new leader to assume the reins, as the global economy accelerates its recovery. I can now hand off a company positioned to capitalize on its strong foundation, as it heads into a new, promising economic era."
As chairman and CEO, Huffer has overseen the strategic realignment of Apogee from its roots in the after-market auto glass industry to a provider of value-added glass solutions for commercial buildings and framing art. He also spearheaded the company's successful adoption of Lean Six Sigma improvement processes that have reduced costs and improved operating efficiencies throughout the company. He has worked directly on three patented low-emissivity (energy-efficient) glass coatings and developed reflective high-performance glass coatings, all for use on commercial buildings, and he continued his focus on product development and developing a culture of innovation throughout his tenure.
Before joining Apogee, Huffer spent six years in various management positions with Guardian Industries' coatings, float glass and glass fabrication divisions. Previous to that, he spent two years as a senior designer at Ford Motor Company and seven years in the U.S. Air Force.
Effective immediately, current director Bernard P. Aldrich has been named non-executive chairman, to replace Huffer. Aldrich, a member of Apogee's board of directors since 1999, is the retired chief executive officer and president of Rimage Corporation, a publicly-held designer and manufacturer of workflow integrated digital publishing solutions. He has also served as chair of Apogee's compensation committee and as a member of its nominating and corporate governance committee. Aldrich, 61, retired from Rimage in 2009 after 12 years as president and CEO. He has 13 years of public company operational experience and 18 years of private company financial management experience, to go along with his expertise in manufacturing operations.
"The board believes strongly that Apogee is poised for future success," said Aldrich. "This is due largely to the hard work and passion that Russ Huffer has infused into this company. We look forward to continuing to work with him during this transition. We are confident that he will leave behind a company with a solid reputation, solid financial base and a best-in-class operating platform."
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Brazilian commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability,

execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and v) integration of the Glassec Viracon business; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) management of discontinued operations exiting activities; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain continuing and discontinued operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

On January 27, 2011, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a credit agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of January 27, 2011, among the Company, each of the lenders from time to time parties to the Agreement, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders, swingline lender and issuer of letters of credit. The Agreement creates a new, three-year, committed, secured, revolving credit facility in the amount of $80 million (subject to increase under the Agreement to an amount not exceeding $120 million). The credit facility includes a letter of credit facility in the amount of up to $50 million, the outstanding amounts of which decrease the available commitment. Upon closing of the Agreement on January 27, 2011, the Agreement replaced the Company's previously existing $100 million unsecured, revolving credit facility, which would have expired in accordance with its terms on November 14, 2011.
The Company may elect the borrowings under the Agreement to bear interest at one of two rates. Borrowings under the Agreement may be made at an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of:
 
 
The Agreement requires the Company to maintain minimum levels of net worth and an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of not more than 2.75. If the Company is not in compliance with either of these requirements, the lenders may terminate the commitment and/or declare any loan then outstanding to be due.
The Agreement provides that the Company may not be a party to any merger, consolidation or share exchange, or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any substantial part of its assets or property, or in any event sell or discount any of its notes or accounts receivable, or permit any subsidiary to do so; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction does not apply to or operate to prevent (1) the Company being a party to any merger where the Company is the surviving person if, after giving effect to such merger, no Default or Event of Default (both as defined in the Agreement) would then exist, (2) any subsidiary merging into the Company, being a party to any merger that does not involve the Company where such subsidiary is the surviving person, or being party to an otherwise permitted merger if, after giving effect to such merger, no Default or Event of Default would then exist, (3) the Company or any subsidiary selling its inventory in the ordinary course of its business, (4) any dissolution of an inactive subsidiary that would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Agreement), if, after giving effect to such dissolution, no Default or Event of Default would then exist, and (5) any Like-Kind Exchange (as defined in the Agreement).
The Agreement places certain limitations on the payment of cash dividends. It provides that the Company may not declare any dividends (other than dividends payable in capital stock of the Company) on any shares of any class of its capital stock, or set apart any sum for the payment of any dividends on, or make any other distribution by reduction of capital or otherwise in respect of, any shares of any class of capital stock of the Company, unless, immediately after giving effect to such action, there shall not have occurred any Default or Event of Default that is continuing. The Agreement limits all such dividends to $12 million per fiscal year until the Company has achieved trailing twelve-month EBITDA in excess of $20 million for two consecutive fiscal quarter-ends after January 27, 2011.
Amounts due under the Agreement may be accelerated upon an Event of Default, such as a breach of a representation or covenant or the occurrence of bankruptcy, if not otherwise waived or cured.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and all of the lenders that are parties to the Agreement were parties to the Prior Agreement described under Item 1.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and certain lenders that are parties to the Agreement have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide, commercial banking, financial and other services to the Company, including letters of credit, depository and account processing services, for which the Company has paid and intends to pay customary fees.
 
The foregoing description of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The Company's previously existing Credit Agreement, dated as of May 4, 2005, among the Company, each of the lenders from time to time parties to the agreement, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as successor to The Bank of New York, as letter of credit issuer, administrative agent for the lenders and swing line lender (as amended, the "Prior Agreement"), created a five-year, committed, unsecured, revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million. The Prior Agreement required the Company to maintain levels of net worth and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of not more than 2.75. If the Company was not in compliance with these requirements, the lenders had the right to terminate the commitment and/or declare any loan then outstanding to be due. The Prior Agreement, which would have expired in accordance with its terms on November 14, 2011, was terminated upon the closing of the Agreement on January 27, 2011. The Company did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Prior Agreement. A brief description of the Company's material relationships with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and the other lenders that were parties to the Prior Agreement is provided under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
As described under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, on January 27, 2011, the Company entered into a three-year, committed, secured, revolving credit facility in the amount of $80 million (subject to increase under the Agreement to an amount not exceeding $120 million). No amounts have been borrowed under this facility.The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.

Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
 
share of such borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at;

The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the applicable Lender's sole discretion, based upon the assumption that such Lender funded its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the London interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical.

Investment Policy
general funds
Investment Policy
 
 
 
 
Primary investment objectives are as follows:
 
 
 
The goal of this policy is to ensure that investments selected meet the objectives for principal protection, adequate liquidity is maintained and after-tax yield is maximized  consistent with the parameters of safety and liquidity.
The following individuals have the authority to establish specific investment direction within the parameters established by this Investment Policy Statement
 
 
Gary R. Johnson or James S. Porter (Messrs. Johnson or Porter) must approve specific Money Market Funds consistent with the Investment Policy Statement.

It should be noted that Messrs. Johnson or Porter may engage Investment Advisor(s) to assist the Company in the identification of investment alternatives. As a general rule, Messrs. Johnson or Porter must approve the purchase of all investments identified by such Investment Advisor(s). However, Messrs. Johnson or Porter may authorize the Investment Advisor(s) to purchase investment securities on behalf of the Company within the parameters of a specific investment direction and within the parameters of the Investment Policy Statement. For example, this authorization may be appropriate for relatively large programs focused on securities with high demand and low supply. Since such trades typically settle several days subsequent to the trade date, Messrs. Johnson or Porter will be required to approve (or not approve) a subsequent wire request for any security purchased on the Company's behalf under such authorization.
 
The funds management process shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations and shall be reviewed and modified as necessary to comply with changes in laws and regulations.

The Amended and Restated 1987 Partnership Plan (the "Legacy Partnership Plan") of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") was eliminated from the Company's compensation program beginning in fiscal 2006. Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company's executive officers and other members of senior management selected by the Board of Directors of the Company were given the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual cash incentive compensation under the Legacy Partnership Plan. The deferred amount was invested in shares of the Company's common stock ("Pool A Shares"), which were held in trust during the period of deferral. The Company matched 100% of a participant's deferred amount in the form of shares of restricted common stock of the Company ("Pool B Shares"). The Pool A Shares were immediately vested and have been distributed to the executive officers who were participants in the Legacy Partnership Plan. The Pool B Shares vested in equal, annual installments over the applicable vesting period. The table below sets forth the number of Pool B Shares held by the listed executive officers as of February 18, 2011:
 
These Pool B Shares relate to compensation awarded in 2001 through 2005, and were scheduled to vest in annual installments through 2015. In order to significantly decrease the administrative burden and cost associated with the Legacy Partnership Plan, effective as of February 18, 2011, the Company and each of the executive officers listed above entered into amendments to the restricted stock award agreements applicable to these Pool B Shares providing that the Pool B Shares would become immediately vested in full. Therefore, the shares will be promptly distributed to such executive officers, and the Company will recognize approximately $334,726 of compensation expense in the current fiscal quarter.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Departure of Gregory A. Silvestri
On February 25, 2011, management of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. ("Apogee") and Gregory A. Silvestri, Executive Vice President of Apogee and President of Viracon, Inc., a subsidiary of Apogee, agreed that Mr. Silvestri's employment with Apogee would terminate, effective as of March 11, 2011.
(e)
Change in Control Severance Agreements
Apogee has had in place change in control severance agreements with certain of its executive officers since 1999, and such agreements have been amended from time to time. In January 2011, Apogee's Compensation Committee and Board of Directors approved a new form of change in control severance agreement for Apogee's executive officers (the "2011 CIC Severance Agreement"). Consistent with the prior severance agreements, the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement is designed to retain the executive officers and provide for continuity of management in the event of an actual or threatened change in control of Apogee (as "change in control" is defined in the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement).
The 2011 CIC Severance Agreement is a "double trigger" agreement. It provides that, in the event of a change in control of Apogee, each executive officer who is a party to an agreement will have specific rights and receive specified benefits if the executive officer's employment is terminated without "cause" (as defined in the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement) or the executive officer voluntarily terminates his or her employment for "good reason" (as defined in the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement) within two years after the change in control (the 10th business day following such employment termination date is referred to herein as the "Employment Termination Date"). In these circumstances, such executive officers will each receive a severance payment equal to either one or two times the executive officer's annual salary plus the executive's targeted annual bonus (as calculated under the terms of the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement). In addition, all options and restricted stock awards held by the executive officer that have not vested by the Employment Termination Date will be immediately vested on such date. Following the Employment Termination Date, the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement provides that, for a 12 or 24-month period following a change in control, Apogee will continue to provide medical and dental insurance coverage for the executive officer and the executive officer's dependents or will reimburse the executive officer for the cost of obtaining substantially similar benefits. No benefits will be paid to the executive officer pursuant to the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement unless the executive officer executes and delivers to Apogee a release of claims.
The previous form of change in control severance agreement provided for tax "gross-up" payments with respect to excise tax liability, if any, under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 related to Section 280G excess parachute payments. The 2011 CIC Severance Agreement, however, contains a "best-net-benefit provision." This provides that, in the event that payments under the agreement trigger excise tax for the executive officer, the executive officer has the option either of reducing the severance payment, if the net benefit is greater than paying the excise tax, or paying the excise tax himself or herself.
During the executive officer's employment with Apogee and for either a 12 or 24-month period following the executive officer's Employment Termination Date, provided that the amounts owed to the executive officer pursuant to the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement have been paid, the executive officer shall not: (1) solicit, directly or indirectly, any existing or prospective customers, vendors or suppliers of Apogee or its affiliates for a purpose competitive to Apogee's business or to encourage such customers, vendors or suppliers to terminate business with Apogee or its affiliates; (2) solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee of Apogee or its affiliates to terminate his or her employment; or (3) engage in or carry on, directly or indirectly, in certain geographic markets a business competitive with Apogee's business (collectively, the "Noncompetition Obligations").
The 2011 CIC Severance Agreement continues through December 31 of each year and provides that it will be automatically extended for one-year terms prior to a change in control unless Apogee gives prior notice of termination.
On March 2, 2011, Apogee executed a 2011 CIC Severance Agreement with each of the named executive officers listed in the table below. Also included in the table is (1) the multiplier used for determining each named executive officer's severance payments and (2) the number of months for which (a) the medical and dental insurance coverage will be provided and (b) the Noncompetition Obligations will be in effect for the executive officers.
 
The foregoing description of the 2011 CIC Severance Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of 2011 CIC Severance Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

For Immediate Release
Wednesday, April 6, 2011
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (April 6, 2011)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2011 full-year and fourth-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.

Commentary
"Our fiscal 2011 results were impacted by extremely challenging commercial construction market conditions for our architectural segment. Architectural segment revenues were down consistent with our markets served, and low architectural glass pricing and low segment capacity utilization led to losses," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chief executive officer. "Earnings from our picture framing business were unable to offset architectural segment losses.
"Our strategy to manage our business over a cycle has positioned us to sustain these losses while maintaining a strong balance sheet and cash on hand. At year-end, our cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $60 million," he said. "During fiscal 2011, we also remained focused on longer-term opportunities and used cash to purchase a leading architectural glass fabricator in Brazil, giving Apogee entre to the large developing market for energy-efficient architectural glass products in Latin America.
"In the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter, we achieved our highest quarterly revenue level for the year, and had positive cash flow from operations," Huffer said. "However, architectural segment losses, resulting from low architectural glass pricing, low segment capacity utilization, expenses related to architectural glass quality issues and costs to implement architectural glass productivity improvements, more than offset another good performance in our large-scale optical segment, where retail picture framing markets are beginning to improve.
"Architectural segment revenue declines slowed and backlog grew in the fourth quarter, signaling that our markets may be stabilizing. We believe that we are well positioned for a market rebound with our strong balance sheet, green energy-efficient products, expertise in complex institutional projects, and success in pursuing installation work in new domestic geographies," he said.

OUTLOOK
"For fiscal 2012, we are expecting a slight increase in revenues, and believe we have the potential to be profitable for the year, with first-half losses offset by second-half earnings," Huffer said. "This outlook factors in our expectations that increased architectural glass pricing will flow through in the second half and that we will be able to fill open fourth-quarter architectural segment capacity. We are anticipating lower margins in the installation business with execution of projects bid at the cycle trough. Overall, we are expecting that actions we've taken in our architectural businesses, ranging from price increases and productivity improvements to project selection changes, will result in improving results as fiscal 2012 progresses.
"The McGraw-Hill Construction forecast for non-residential construction and the American Institute of Architects Architecture Billings Index indicate that our end markets should start improving later in calendar 2011," Huffer said. "However, Apogee is a very late cycle company that lags commercial construction markets by several months."
He added that architectural bidding activity continues to be good and remains driven by institutional work  government, education and health care projects  but that the majority of work currently being bid is scheduled for fiscal 2013.
"We anticipate that our large-scale optical segment will continue to be profitable throughout fiscal 2012," he said. "We also expect Apogee to generate positive cash flow from operations.

"We believe we are well positioned financially and anticipate renewed interest in value-added, energy-efficient products as domestic commercial construction markets recover. We are focused on introducing new green products, both in the United States and internationally, including in Latin American markets through our Brazilian acquisition," he said.
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Latin American commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and v) integration of the Brazilian architectural glass business; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix and new competition; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) ability to effectively manage executive transitions; iii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iv) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain continuing operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 27, 2010.

Counterparts
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Amendment to be duly executed and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed and attested, all as of the dates set forth below.
 
Attest:
 
 
Attest:
 
 
Exhibit C
On October 19, 1990, the Board of Directors of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company"), declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a "Right") per share for each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $.33 1/3 (the "Common Shares"), of the Company. The dividend was payable on November 6, 1990 (the "Record Date") to shareholders of record on that date.
Each Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 (the "Preferred Shares"), of the Company at a price of $65.00 per one-hundredth of a Preferred Share (the "Purchase Price"), subject to adjustment. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in the Rights Agreement, as restated and amended through April 25, 2011 (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent").
Initially, the Rights will attach to all certificates representing Common Shares then outstanding and no separate Right Certificates will be distributed. The Rights will separate from the Common Shares, and a Distribution Date for the Rights will occur upon the earlier of:
(i) the close of business on the day following a public announcement that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons has become an "Acquiring Person" (i.e., has become, subject to certain exceptions, the beneficial owner of 15% (the "Threshold Percentage") or more of the outstanding Common Shares); and
(ii) the close of business on the day following the commencement or public announcement of the intention to commence a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in a person or group of affiliated or associated persons becoming, subject to certain exceptions, the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the outstanding Common Shares (or such later date as may be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company prior to a person or group of affiliated or associated persons becoming an Acquiring Person).
A Person will not be an Acquiring Person if the Board of Directors of the Company determines that such Person became the Beneficial Owner of the Threshold Percentage or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding inadvertently and such Person divests itself, within a reasonable period of time as determined by the Board of Directors, of a sufficient number of Common Shares so that such Person is no longer the Beneficial Owner of the Threshold Percentage or more of the Common Shares of the Company then outstanding.
Until the Distribution Date,
 
(i) the Rights will be evidenced by the Common Share certificates and will be transferred with and only with the Common Shares,
(ii) new Common Share certificates issued after the Record Date upon transfer or new issuance of the Common Shares will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by reference, and
(iii) the surrender for transfer of any Common Share certificate, even without such notation or a copy of this Summary of Rights attached thereto, also will constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Shares represented by such certificate.
As promptly as practicable following the Distribution Date, separate certificates evidencing the Rights ("Right Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of the Common Shares as of the close of business on the Distribution Date, and such separate Right Certificates alone will evidence the Rights.
The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribution Date. The Rights will expire on October 11, 2011, unless extended or earlier redeemed or exchanged by the Company as described below.
The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Preferred Shares or other securities or property issuable upon exercise of the Rights, are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution:
(i) in the event of a stock dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassification of, the Preferred Shares,
(ii) upon the grant to holders of the Preferred Shares of certain rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Preferred Shares or convertible securities at less than the then current market price of the Preferred Shares, or
(iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Shares of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular periodic cash dividends or dividends payable in Preferred Shares) or of subscription rights or warrants (other than those described in clause (ii) of this paragraph).
With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments require an adjustment of at least 1% in the Purchase Price. No fraction of a Preferred Share will be issued (other than fractional shares which are integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a Preferred Share, which may, at the election of the Company, be evidenced by depositary receipts) if in lieu thereof, a payment in cash is made based on the closing price (prorated for the fraction) of a Preferred Share on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise.
The number of outstanding Rights and the number of one one-hundredths of a Preferred Share issuable upon exercise of each Right also are subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split of the Common Shares, a stock dividend on the Common Shares payable in Common Shares, or subdivisions, consolidations or combinations of the Common Shares occurring, in any such case, prior to the Distribution Date.
 
Preferred Shares purchasable upon exercise of the Rights will not be redeemable. Each Preferred Share will be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend payment of $1.00 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate dividend of 100 times the dividend declared per Common Share. In the event of liquidation, the holders of the Preferred Shares will be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $100 per share but will be entitled to an aggregate payment of 100 times the payment made per Common Share. Each Preferred Share will have 100 votes, voting together with the Common Shares. Finally, in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Shares are exchanged, each Preferred Share will be entitled to receive 100 times the amount received per Common Share. These rights are protected by customary antidilution provisions.
Because of the nature of the Preferred Shares' dividend, liquidation and voting rights, the value of the one one-hundredth interest in a Preferred Share purchasable upon exercise of each Right should approximate the value of one Common Share.
If any person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person (unless the event by which such Person became an Acquiring Person is a transaction described in the following paragraph), then each holder of a Right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person and certain transferees thereof (which will thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of Common Shares having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right, subject to certain possible adjustments.
If, at any time after there is an Acquiring Person, the Company is acquired in certain mergers or other business combination transactions (other than certain transactions with a subsidiary of the Company or a transaction with a person who acquired Common Shares through a tender offer or exchange offer for all outstanding Common Shares of the Company determined by the Board of Directors to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders) or 50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its subsidiaries (taken as a whole) are sold, each holder of a Right (other than Rights which have become void under the terms of the Rights Agreement) will thereafter have the right to receive, upon exercise thereof at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of common shares of the acquiring company (or, in certain cases, one of its affiliates) having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right.
In certain events specified in the Rights Agreement, the Company is permitted temporarily to suspend the exercisability of the Rights.
At any time after a person or group of affiliated or associated persons becomes an Acquiring Person, and prior to the acquisition by a person or group of affiliated or associated persons of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may exchange all or part of the Rights (other than Rights which have become void under the terms of the Rights Agreement) for Common Shares at an exchange ratio of one Common Share per Right, subject to adjustment.
 
At any time prior to such time as any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, the Board of Directors of the Company may redeem the Rights in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per Right, subject to adjustment (the "Redemption Price"), payable in cash, Common Shares or any other form of consideration deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. The period of time during which the Rights may be redeemed may be extended if no person has become an Acquiring Person. The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of Directors in its sole discretion may establish.
Until a Right is exercised, the holder thereof, as such, will have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, including without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends. In addition, the Company will have no liability to holders of Rights or of the Common Shares for any failure to comply with the Rights Agreement during any period the Board of Directors is unaware of the existence of the Acquiring Person.
A copy of the Rights Agreement, as amended and restated through November 12, 2001, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as an exhibit to Amendment No. 5 to the Company's Registration Statement on Form 8-A dated November 30, 2001 (the "Form 8-A"), and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the Rights Agreement have been filed with the SEC as exhibits to Amendment Nos. 6 and 7, respectively, to the Company's Registration Statement on Form 8-A dated June 25, 2010 and April [], 2011, respectively. A copy of the Rights Agreement, as restated and amended through April 25, 2011, is available free of charge from the Company by contacting the Secretary of Apogee Enterprises, Inc., 4400 West 78
    
th

On April 26, 2011, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Bonus Pool Award Agreement with each of the named executive officers listed below, which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the executive officer may receive an annual bonus award under the Amended and Restated Apogee Enterprises, Inc. Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "Executive MIP"). The agreements provide that the executive officers' rights to receive annual cash bonus awards will be determined based on the attainment of certain pre-set performance metrics or goals for the fiscal year.
The performance metrics to be used for determining awards under the Executive MIP for fiscal 2012 for the named executive officers listed below other than Mr. Huffer are net sales and earnings per share from continuing operations at the corporate level. For each of the performance metrics there is a threshold, target and maximum performance level. Mr. Huffer's award under the Executive MIP for fiscal 2012 will be based on the achievement of certain goals relating to performance of the Viracon business unit and the Company's cash flow and goals related to the execution of the Company's enterprise resource planning implementation and other strategic initiatives. The table below sets forth certain information with respect to fiscal 2012 annual bonus award payout ranges as a percentage of fiscal 2012 salary for the named executive officers.
 
 
In the event an executive officer's employment is terminated during a fiscal year for any reason other than Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined in the agreement) or death, the agreement provides that the executive officer will forfeit any and all rights under the Executive MIP and the agreement relating to such fiscal year. In accordance with the agreement, if an executive officer's employment with the Company is terminated during the fiscal year as a result of Disability, Retirement or death, the executive officer, or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, will receive a pro-rata cash payment after the end of the fiscal year to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics/goals is achieved.
The form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement used in connection with annual bonus awards under the Executive MIP, a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1, is incorporated herein by reference to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 4, 2009 (the "Form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement").
 
Performance Share Unit and Restricted Stock Awards
Performance Share Units
On April 26, 2011, the Company's Compensation Committee awarded to the named executive officers listed below performance share unit awards entitling the executive officers to the number of performance share units (the "Units") equal to the target number of shares set forth below (the "Target Award Number").
 
Each Unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, subject to the vesting requirements described below. The Units were awarded pursuant to the shareholder-approved Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2009 Stock Incentive Plan"), a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 4.5 to the Company's Form S-8 filed on June 24, 2009. The form of Performance Share Unit Agreement used in connection with the awards to the executive officers listed above and to be used on a going-forward basis for performance share unit awards under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference (the "Form of 2009 Stock Incentive Plan Performance Share Unit Agreement").
The number of Units that will vest will be based on whether and to what extent the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics for the period commencing on February 27, 2011 and ending on March 1, 2014 (the "Performance Period") is achieved. The performance metrics for the Performance Period are average return on invested capital, cumulative earnings per share and market share growth. The Target Award Number will be increased to the Maximum Award Number set forth above if the Company's performance metrics are achieved at the maximum level or decreased to zero if none of the Company's performance metrics are achieved at the threshold performance level. The Threshold Award Number set forth above represents the number of Units that would vest if the Company achieved each performance metric at the threshold level.
In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated during the Performance Period, the Units shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited, unless the executive officer's termination is by reason of involuntary termination without Cause (as defined in the agreement), Retirement (as defined in the agreement), Disability (as defined in the agreement), or death. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of involuntary termination without Cause, the Compensation Committee has the right to permit the executive officer to retain a pro-rata portion (based on the amount of time elapsed between the beginning of the Performance Period and the date of termination) of the Units after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved and as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of Retirement, Disability or death, the executive officer or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, shall be entitled to retain the Units after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved and as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion.
In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan) prior to the end of the Performance Period, the Performance Period shall be deemed to end on the date of the Change in Control and the executive officer shall be entitled to retain the Units to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved, as adjusted for the truncated Performance Period, and as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion if (1) the executive officer remains employed through the end of the Performance Period or (2) the executive officer's employment terminates prior to the end of the Performance Period due to Retirement, Disability, death, involuntary termination without Cause or Good Reason (as defined in the agreement).

The shares of restricted stock vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary date of such grant (such three-year period is referred to herein as the "Restricted Period"). In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Restricted Period by reason of Retirement (as defined in the agreement) or involuntary termination without Cause (as defined in the agreement), the Compensation Committee has the right to cause the remaining unvested shares to be accelerated as of the date of such Retirement or involuntary termination without Cause. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Restricted Period by reason of Disability or death, the shares of restricted stock will become immediately vested in full.

While Mr. Huffer will remain as an employee of the Company through February 25, 2012, his bonus opportunity under the plan will be pro-rated based on the time for which he serves as the Company's Chief Executive Officer during fiscal 2012.

8. . As a material inducement for Apogee to enter into this Agreement, Huffer agrees not to compete with Apogee during the period prior to the Retirement Date and for the additional periods set forth in the agreements referred to below, in accordance with the terms set forth in such agreements and enforceable in accordance with the terms set forth below.
Non-Competition
(a) Huffer agrees to comply with the terms of the noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants contained in each of the equity award agreements and each of the retirement plans to which he is either a party or a participant or beneficiary as of the Retirement Date.
(b) The parties intend that each of the covenants referenced in subsection (a) of this Section 8 shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each state of the United States and each county of each state of the United States. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in such clauses, then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the provisions of this Section 8 should ever be deemed to exceed the time or geographic limitations, or the scope of this covenant, permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable laws. The unenforceability of any covenant in this Section 8 shall not preclude the enforcement of any other of said covenants or provisions or of any other obligation of Huffer or Apogee hereunder, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Huffer or Apogee against the other, whether predicated on the Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Apogee of any of said covenants.
(c) It is understood and agreed that damages may be an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by Huffer of any of his obligations in this Section 8, and that any such breach may cause Apogee irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, Huffer agrees that Apogee shall be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies otherwise available to Apogee, to injunctive and other such equitable relief in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach of any of said covenants by Huffer.

The provisions of this Section 10(a) shall not apply to any truthful statement(s) required to be made by Huffer or by any representative of Huffer in any legal proceeding or governmental (including all agencies thereof) or regulatory filing, investigation or proceeding.
(b) Apogee agrees that none of its Senior Executives (as defined below) will criticize, defame or disparage Huffer, his performance with Apogee, his plans, or his actions to any third party, either orally or in writing.

Senior Executives
11. . Should Apogee default in timely payment on the due date of any payment or amount due under this Agreement, Huffer shall give written notice of such default to the person specified in or pursuant to this Agreement to receive notice on behalf of Apogee. Apogee shall have ten calendar days after the receipt of such a notice of default to cure any payment default. Huffer's failure to provide such notice shall not negate Apogee's obligation to make payment of any amounts due to Huffer under this Agreement, but Apogee's ten calendar day cure period shall not commence until it receives such notice from Huffer.
Apogee's Default in Payment
12. . If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that either party has breached or failed to perform any part of this Agreement, the parties agree that the non-breaching party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement and that the breaching party shall be responsible for paying the non-breaching party's costs and attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing this Agreement.

On April 27, 2011, the Company and Mr. Huffer entered into a Transition Agreement documenting the compensation to which Mr. Huffer will be entitled in connection with his retirement from the Company pursuant to the terms agreed to in January 2011. On May 3, 2011, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Amendment No. 1 to the Original Filing ("Amendment No. 1"), which described the material terms of the Transition Agreement and amended and superseded the disclosure provided under "Fiscal 2012 Compensation" and "Separation Payments" in the Original Filing. The Company is filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this Amendment No. 2 to the Original Filing in order to correct certain typographical errors included in Amendment No. 1.

Authorization for disclosure of Confidential Information, which may be withheld at Apogee's sole discretion, may be obtained only from Apogee's General Counsel or designee.

(a) Huffer agrees to comply with the terms of the noncompetition and nonsolicitation covenants contained in each of the equity award agreements and each of the retirement plans to which he is either a party or a participant or beneficiary as of the Retirement Date.
(b) The parties intend that each of the covenants referenced in subsection (a) of this Section 8 shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each state of the United States and each county of each state of the United States. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any of the separate covenants (or any part thereof) deemed included in such clauses, then such unenforceable covenant (or such part) shall be deemed eliminated from this Agreement for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants (or portions thereof) to be enforced. In the event that the provisions of this Section 8 should ever be deemed to exceed the time or geographic limitations, or the scope of this covenant, permitted by applicable law, then such provisions shall be reformed to the maximum time or geographic limitations, as the case may be, permitted by applicable laws. The unenforceability of any covenant in this Section 8 shall not preclude the enforcement of any other of said covenants or provisions or of any other obligation of Huffer or Apogee hereunder, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of Huffer or Apogee against the other, whether predicated on the Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Apogee of any of said covenants.
(c) It is understood and agreed that damages may be an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by Huffer of any of his obligations in this Section 8, and that any such breach may cause Apogee irreparable injury and damage. Accordingly, Huffer agrees that Apogee shall be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies otherwise available to Apogee, to injunctive and other such equitable relief in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach of any of said covenants by Huffer.

Apogee shall have ten calendar days after the receipt of such a notice of default to cure any payment default. Huffer's failure to provide such notice shall not negate Apogee's obligation to make payment of any amounts due to Huffer under this Agreement, but Apogee's ten calendar day cure period shall not commence until it receives such notice from Huffer.
Apogee's Default in Payment
12. . If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that either party has breached or failed to perform any part of this Agreement, the parties agree that the non-breaching party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement and that the breaching party shall be responsible for paying the non-breaching party's costs and attorneys' fees incurred in enforcing this Agreement.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Tuesday, June 21, 2011
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (June 21, 2011)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2012 first-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY12 FIRST QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"Although losses continued for Apogee with the ongoing difficult commercial construction market conditions, we are encouraged that revenues increased year on year and our architectural segment backlog again grew sequentially," said Russell Huffer, Apogee chief executive officer. "Our large-scale optical segment grew revenues and earnings with a good mix of value-added picture framing glass and acrylic in an improving retail market.
"As expected, our first-quarter architectural segment losses resulted from low pricing on architectural glass projects and lower margins on installation projects bid at the bottom of the commercial construction cycle, as well as low architectural glass capacity utilization," he said. "Our balance sheet remains solid with cash and short-term investments at $43 million."
He added that all businesses operated well in the quarter.

OUTLOOK
"Our outlook for fiscal 2012 has improved slightly as we've become more confident that architectural glass price increases should flow through as the year progresses and stronger volume is anticipated for our architectural glass and storefront businesses," Huffer said. "For fiscal 2012, we now expect revenue growth to exceed 10 percent, and we expect to be slightly profitable for the year. This outlook, in part, depends on our ability to fill in open fourth-quarter capacity in our architectural segment. We also expect Apogee to generate positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012.

"We believe that actions we've taken in our architectural businesses, ranging from price increases and productivity improvements to project selection changes, will contribute to improved fiscal 2012 results. Somewhat offsetting improvements will be lower margins in the installation business as it executes projects bid at the cycle trough," Huffer said. "We anticipate that our large-scale optical segment will continue to be profitable throughout fiscal 2012.
"The McGraw-Hill Construction forecast for non-residential construction and the American Institute of Architects Architecture Billings Index indicate that our end markets should start improving later in calendar 2011," Huffer said. "However, Apogee is a very late cycle company that lags commercial construction markets by several months."
He added that architectural bidding activity continues to be good and remains driven by institutional work  government, education and health care projects  but that the majority of work currently being bid is scheduled for fiscal 2013.
"We believe we are well positioned financially and anticipate renewed interest in value-added, energy-efficient products as domestic commercial construction markets recover. We are focused on introducing new green products, both in the United States and internationally, including in Latin American markets through our Brazilian acquisition," he said.
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Latin American commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and v) integration of the Brazilian architectural glass business; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix and new competition; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) ability to effectively manage executive transitions; iii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iv) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain continuing operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2011.

(the "Company"), the Company's shareholders approved certain amendments (the "2009 Incentive Plan Amendments") to the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "2009 Incentive Plan").
The 2009 Incentive Plan was initially approved by the Company's shareholders on June 24, 2009. The purpose of the 2009 Incentive Plan is to promote the interests of the Company and its shareholders by (1) aiding the Company in attracting and retaining management personnel capable of providing strategic direction to, and assuring the future success of, the Company and (2) motivating such persons to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the Company's business. The 2009 Incentive Plan allows the Company to compensate such persons through various stock-based arrangements and provide them with opportunities for stock ownership in the Company, thereby aligning the interests of such persons with the Company's shareholders. The 2009 Incentive Plan permits grants of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards, stock awards and other stock-based awards (collectively, "Awards") to employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors of the Company. The Company's Board of Directors and Compensation Committee have the authority to determine the type of Award as well as the amount, terms and conditions of each Award under the 2009 Incentive Plan, subject to the limitations and other provisions of the 2009 Incentive Plan. Awards may be granted under the 2009 Incentive Plan until June 23, 2019 or until all shares available for Awards under the 2009 Incentive Plan have been purchased or acquired; provided, however, that incentive stock options may not be granted after May 7, 2019.

Power and Authority of the Committee
(b) . The Committee may delegate its powers and duties under the Plan to one or more Directors (including a Director who is also an officer of the Company) or a committee of Directors and may authorize one or more officers of the Company to grant Awards under the Plan, subject to such terms, conditions and limitations as the Committee may establish in its sole discretion; , that the Committee shall not delegate its powers and duties under the Plan (i) with regard to officers of the Company or any Affiliate who are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (ii) in such a manner as would cause the Plan not to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m).
Delegation
provided, however
(c) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board may, at any time and from time to time, without any further action of the Committee, exercise the powers and duties of the Committee under the Plan, unless the exercise of such powers and duties by the Board would cause the Plan not to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m).
Power and Authority of the Board
 
(a) . Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the aggregate number of Shares that may be issued under all Awards under the Plan shall be 1,888,000. If an Award terminates or is forfeited or cancelled without the issuance of any Shares, or if any Shares covered by an Award or
Shares Available
 
to which an Award relates are not issued for any other reason, then the number of Shares counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award, to the extent of any such termination, forfeiture, cancellation or other event, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan. If Shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited or otherwise reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, whether or not dividends have been paid on such Shares, then the number of Shares counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award of Restricted Stock, to the extent of any such forfeiture or reacquisition by the Company, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan. Shares that are withheld in full or partial payment to the Company of the purchase or exercise price relating to an Award or in connection with the satisfaction of tax obligations relating to an Award shall not be available for granting Awards under the Plan.
(b) . For purposes of this Section 4, if an Award entitles the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award or to which such Award relates shall be counted on the date of grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. For Stock Appreciation Rights settled in Shares upon exercise, the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is granted, rather than the number of Shares actually issued upon exercise, shall be counted against the number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. Awards that do not entitle the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares and Awards that are settled in cash shall not be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan.
Accounting for Awards
(c) . In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is necessary in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it deems equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) which thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards, (iii) the purchase or exercise price with respect to any Award and (iv) the limitations contained in Section 4(d) of the Plan; , that the number of Shares covered by any Award or to which such Award relates shall always be a whole number. Such adjustment shall be made by the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Adjustments
provided, however
(d) .
Award Limitations Under the Plan
(i) . No Eligible Person may be granted Options, Stock Appreciation Rights or any other Award or Awards under the Plan, the value of which Award or Awards is based solely on an increase in the value of the Shares after the date of grant of such Award or Awards, for more than 500,000 Shares (subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan) in the aggregate in any calendar year.
Section 162(m) Limitation for Certain Types of Awards
(ii) . The maximum amount payable pursuant to all Performance Awards to any Participant in the aggregate in any fiscal year shall be $5,000,000 in value, whether payable in cash, Shares or other property (calculated based on the Fair Market Value of the Shares or other property on the date of grant). This limitation does not apply to any Award subject to the limitation contained in Section 4(d)(i) of the Plan.
Section 162(m) Limitation for Performance Awards
 
Any Eligible Person, including any Eligible Person who is an officer of the Company or any Affiliate, shall be eligible to be designated a Participant. In determining which Eligible Persons shall receive an Award and the terms of any Award, the Committee may take into account the nature of the services rendered by the respective Eligible Persons, their present and potential contributions to the success of the Company, previous Awards received by such Eligible Person (whether under the Plan or a predecessor plan of the Company), or such other factors as the Committee, in its discretion, shall deem relevant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Incentive Stock Option may only be granted to full-time or part-time employees (which term as used herein includes, without
 
limitation, officers), and an Incentive Stock Option shall not be granted to an employee of an Affiliate unless such Affiliate is also a "subsidiary corporation" of the Company within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code or any successor provision.
 
(a) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Options to Eligible Persons with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
Options
(i) . The purchase price per Share purchasable under an Option shall be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that such purchase price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such Option.
Exercise Price
(ii) . The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee but shall not be longer than 10 years from the date of grant.
Option Term
(iii) . The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part and the method or methods by which, and the form or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the applicable exercise price) in which, payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made.
Time and Method of Exercise
(b) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Eligible Persons subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement. A Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder thereof a right to receive upon exercise thereof the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise (or, if the Committee shall so determine, at any time during a specified period before or after the date of exercise) over (ii) the grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right as specified by the Committee, which price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the grant price, term, methods of exercise, dates of exercise, methods of settlement and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right shall be as determined by the Committee; , that the term of each Stock Appreciation Right shall not be longer than 10 years from the date of grant. The Committee may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem appropriate.
Stock Appreciation Rights
provided, however
(c) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units to Eligible Persons with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
(i) . Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without limitation, any limitation on the right to vote a Share of Restricted Stock or the right to receive any dividend or other right or property with respect thereto), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or times, in such installments or otherwise as the Committee may deem appropriate.
Restrictions
(ii) . Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted and may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates, which certificate or certificates shall be held by the Company. Such certificate or certificates shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. Shares representing Restricted Stock that is no longer subject to restrictions shall be delivered to the Participant promptly after the applicable restrictions lapse or are waived. In the case of Restricted Stock Units, no Shares shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted. Upon the lapse or waiver of restrictions and the restricted period
Issuance and Delivery of Shares
 
relating to Restricted Stock Units evidencing the right to receive Shares, such Shares shall be issued and delivered to the holder of the Restricted Stock Units.
(iii) . Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a Participant's termination of employment (as determined under criteria established by the Committee) during the applicable restriction period, all Shares of Restricted Stock and all Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant at such time shall be forfeited and reacquired by the Company; provided, however, that the Committee may, when it finds that a waiver would be in the best interest of the Company, waive in whole or in part any or all remaining restrictions with respect to Shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.
Forfeiture
(d) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant "Dividend Equivalents" to Eligible Persons under which the Participant shall be entitled to receive payments (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property as determined in the discretion of the Committee) equivalent to the amount of cash dividends paid by the Company to holders of Shares with respect to a number of Shares determined by the Committee. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, such Dividend Equivalents may have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not grant Dividend Equivalents to Eligible Persons in connection with grants of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights to such Eligible Persons.
Dividend Equivalents
(e) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Performance Awards to Eligible Persons subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement. A Performance Award granted under the Plan (i) may be denominated or payable in cash, Shares (including, without limitation, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units), other securities, other Awards or other property and (ii) shall confer on the holder thereof the right to receive payments, in whole or in part, upon the achievement of such performance goals during such performance periods as the Committee shall establish. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the performance goals to be achieved during any performance period, the length of any performance period, the amount of any Performance Award granted, the amount of any payment or transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Award and any other terms and conditions of any Performance Award shall be determined by the Committee.
Performance Awards
The Committee intends to have Performance Awards constitute awards of "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m). Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the following additional requirements shall apply to all Performance Awards made to any Participant:
(i) Any Performance Award shall be null and void and have no effect whatsoever unless the Plan shall have been approved by the shareholders of the Company at the Company's 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
(ii) The right to receive a Performance Award shall be determined solely on account of the attainment of one or more pre-established, objective performance goals selected by the Committee in connection with the grant of the Performance Award. Such performance goals may apply to the Participant individually, an identifiable business unit of the Company or the Company as a whole measured on an absolute or relative (as compared to an index or set of peer companies) basis. The performance goals shall be based solely on one or more of the following business criteria: economic value added, sales or revenues, costs or expenses, net profit after tax, gross profit, operating profit, base earnings, earnings (whether before or after taxes), earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), earnings (whether before or after taxes), EBIT or EBITDA as a percent of net sales, return on actual or pro forma equity or net assets or capital, net capital employed, earnings per share (basic or diluted), earnings per share from continuing operations, operating income, pre-tax income, operating income margin, net income, total shareholder return or profitability, or both, as measured by one or more of the following accounting ratios: return on revenue, return on assets, return on equity, return on invested capital and return on investments, shareholder return, cash generation, cash flow (including free cash flow and cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities or any combination thereof), unit volume, change in working capital, market share, days payables outstanding (DPO) and days sales outstanding of receivables (DSO). The foregoing shall constitute the sole business criteria upon which the performance goals under this Plan shall be based.
 
(iii) The target and range of a Participant's possible awards established by the Committee shall be between zero and 300% of the Participant's annual base compensation for the Chief Executive Officer. The target and range of a Participant's possible awards established by the Committee shall be between zero and 200% of the Participant's annual base compensation for each of the Executive Vice Presidents, the Chief Financial Officer, the General Counsel and Division Presidents. For other Participants who are not "Covered Employees" as defined in Section 162(m), the Committee shall establish such targets and ranges.
(iv) For a Performance Award, the Committee shall, not later than 90 days after the beginning of each fiscal year of the Company:
(A) designate all Participants for such fiscal year;
(B) establish the objective performance factors for each Participant for that fiscal year on the basis of one or more of the business criteria set forth herein; and

(v) Following the close of each performance period and prior to payment of any amount to any Participant under the Plan, the Committee must certify in writing as to the attainment of all factors (including the performance factors for a Participant) upon which any payments to a Participant for that fiscal year are to be based.
(vi) Each of the foregoing provisions, and all of the other terms and conditions of the Plan as it applies to any Performance Award, shall be interpreted in such a fashion so as to qualify all compensation paid thereunder as "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m).
(f) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Persons Shares without restrictions thereon, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, such Stock Awards may have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
Stock Awards
(g) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Eligible Persons such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares), as are deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards, subject to the terms of the Plan and the Award Agreement. Shares, or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted under this Section 6(g), shall be purchased for consideration having a value equal to at least 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Shares or other securities on the date the purchase right is granted. The consideration paid by the Participant may be paid by such method or methods and in such form or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof), as the Committee shall determine.
Other Stock-Based Awards

(ii) . Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with or in substitution for any other Award or any award granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate. Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards or in addition to or in tandem with awards granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards.
Awards May Be Granted Separately or Together
 
(iii) . Subject to the terms of the Plan and of any applicable Award Agreement, payments or transfers to be made by the Company or an Affiliate upon the grant, exercise or payment of an Award may be made in such form or forms as the Committee shall determine (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof), and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments or on a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures may include, without limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting of Dividend Equivalents with respect to installment or deferred payments.
Forms of Payment under Awards
(iv) . The term of each Award shall be for a period not longer than 10 years from the date of grant.
Term of Awards
(v) . Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6(h)(v), no Award (other than a Stock Award) and no right under any such Award shall be transferable by a Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The Committee may establish procedures as it deems appropriate for a Participant to designate a Person or Persons, as beneficiary or beneficiaries, to exercise the rights of the Participant and receive any property distributable with respect to any Award in the event of the Participant's death. The Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it determines, may permit a Participant to transfer a Non-Qualified Stock Option to any "family member" (as such term is defined in the General Instructions to Form S-8 (or any successor to such Instructions or such Form) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) at any time that such Participant holds such Option, provided that such transfers may not be for value (i.e., the transferor may not receive any consideration therefor) and the family member may not make any subsequent transfers other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Each Award under the Plan or right under any such Award shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant (except as provided herein or in an Award Agreement or amendment thereto relating to a Non-Qualified Stock Option) or, if permissible under applicable law, by the Participant's guardian or legal representative. No Award (other than a Stock Award) or right under any such Award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate.
Limits on Transfer of Awards
(vi) . All Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan, applicable federal or state securities laws and regulatory requirements, and the Committee may cause appropriate entries to be made or legends to be placed on the certificates for such Shares or other securities to reflect such restrictions. If the Shares or other securities are traded on a securities exchange, the Company shall not be required to deliver any Shares or other securities covered by an Award unless and until such Shares or other securities have been admitted for trading on such securities exchange.
Restrictions; Securities Exchange Listing
(vii) . Except as provided in Section 4(c) hereof, no Option may be amended to reduce its initial exercise price, no Option may be cancelled and replaced with an Option or Options having a lower exercise price and no Option that is underwater may be cancelled and exchanged for cash or another Award. In addition, except as provided in Section 4(c) hereof, no Stock Appreciation Right may be amended to reduce its grant price, no Stock Appreciation Right may be cancelled and replaced with a Stock Appreciation Right having a lower grant price and no Stock Appreciation Right that is underwater may be cancelled and exchanged for cash or another Award.
Prohibition on Option and Stock Appreciation Right Repricing
(viii) . Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or any Award Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that any amount or benefit that constitutes "deferred compensation" to a Participant under Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance thereunder is otherwise payable or distributable to a Participant under the Plan or any Award Agreement solely by reason of the occurrence of a Change in Control or due to the Participant's disability or "separation from service" (as such term is defined under Section 409A), such amount or benefit will not be payable or distributable to the Participant by reason of such circumstance unless the Committee determines in good faith that (i) the circumstances giving rise to such Change in Control, disability or separation from service meet the definition of a change in ownership or control, disability, or separation from service, as the case may be, in Section 409A(a)(2)(A) of the Code and applicable proposed or final regulations, or (ii) the payment or distribution of such amount or benefit would be exempt from the application of Section 409A by

Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Committee may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate any outstanding Award, prospectively or retroactively, but no such action may adversely affect the rights of the holder of such Award without the consent of the Participant or holder or beneficiary thereof. The Company intends that Awards under the Plan shall satisfy the requirements of Section 409A to avoid any adverse tax results thereunder, and the Committee shall administer and interpret the Plan and all Award Agreements in a manner consistent with that intent. If any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement would result in adverse tax consequences under Section 409A, the Committee may amend that provision (or take any other action reasonably necessary) to avoid any adverse tax results and no action taken to comply with Section 409A shall be deemed to impair or otherwise adversely affect the rights of any holder of an Award or beneficiary thereof.
Amendments to Awards
(c) . The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to implement or maintain the effectiveness of the Plan.
Correction of Defects, Omissions and Inconsistencies
 
In order to comply with all applicable federal or state income tax laws or regulations, the Company may take such action as it deems appropriate to ensure that all applicable federal or state payroll, withholding, income or other taxes, which are the sole and absolute responsibility of a Participant are withheld or collected from such Participant. In order to assist a Participant in paying all or a portion of the applicable taxes to be withheld or collected upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) an Award, the Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it may adopt, may permit the Participant to
 
satisfy such tax obligation by (a) electing to have the Company withhold a portion of the Shares otherwise to be delivered upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes or (b) delivering to the Company Shares other than Shares issuable upon exercise or receipt of (or the lapse of restrictions relating to) such Award with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such taxes. The election, if any, must be made on or before the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is determined.
 
(a) . No Eligible Person, Participant or other Person shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Eligible Persons, Participants or holders or beneficiaries of Awards under the Plan. The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with respect to any Participant or with respect to different Participants.
No Rights to Awards
(b) . No Participant shall have rights under an Award granted to such Participant unless and until an Award Agreement shall have been duly executed on behalf of the Company and, if requested by the Company, signed by the Participant, or until such Award Agreement is delivered and accepted through any electronic medium in accordance with procedures established by the Company.
Award Agreements
(c) . Except with respect to Restricted Stock and Stock Awards, neither a Participant nor the Participant's legal representative shall be, or have any of the rights and privileges of, a shareholder of the Company with respect to any Shares issuable upon the exercise or payment of any Award, in whole or in part, unless and until the Shares have been issued.
No Rights of Shareholders
(d) . Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company or any Affiliate from adopting or continuing in effect other or additional compensation plans or arrangements, and such plans or arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
No Limit on Other Compensation Plans or Arrangements
(e) . The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company or any Affiliate, nor will it affect in any way the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate a Participant's employment at any time, with or without cause. In addition, the Company or an Affiliate may at any time dismiss a Participant from employment free from any liability or any claim under the Plan or any Award, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in any Award Agreement.
No Right to Employment
(f) . The validity, construction and effect of the Plan or any Award, and any rules and regulations relating to the Plan or any Award, shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the State of Minnesota.
Governing Law
(g) . If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction or Award, and the remainder of the Plan or any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability
(h) . Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other Person. To the extent that any Person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or any Affiliate.
No Trust or Fund Created
 
(i) . No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash shall be paid in lieu of any fractional Share or whether such fractional Share or any rights thereto shall be cancelled, terminated or otherwise eliminated.
No Fractional Shares
(j) . Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.
Headings
(k) . No compensation or benefit awarded to or realized by any Participant under the Plan shall be included for the purpose of computing such Participant's compensation under any compensation-based retirement, disability, or similar plan of the Company unless required by law or otherwise provided by such other plan.
Other Benefits
 
The Plan shall be subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on June 24, 2009, and the Plan shall be effective as of the date of such shareholder approval. On and after the date of shareholder approval of the Plan, no awards shall be granted to Eligible Persons (as defined herein) under the 2002 Plan, but all outstanding awards previously granted under the 2002 Plan shall remain outstanding in accordance with the terms thereof.
 
The Plan shall terminate at midnight on June 23, 2019, unless terminated before then by the Board. Awards may be granted under the Plan until the earlier to occur of termination of the Plan or the date on which all Shares available for Awards under the Plan have been purchased or acquired; , that Incentive Stock Options may not be granted following the 10-year anniversary of the Board's adoption of the Plan.

Power and Authority of the Committee
 
decisions under or with respect to the Plan or any Award or Award Agreement shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee, may be made at any time and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon any Participant, any holder or beneficiary of any Award or Award Agreement.
(b) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Board may, at any time and from time to time, without any further action of the Committee, exercise the powers and duties of the Committee under the Plan.
Power and Authority of the Board
 
(a) . Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the aggregate number of Shares that may be issued under all Awards under the Plan shall be 250,000. If an Award terminates or is forfeited or cancelled without the issuance of any Shares, or if any Shares covered by an Award or to which an Award relates are not issued for any other reason, then the number of Shares counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award, to the extent of any such termination, forfeiture, cancellation or other event, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan. If Shares of Restricted Stock are forfeited or otherwise reacquired by the Company prior to vesting, whether or not dividends have been paid on such Shares, then the number of Shares counted against the aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan with respect to such Award of Restricted Stock, to the extent of any such forfeiture or reacquisition by the Company, shall again be available for granting Awards under the Plan. Shares that are withheld in full or partial payment to the Company of the purchase or exercise price relating to an Award shall not be available for granting Awards under the Plan.
Shares Available
(b) . For purposes of this Section 4, if an Award entitles the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares, the number of Shares covered by such Award or to which such Award relates shall be counted on the date of grant of such Award against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. For Stock Appreciation Rights settled in Shares upon exercise, the aggregate number of Shares with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is granted, rather than the number of Shares actually issued upon exercise, shall be counted against the number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan. Awards that do not entitle the holder thereof to receive or purchase Shares and Awards that are settled in cash shall not be counted against the aggregate number of Shares available for Awards under the Plan.
Accounting for Awards
(c) . In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the Company or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares such that an adjustment is necessary in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in such manner as it deems equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) which thereafter may be made the subject of Awards, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities or other property) subject to outstanding Awards and (iii) the purchase or exercise price with respect to any Award; , that the number of Shares covered by any Award or to which such Award relates shall always be a whole number. Such adjustment shall be made by the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
Adjustments
provided, however
 
(a) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Options to Non-Employee Directors with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
Options
(i) . The purchase price per Share purchasable under an Option shall be determined by the Committee; , that such purchase price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such Option.
Exercise Price
provided, however
 
(ii) . The term of each Option shall be fixed by the Committee but shall not be longer than 10 years from the date of grant.
Option Term
(iii) . The Committee shall determine the time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in part. The minimum vesting period of Options shall be three years from the date of grant, unless vesting of the Option is conditioned on performance of the Company or an Affiliate or on personal performance (other than continued service with the Company or an Affiliate), in which case the minimum vesting period of Options shall be at least one year from the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may permit acceleration of vesting of Options in the event of the Participant's death, disability or retirement or a change in control of the Company. The Committee shall also determine the method or methods by which, and the form or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof, having a Fair Market Value on the exercise date equal to the applicable exercise price) in which, payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may be made or deemed to have been made.
Time and Method of Exercise
(b) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Non-Employee Directors subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement. A Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall confer on the holder thereof a right to receive upon exercise thereof the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of exercise (or, if the Committee shall so determine, at any time during a specified period before or after the date of exercise) over (ii) the grant price of the Stock Appreciation Right as specified by the Committee, which price shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one Share on the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, the grant price, term, methods of exercise, dates of exercise, methods of settlement and any other terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right shall be as determined by the Committee; , that the term of each Stock Appreciation Right shall not be longer than 10 years from the date of grant. The Committee may impose such conditions or restrictions on the exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right as it may deem appropriate.
Stock Appreciation Rights
provided, however
(c) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units to Non-Employee Directors with the following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee shall determine:
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
(i) . Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may impose (including, without limitation, any limitation on the right to vote a Share of Restricted Stock or the right to receive any dividend or other right or property with respect thereto), which restrictions may lapse separately or in combination at such time or times or upon achievement of established performance goals, in such installments or otherwise as the Committee may deem appropriate. Such Awards shall vest, in installments or otherwise, over at least a three-year period from the date of grant, unless the Award is conditioned on performance of the Company or an Affiliate or on personal performance (other than continued service with the Company or an Affiliate), in which case the minimum vesting period of such Award shall be at least one year from the date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may permit acceleration of vesting of such Awards in the event of the Participant's death, disability or retirement or a change in control of the Company.
Restrictions
(ii) . Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted and may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate, including book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates, which certificate or certificates shall be held by the Company. Such certificate or certificates shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock. Shares representing Restricted Stock that is no longer subject to restrictions shall be delivered to the Participant promptly after the applicable restrictions lapse or are waived. In the case of Restricted Stock Units, no Shares shall be issued at the time such Awards are granted. Upon the lapse or waiver of restrictions and the restricted period relating to Restricted Stock Units evidencing the right to receive Shares, such Shares shall be issued and delivered to the holder of the Restricted Stock Units.
Issuance and Delivery of Shares
 
(iii) . Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a Participant's resignation or removal as a Director (in either case, as determined by the Committee) during the applicable restriction period, all Shares of Restricted Stock and all Restricted Stock Units held by the Participant at such time shall be forfeited and reacquired by the Company; provided, however, that the Committee may, when it finds that a waiver would be in the best interest of the Company, waive in whole or in part any or all remaining restrictions with respect to Shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.
Forfeiture
(d) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant "Dividend Equivalents" to Non-Employee Directors under which the Participant shall be entitled to receive payments (in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property as determined in the discretion of the Committee) equivalent to the amount of cash dividends paid by the Company to holders of Shares with respect to a number of Shares determined by the Committee. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, such Dividend Equivalents may have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may not grant Dividend Equivalents to Non-Employee Directors in connection with grants of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights to such Non-Employee Directors.
Dividend Equivalents
(e) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Non-Employee Directors Shares without restrictions thereon, as deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, such Stock Awards may have such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine.
Stock Awards
(f) . The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Non-Employee Directors such other Awards that are denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation, securities convertible into Shares), as are deemed by the Committee to be consistent with the purpose of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards, subject to the terms of the Plan and the Award Agreement. Shares, or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted under this Section 5(g), shall be purchased for consideration having a value equal to at least 100% of the Fair Market Value of such Shares or other securities on the date the purchase right is granted. The consideration paid by the Participant may be paid by such method or methods and in such form or forms (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof), as the Committee shall determine.
Other Stock-Based Awards
(g) .
General
(i) . Awards may be granted for no cash consideration or for any cash or other consideration as may be determined by the Committee or required by applicable law.
Consideration for Awards
(ii) . Awards may, in the discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with or in substitution for any other Award or any award granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate. Awards granted in addition to or in tandem with other Awards or in addition to or in tandem with awards granted under any other plan of the Company or any Affiliate may be granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards.
Awards May Be Granted Separately or Together
(iii) . Subject to the terms of the Plan and of any applicable Award Agreement, payments or transfers to be made by the Company or an Affiliate upon the grant, exercise or payment of an Award may be made in such form or forms as the Committee shall determine (including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property, or any combination thereof), and may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments or on a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. Such rules and procedures may include, without limitation, provisions for the payment or crediting of reasonable interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or crediting of Dividend Equivalents with respect to installment or deferred payments.

(v) . Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5(g)(v), no Award (other than a Stock Award) and no right under any such Award shall be transferable by a Participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. The Committee may establish procedures as it deems appropriate for a Participant to designate a Person or Persons, as beneficiary or beneficiaries, to exercise the rights of the Participant and receive any property distributable with respect to any Award in the event of the Participant's death. The Committee, in its discretion and subject to such additional terms and conditions as it determines, may permit a Participant to transfer an Option to any "family member" (as such term is defined in the General Instructions to Form S-8 (or any successor to such Instructions or such Form) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) at any time that such Participant holds such Option, provided that such transfers may not be for value (i.e., the transferor may not receive any consideration therefor) and the family member may not make any subsequent transfers other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Each Award under the Plan or right under any such Award shall be exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the Participant (except as provided herein or in an Award Agreement or amendment thereto relating to an Option) or, if permissible under applicable law, by the Participant's guardian or legal representative. No Award (other than a Stock Award) or right under any such Award may be pledged, alienated, attached or otherwise encumbered, and any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof shall be void and unenforceable against the Company or any Affiliate.
Limits on Transfer of Awards
(vi) . All Shares or other securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the exercise thereof shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the Plan, applicable federal or state securities laws and regulatory requirements, and the Committee may cause appropriate entries to be made or legends to be placed on the certificates for such Shares or other securities to reflect such restrictions. If the Shares or other securities are traded on a securities exchange, the Company shall not be required to deliver any Shares or other securities covered by an Award unless and until such Shares or other securities have been admitted for trading on such securities exchange.
Restrictions; Securities Exchange Listing
(vii) . Except as provided in Section 4(c) hereof, no Option may be amended to reduce its initial exercise price, no Option may be cancelled and replaced with an Option or Options having a lower exercise price and no Option that is underwater may be cancelled and exchanged for cash or another Award.

Exhibit 99.1
 
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (August 8, 2011)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced that Joseph F. Puishys will join the company as CEO and president, effective Monday, August 22. Puishys, 53, who also becomes a member of Apogee's board of directors, comes from Fortune 100 manufacturer Honeywell and is an industry veteran, with a proven track record of success in leadership positions. Apogee embarked on a national search for its next CEO following Russ Huffer's announcement of his planned retirement after a 25-year career with Apogee. With Puishys' appointment, Huffer is stepping down as CEO and board director.
"Russ Huffer leaves behind a legacy of growth and innovation at Apogee. We thank Russ for his leadership and many years of service, and are pleased to welcome Joe. He is an accomplished leader who brings vast experience and a track record of improving and growing businesses," said Bernard P. Aldrich, chairman of Apogee's board. "As the economy recovers, Joe is the ideal executive to lead the Apogee team to capitalize on the future growth opportunities that we see."
Puishys has 32 years experience in manufacturing businesses, since 2008 as president of Honeywell's Environmental and Combustion Controls division, a $3 billion business. Prior to that, he led Honeywell Building Solutions, a global leader in the installation and service of integrated building solutions. He also held leadership positions in companies that were eventually bought by Honeywell, including Bendix Friction Materials and Garrett Engine Boosting System. He has also served in numerous executive and financial positions across Honeywell's businesses. As president of Honeywell Building Solutions, Puishys received several awards from Honeywell for the turnaround of the commercial construction business.
Apogee has transformed to become a world-class provider of value-added glass solutions for enclosing commercial buildings and framing art. With his direct industry experience, Puishys will focus on leveraging Apogee's existing and new energy-efficient products for new construction and renovation, improving margins through productivity enhancements, and growing the company's international architectural glass business.

"I look forward to putting my commercial building and manufacturing background to work to lead Apogee," said Puishys. "I am excited about the growth opportunities to expand into new geographies and targeted sectors to better serve the needs of our markets."
Puishys received his bachelor's degree in accounting and finance from Bryant University and his master's in business administration from Providence College.

Forward-Looking Statements
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Latin American commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and v) integration of the Brazilian architectural glass business; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix and new competition; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) ability to effectively manage executive transitions; iii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iv) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain continuing operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

For Immediate Release
Wednesday, September 14, 2011
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (September 14, 2011)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2012 second-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY12 SECOND QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commentary
"Within the second quarter results are several positives," said Joseph F. Puishys, Apogee chief executive officer. "We grew revenues organically while substantially reducing architectural segment losses, and we were nearly at breakeven excluding the CEO transition costs. We also had positive cash flow from operations, and maintained our solid cash and short-term investments position. In addition, we believe the architectural segment backlog trend remains positive, as the decline from the first quarter resulted from the timing of contract signings."

OUTLOOK
"For fiscal 2012, we continue to expect revenue growth to exceed 10 percent, and that Apogee will be slightly profitable for the year. We also expect Apogee to generate positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012," Puishys said. "Our outlook for fiscal 2012 requires us to fill some fourth quarter architectural segment capacity. We expect to maintain the improved architectural glass pricing and mix, as well as the share gain in our window and storefront businesses, which will be somewhat offset by lower margins in the installation business as it executes projects bid at the cycle trough.

"Apogee continues to see good bidding activity, which is starting to move beyond institutional projects to other sectors," Puishys said. "A concern as the quarter ended is the softening in domestic commercial construction market indicators. The recent McGraw-Hill Construction forecast for non-residential construction and the American Institute of Architects Architecture Billings Index indicate that our end markets will not improve until calendar 2012, rather than later in 2011.
"I am excited to be at the helm of this financially strong U.S. green building leader. I am focused on operational improvements, and developing and executing strategies to grow our business at home and internationally," he said.

NEWS RELEASE
 
For Immediate Release
Wednesday, December 14, 2011
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (December 14, 2011)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2012 third-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY12 THIRD QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
 
 
 
 
Backlog was maintained at $231 million from the second quarter.
 
Commentary
"I am pleased to report very positive results for the third quarter, as we returned to quarterly earnings and grew revenues significantly," said Joseph F. Puishys, Apogee chief executive officer. "The architectural segment moved to profitability on strong third-quarter revenues and maintained its backlog on increased order flow, and the large-scale optical segment revenues increased. We achieved excellent top-line growth in both segments, given current market conditions.
"During the quarter, we also had solid balance sheet performance with cash flow from operations of $10 million," he said. "In addition, we maintained our cash and short-term investments position from the second quarter after using $2.4 million in cash to repurchase shares in the current period."
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

FY12 THIRD-QUARTER SEGMENT AND OPERATING RESULTS VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
Architectural Products and Services
 
 
 
 
 
Approximately $96 million, or 41 percent, of the backlog is expected to be delivered in fiscal 2012; approximately $126 million, or 55 percent, in fiscal 2013; and approximately $9 million, or 4 percent in fiscal 2014.
Awarded projects awaiting final signed contracts held at the second quarter level of approximately $60 million.
Large-Scale Optical Technologies
 
 
Operating margin in the seasonally strong quarter declined to 32.5 percent, compared to 34.5 percent, due to spending on growth initiatives.
Financial Condition
 
Long-term debt includes $20.4 million in long-term, low-interest industrial revenue and recovery zone facility bonds.
Cash and short-term investments totaled $46.4 million, compared to $45.3 million at the end of the second quarter and $60.6 million at the end of fiscal 2011.
 
 
 
 
OUTLOOK
"With the strong third-quarter performance, we have increased our fiscal 2012 full-year outlook," Puishys said. "We now anticipate that revenues will increase approximately 14 percent, up from prior expectations of more than 10 percent growth, and our full-year earnings per share should be at least $0.07. We also expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in fiscal 2012.
 
Apogee Enterprises, Inc.

"We expect to be slightly profitable for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, as we anticipate that our fourth quarter revenues will be down sequentially from the third quarter due to architectural project timing and large-scale optical seasonality," he said. "That said, we expect to deliver revenue and income growth in the fourth quarter, compared to the prior-year period." He added that Apogee continues to see good bidding activity.
"I am encouraged that Apogee's performance is improving, in part driven by operational improvements we are making, and look forward to executing strategies to grow our business at home and internationally as we move ahead," he said.

Item 5.04. Temporary Suspension of Trading Under Registrant's Employee Benefit Plans.
Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") has elected to change the record keeper for the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 401(k) Retirement Plan (the "Plan"). As a result of this change, there will be a blackout period in which Plan participants and beneficiaries temporarily will be unable to (i) direct or diversify investments in their individual accounts or (ii) obtain a distribution from the Plan. The blackout period will begin at 3:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time on April 26, 2012, and is expected to end the week of May 6, 2012 (the "Blackout Period").
The Company received notice of the Blackout Period required by Section 101(i)(2)(E) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 on March 21, 2012.
On March 27, 2012, the Company sent a notice of the Blackout Period (the "Blackout Period Notice") to the members of its Board of Directors and executive officers pursuant to Section 306 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 104 of Regulation BTR of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, informing them that they would be prohibited during the Blackout Period from purchasing and selling shares of the Company's common stock (including derivative securities pertaining to such shares) that they acquire or have previously acquired in connection with their service or employment as a director or executive officer of the Company.

For Immediate Release
Wednesday, April 11, 2012
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (April 11, 2012)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal 2012 full-year and fourth-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.

Commentary
"We finished the year strong with another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, significant earnings improvement, very positive cash flow and continued increase in our backlog," said Joseph F. Puishys, Apogee chief executive officer. "Our year-over-year improvement was particularly strong in the architectural segment. However, our large-scale optical picture framing glass business continued to deliver solid results.
"In flat market conditions, Apogee grew 14 percent over fiscal 2011 due to share gains, geographic growth, pricing and the acquisition of the Brazilian architectural glass business, which contributed 5 points of the growth," he said. "Both the architectural and large-scale optical segments grew organically more than their markets.
"The $0.23 improvement in fourth-quarter earnings per share mirrored a similar third-quarter improvement. The result was a full-year improvement of $0.68 per share from continuing operations, with each quarter reflecting year-over-year improvement," said Puishys. "The quality of earnings was evident in our strong cash and short-term investments growth of approximately $20 million in the year.
"Finally, I was most pleased with the increase in our architectural segment backlog to $242 million, giving us a strong position as we enter fiscal 2013," he said.

OUTLOOK
"We expect continued revenue and earnings growth for Apogee in fiscal 2013, as our architectural business continues to gain market share," said Puishys. "At the same time, we'll be focused on operational improvements, new product introductions and international opportunities that we expect will benefit us this year and into the future.
"We are anticipating mid-single digit revenue growth for fiscal 2013, in part coming from continued U.S. geographic expansion in our installation and storefront businesses," he said. "Our fiscal 2013 outlook for earnings per share is $0.40 to $0.50, as we expect to benefit from a full year of improved architectural glass pricing, higher installation margins in the second half and the ongoing strong performance of our picture framing glass business." He noted that Apogee expects to return to its normal tax rate in fiscal 2013.
"In addition, we are expecting positive free cash flow after spending capital of approximately $25 million for investments in new products, capacity, productivity improvements and international, as well as for maintenance requirements," he said.
"We have a solid architectural backlog starting the year and are experiencing good bidding activity at improved margins," noted Puishys. "Also, our second half should be better than the first half of fiscal 2013 due to an expected first-quarter gap in project flow and improvement in commercial construction market conditions occurring in the second half.
"Apogee is gaining momentum as our performance improves and we begin to implement strategies to grow our business at home and internationally," he said.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, Apogee has presented free cash flow and non-cash working capital. Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Non-cash working capital is defined as current assets, excluding cash and short-term investments, less current liabilities. Apogee believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances communications as they provide more transparency into management's performance with respect to cash and current assets and liabilities. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Latin American commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and v) integration of the Brazilian architectural glass business; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix and new competition; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) ability to effectively manage executive transitions; iii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iv) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; v) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and vi) foreign currency risk related to certain continuing operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 26, 2011.

On April 26, 2012, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Bonus Pool Award Agreement with each of the executive officers listed below, which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the executive officer may receive an annual bonus award under the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2012 Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "Executive MIP") if the Executive MIP is approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The agreement provides that the executive officer's right to receive an annual cash bonus award will be determined based on the attainment of certain pre-set performance metrics for the fiscal year.
The performance metric to be used to establish the bonus pool under the Executive MIP for fiscal 2013 is operating income. The performance metrics to be used for determining awards under the Executive MIP for fiscal 2013 for the executive officers listed below are net sales, earnings per share and days working capital. The table below sets forth certain information with respect to fiscal 2013 annual bonus award payout ranges as a percentage of fiscal 2013 salary for the listed executive officers based on performance at the threshold, target and maximum performance levels.
 
 
In the event an executive officer's employment is terminated during a fiscal year for any reason other than Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined in the agreement) or death, the agreement provides that the executive officer will forfeit any and all rights under the Executive MIP and the agreement relating to such fiscal year. In accordance with the agreement, if an executive officer's employment with the Company is terminated during the fiscal year as a result of Disability, Retirement or death, the executive officer, or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, will receive a pro-rata cash payment after the end of the fiscal year to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metric is achieved.
The form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement used in connection with annual bonus awards under the Executive MIP is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference (the "Form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement").
 
Performance Awards
At the meetings of the Company's Compensation Committee (the "Committee") and Board of Directors (the "Board") held on April 26 and 27, 2012, the executive officers listed below were awarded performance awards representing the right to receive a cash payment from the Company up to the maximum amount set forth below (the "Performance Awards").
 
The Performance Awards were awarded pursuant to the shareholder-approved Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (2011) (the "Stock Incentive Plan"), a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 28, 2011. The form of Performance Award Agreement used in connection with the awards to the executive officers listed above and to be used on a going-forward basis for performance awards under the Stock Incentive Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference (the "Form of Performance Award Agreement").
The amount of cash to be paid to each executive officer pursuant to the Performance Award (the "Cash Payment") will be based on whether and to what extent the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics for the period commencing on March 4, 2012 and ending on March 1, 2014 (the "Performance Period") is achieved. The performance metrics for the Performance Period are cumulative net sales, cumulative earnings per share and average return on invested capital. The threshold, target and maximum amounts set forth above represent the Cash Payment amounts to be made to each executive officer if the Company achieved all of the performance metrics at the threshold, target or maximum level, respectively. The executive officer will receive a Cash Payment pursuant to the Performance Award if one or more performance metrics is achieved at or above the threshold level. The determination of the Cash Payment amount will occur as soon as practicable after the Committee determines whether, and the extent to which, the performance metrics have been achieved (the "Determination Date"). Following the Determination Date, the Company will pay to the executive officer one-half of the Cash Payment (the "Initial Payment"). On the one year anniversary of the last day of the Performance Period (the "Fully-Vested Date"), the Company will pay to the executive officer the remaining one-half of the Cash Payment (the "Final Payment").
In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the Fully-Vested Date, the Performance Award and any unpaid Cash Payment shall be immediately forfeited, unless the executive officer's employment is terminated by reason of the executive officer's Retirement or Disability (as such terms are defined in the award agreement) or death. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Performance Period by reason of Retirement, Disability or death, the executive officer or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive a pro-rata portion (based on the amount of time elapsed between the beginning of the Performance Period and the date of termination) of the Cash Payment after the end of the Performance Period to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics is achieved. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated after the Performance Period by reason of Retirement, Disability or death, the executive officer or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive the Initial Payment (if not yet paid to the executive officer) and the Final Payment. The Company will pay the Initial Payment following the Determination Date and the Final Payment on the Fully-Vested Date.
 
If a Change in Control (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan) of the Company occurs during the Performance Period, then for purposes of determining the Cash Payment amount, the Performance Period shall be deemed to end on the date of the Change in Control. The Cash Payment amount will be based on the extent of achievement of the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metrics, as adjusted for the truncated Performance Period and determined by the Committee. The Cash Payment to be paid to the executive officer will be paid in full in a single lump sum payment as soon as administratively feasible following the Determination Date. If a Change in Control of the Company occurs after the Performance Period, then the executive officer will be entitled to receive the Initial Payment (if not yet paid to the executive officer) and the Final Payment as soon as administratively feasible following the date of the Change in Control.
Time-Based Restricted Stock Awards
At Committee and Board meetings held on April 26 and 27, 2012, the executive officers listed below were awarded shares of time-based restricted stock in the amounts indicated below.
 
Such restricted stock awards were made pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan. The form of Restricted Stock Agreement used in connection with restricted stock awards under the Stock Incentive Plan, including the awards to the executive officers listed above, a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.3 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 2, 2011 (the "Form of Restricted Stock Agreement"), is incorporated herein by reference.
The shares of restricted stock vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary date of such grant (such three-year period is referred to herein as the "Restricted Period"). In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Restricted Period by reason of Retirement (as defined in the agreement) or involuntary termination without Cause (as defined in the agreement), the Committee has the right to cause the remaining unvested shares to be accelerated as of the date of such Retirement or involuntary termination without Cause. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Restricted Period by reason of Disability or death, the shares of restricted stock will become immediately vested in full.
In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan) during the Restricted Period and the executive officer's employment is simultaneously or subsequently terminated by the Company without Cause or by the executive officer for Good Reason (as defined in the agreement) during the Restricted Period, the restrictions with respect to all of the shares held by the executive officer at the time of termination shall lapse and the shares shall immediately vest as of the date of such termination of employment.
The descriptions in this Current Report on Form 8-K of the Form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement and the Form of Performance Award Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the attached copies of the agreements. The description in this Current Report on Form 8-K of the Form of Restricted Stock Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of such agreement that is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.3 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 2, 2011.

Commentary
"We started the new year with strong earnings on revenues that grew 1 percent," said Joseph F. Puishys, Apogee chief executive officer. "With strong orders and awards leading to an architectural backlog increase of 13 percent, we have confidence in our planned growth for the full year.
"Gross and operating margins for both our architectural and large-scale optical segments improved year on year, and we operated well throughout Apogee's businesses," he said. "Cash and short-term investments ended at $58 million after normal first-quarter seasonal uses and capital investments for growth and productivity enhancements, with ongoing positive working capital performance."

OUTLOOK
"With our first-quarter earnings and strong backlog, we are more confident in our revenue forecast and have greater visibility into the mix of projects we will be executing over the remainder of the year, allowing us to increase our earnings outlook for fiscal 2013 to $0.48 to $0.58 per share, from $0.40 to $0.50 per share, on mid single-digit revenue growth," said Puishys. "Our anticipated revenue growth for fiscal 2013 will come in part from continued U.S. geographic expansion in our installation and storefront businesses, while earnings for the year are expected to benefit from improved architectural glass pricing, higher project margins in the second half and the ongoing strong performance of our picture framing glass and acrylic business.
"I am pleased by the first-quarter growth in our architectural backlog at improving margins," noted Puishys. "Based on the margins of projects in our backlog and our continued outlook for mid-single digit revenue growth for the year, we anticipate that our second half will be better than the first half of fiscal 2013.
"For the full year, we continue to expect positive free cash flow after spending capital of approximately $25 million for investments to improve productivity, increase capacity and introduce new products, as well as for maintenance requirements," he said.
"I believe that our focus on operational improvements, new product introductions and geographic expansion will deliver improving top and bottom-line results during fiscal 2013 and beyond," Puishys
said. "Apogee is a great company with significant opportunities to grow our business at home and internationally."

ABOUT APOGEE ENTERPRISES
Apogee Enterprises, Inc., headquartered in Minneapolis, is a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value-added glass products and services. The company is organized in two segments:
 
 
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, Apogee has presented free cash flow and non-cash working capital. Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Non-cash working capital is defined as current assets, excluding cash and short-term investments, less current liabilities. Apogee believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances communications as they provide more transparency into management's performance with respect to cash and current assets and liabilities. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The discussion above contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Latin American commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix and new competition; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iii) self-insurance risk related

to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and v) foreign currency risk related to certain continuing operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2012.

Approval of the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2012 Executive Management Incentive Plan
On June 21, 2012, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company"), the Company's shareholders approved the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2012 Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "2012 Executive MIP"). The Company's Board of Directors adopted the 2012 Executive MIP in April 2012, subject to shareholder approval.
The 2012 Executive MIP is intended to provide the Company's executive officers with a direct financial incentive to make significant contributions to the achievement of the annual strategic and financial goals of the Company. The 2012 Executive MIP entitles each participant to receive a cash bonus payment after the end of a fiscal year if the applicable performance goals for payment of the bonus have been satisfied. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Company's Compensation Committee establishes a "bonus pool" equal to a percentage (not in excess of 100%) of one or more specific, objective, predetermined performance goals selected by the Compensation Committee from the business criteria listed in the 2012 Executive MIP. At the time the pool is established, the Compensation Committee determines a maximum percentage of the pool reserved for each eligible executive officer. The percentage need not be the same for each award recipient, but the aggregate for the group as a whole cannot exceed 100% of the pool. The amount payable under the award depends on the amount of the performance goal generated by the Company, as well as the achievement of such other conditions as the Compensation Committee may establish in its sole discretion. The Compensation Committee has complete discretionary authority to reduce the amount of a bonus that otherwise would be payable to any participant under the 2012 Executive MIP. The maximum bonus that may be paid to any participant pursuant to the 2012 Executive MIP in any fiscal year may not exceed $3,000,000. The 2012 Executive MIP is designed to ensure that payments of cash incentive compensation under the plan will be fully deductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for the next five fiscal years.
The 2012 Executive MIP became effective as of March 4, 2012, the first day of fiscal 2013. The Compensation Committee may amend, alter or discontinue the 2012 Executive MIP at any time in its sole discretion, except that, without approval of the Company's shareholders, the Compensation Committee may not make any amendments or other modifications that, absent approval of the shareholders, would cause any compensation paid pursuant to any award under the 2012 Executive MIP no longer to qualify as "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. No annual bonus awards may be granted under the Company's 2012 Executive MIP after February 25, 2017.
This summary of the 2012 Executive MIP is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2012 Executive MIP, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference. A more detailed summary of the 2012 Executive MIP can be found in the Company's Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 8, 2012.
Change in Control Severance Agreement with Mark R. Augdahl
On June 21, 2012, the Board of Directors approved the Company entering into a change in control severance agreement (the "CIC Severance Agreement") with Mark R. Augdahl, the Company's Vice President Finance and Corporate Controller. The CIC Severance Agreement is based on the form of change in control severance agreement approved by the Company in January 2011 and filed with the SEC.
The CIC Severance Agreement is a "double trigger" agreement. It provides that, in the event of a change in control of the Company, Mr. Augdahl will have specific rights and receive specified benefits if his employment is terminated without "cause" or if he voluntarily terminates his employment for "good reason" within two years after the change in control (the 10
th
business day following such employment termination date is referred to herein as the "Employment Termination Date"). (The terms "change in control," "cause," and "good reason" are defined in the CIC Severance Agreement.) In these circumstances, Mr. Augdahl will receive a severance payment equal to one times his annual salary plus his targeted annual bonus (as calculated under the terms of the CIC Severance Agreement). In addition, all options and restricted stock awards held by Mr. Augdahl that have not vested by the Employment Termination Date will be immediately vested on such date. Following the Employment Termination
 
Date, the CIC Severance Agreement provides that, for a 12-month period following a change in control, the Company will continue to provide medical and dental insurance coverage for Mr. Augdahl and his dependents or will reimburse Mr. Augdahl for the cost of obtaining substantially similar benefits. No benefits will be paid to Mr. Augdahl pursuant to the CIC Severance Agreement unless he executes and delivers to the Company a release of claims.
During Mr. Augdahl's employment with the Company and for a 12-month period following his Employment Termination Date, provided that the amounts owed to Mr. Augdahl pursuant to the CIC Severance Agreement have been paid, Mr. Augdahl shall not: (1) solicit, directly or indirectly, any existing or prospective customers, vendors or suppliers of the Company or its affiliates for a purpose competitive to the Company's business or to encourage such customers, vendors or suppliers to terminate business with the Company or its affiliates; (2) solicit, directly or indirectly, any employee of the Company or its affiliates to terminate his or her employment; or (3) engage in or carry on, directly or indirectly, in certain geographic markets, a business competitive with the Company's business.
The CIC Severance Agreement continues through December 31 of each year and will be automatically extended for one-year terms prior to a change in control unless the Company gives prior notice of termination.
The foregoing description of the CIC Severance Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of change in control severance agreement which was filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 3, 2011 and which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
At the Annual Meeting, the shareholders voted on the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(d) Exhibits.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 10.1
Section 1. Purpose
The purpose of the Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2012 Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is to provide a direct financial incentive for executive officers of Apogee Enterprises, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the "Company"), to make a significant contribution to the annual strategic and financial goals of the Company.
Section 2. Establishment of Bonus Pool
The Committee (as defined in Section 3(a)) shall, not later than 90 days after the beginning of each fiscal year of the Company, establish a bonus pool (the "Bonus Pool") equal to a percentage (not to exceed 100%) of one or more of the following business criteria ("Company Performance Factors") for the fiscal year for which Annual Bonus Pool Awards are being paid under this Plan. At the time that the Committee establishes the Bonus Pool, the likelihood that the Company will achieve any of the Company Performance Factors upon which the Bonus Pool is based must be substantially uncertain. The following shall constitute the sole Company Performance Factors upon which a Bonus Pool under this Plan shall be based: economic value added, sales or revenues, costs or expenses, net profit after tax, gross profit, operating profit, base earnings, earnings (whether before or after taxes), earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a percent of net sales, return on actual or pro forma equity or net assets or capital, net capital employed, earnings per share (basic or diluted), earnings per share from continuing operations, operating income, pre-tax income, operating income margin, net income, total shareholder return or profitability, or both, as measured by one or more of the following accounting ratios: return on revenue, return on assets, return on equity, return on invested capital and return on investments, shareholder return including performance (total shareholder return) relative to the Standard & Poor's Small Cap 600 Index or similar index or performance (total shareholder return) relative to the proxy comparator group, in both cases as determined pursuant to Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, cash generation, cash flow (including free cash flow and cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities or any combination thereof), unit volume and change in working capital.
The Bonus Pool shall be computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time and as applied by the Company in the preparation of its financial statements. For purposes of the foregoing computation, changes in generally accepted accounting principles which occur during a fiscal year shall not be taken into account, and extraordinary items, discontinued operations and restructuring costs, as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time and as applied and reported by the Company in the preparation of its financial statements, shall also not be taken into account. The amount of any Bonus Pool may be decreased (but not increased) at any time during a fiscal year by the Committee.
Section 3. Administration
(a) . The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors, or a sub-committee thereof (the "Committee"). To the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Committee administering the Plan shall be composed solely of two or more "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Composition of the Committee
(b) . The Committee shall have full power and authority, subject to all the applicable provisions of the Plan (including but not limited to the requirements of Section 4(d) of the Plan) and applicable law, to (i) establish, amend, suspend, terminate or waive such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as it deems necessary or advisable for the proper administration of the Plan, (ii) construe, interpret and administer the Plan and any instrument or agreement relating to, or any Annual Bonus Pool Award (as defined below in Section 4(b)) made under, the Plan, and (iii) make all other determinations and take all other actions necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, each determination made and each action taken by the Committee pursuant to the Plan or any instrument or agreement relating to, or any Annual Bonus Pool Award made under, the Plan shall be within the sole discretion of the Committee, may be made at any time and shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes on all persons,
Power and Authority of the Committee
 
including, but not limited to, holders of Annual Bonus Pool Awards, and their legal representatives and beneficiaries, and employees of the Company or of any "Affiliate" of the Company. For purposes of the Plan and any instrument or agreement relating to, or any Annual Bonus Pool Award made under, the Plan, the term "Affiliate" shall mean any entity that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, is controlled by the Company and any entity in which the Company has a significant equity interest, in each case as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.
(c) . The Committee may delegate its powers and duties under the Plan to one or more executive officers of the Company or any Affiliate or a committee of such executive officers, subject to such terms, conditions and limitations as the Committee may establish in its sole discretion; , , that the Committee shall not delegate its power to (i) amend the Plan as provided in Section 10 hereof; (ii) establish a Bonus Pool under Section 2; or (iii) make determinations regarding Performance-Based Awards (as defined below in Section 4(d)).

Section 4. Eligibility and Participation
(a) . The Plan is maintained by the Company for its executive officers. In order to be eligible to participate in the Plan, an executive officer of the Company or any of its Affiliates must be selected by the Committee. In determining the executive officers who will participate in the Plan, the Committee may take into account the nature of the services rendered by such executive officers, their present and potential contributions to the success of the Company and such other factors as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall deem relevant. A director of the Company or of an Affiliate who is not also an employee of the Company or an Affiliate, and all members of the Committee, shall not be eligible to participate in the Plan.

The percentage share of the Bonus Pool need not be the same with respect to any recipient of an Annual Bonus Pool Award (the "Participant") or with respect to different Participants. The Committee's decision to approve an Annual Bonus Pool Award to an employee in any year shall not require the Committee to approve a similar Annual Bonus Pool Award or any Annual Bonus Pool Award at all to that employee or any other employee or person at any future date. The Company and the Committee shall not have any obligation for uniformity of treatment of any person, including, but not limited to, Participants and their legal representatives and beneficiaries and employees of the Company or of any Affiliate of the Company. The Committee retains sole discretion to reduce the amount of any bonus otherwise payable under this Plan. The Annual Bonus Pool Award in a subsequent fiscal year shall not be increased by any portion of the Bonus Pool of a prior fiscal year which has not been paid or credited to or for the benefit of Participants hereunder.
(c) . Any employee selected for participation by the Committee shall, as a condition of participation, execute and return to the Committee a written agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of the Annual Bonus Pool Award (the "Bonus Pool Award Agreement").

In the absence of any specific agreement to the contrary, no Annual Bonus Pool Award to a Participant under the Plan shall affect any right of the Company, or of any Affiliate of the Company, to terminate, with or without cause, the Participant's employment with the Company or any Affiliate at any time. Neither the establishment of the Plan, nor the granting of any Annual Bonus Pool Award hereunder, shall give any Participant: (i) any rights to remain employed by the Company or any Affiliate; (ii) any benefits not specifically provided for herein or in any Annual Bonus Pool Award granted hereunder; or (iii) any rights to prevent the Company or any Affiliate from modifying, amending or terminating any of its other benefit plans of any nature whatsoever.

Amendments to and Termination of Plan
provided
however
(c) .

Correction of Defects, Omissions and Inconsistencies
Section 11. Miscellaneous
(a) . The Plan and any Bonus Pool Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws, and not the laws of conflicts, of the State of Minnesota.
Governing Law
(b) . If any provision of the Plan, any Annual Bonus Pool Award or any Bonus Pool Award Agreement is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction or would disqualify the Plan, any Annual Bonus Pool Award or any Bonus Pool Award Agreement under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the purpose or intent of the Plan, the Annual Bonus Pool Award or the Bonus Pool Award Agreement, such provision shall be stricken as to such jurisdiction, and the remainder of the Plan, any such Annual Bonus Pool Award or any such Bonus Pool Award Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
Severability
(c) . Neither the Plan nor any Annual Bonus Pool Award or Bonus Pool Award Agreement shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any Affiliate and a Participant or any other person. To the extent that any person acquires a
No Trust or Fund Created
 
right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate pursuant to an Annual Bonus Pool Award, such right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company or of any Affiliate.
(d) . Any and all cash payments pursuant to any Annual Bonus Pool Award granted hereunder shall constitute special incentive payments to the Participant, and such payments shall not be taken into account in computing the amount of the Participant's salary or compensation for purposes of determining any pension, retirement, death or other benefits under (i) any pension, retirement, profit sharing, bonus, life insurance or other employee benefit plan of the Company or any Affiliate or (ii) any agreement between the Company (or any Affiliate) and the Participant, except to the extent that such plan or agreement expressly provides to the contrary.
Nature of Payments
(e) . Headings are given to the Sections of the Plan solely as a convenience to facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the Plan or any provision thereof.

FY13 SECOND QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
Commentary
We delivered a better than expected second quarter, and in flat markets grew revenues 6 percent and improved earnings by 24 cents per share, said Joseph F. Puishys, Apogee chief executive officer. Im pleased that the architectural segment returned to profitability in the quarter. In addition, both our architectural and large-scale optical segments grew their top and bottom lines, as well as their margins, and all our operations performed well.
Our architectural segment backlog reached its highest level in 12 quarters and grew by more than 30 percent year on year, as our bidding activity strengthens, he said. And, we generated positive cash flow, allowing us to increase our cash and short-term investments position by $23 million after ongoing capital investments for productivity and growth.

OUTLOOK
With our second-quarter earnings, the quality of our architectural backlog and the visibility this backlog provides for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our earnings outlook for fiscal 2013 to $0.56 to $0.64 per share, from $0.48 to $0.58 per share, said Puishys.
We continue to anticipate mid single-digit revenue growth for the full year, despite market indicators pointing to a low- to no-growth year, he said. We believe growth will continue to come from share gain by our architectural businesses.

For the full year, we continue to expect positive free cash flow after spending capital of $25 to $30 million for investments to improve productivity, increase capacity and introduce new products, as well as for maintenance requirements, Puishys said.
I believe that our focus on operational improvements, new geographies, new products and new markets will continue to deliver improving top- and bottom-line results during fiscal 2013 and beyond, Puishys said. Apogee has significant opportunities to grow domestically and internationally.

ABOUT APOGEE ENTERPRISES
Apogee Enterprises, Inc., headquartered in Minneapolis, is a leader in technologies involving the design and development of value-added glass products and services. The company is organized in two segments:
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, Apogee has presented free cash flow and non-cash working capital. Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Non-cash working capital is defined as current assets, excluding cash and short-term investments, less current liabilities. Apogee believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances communications as they provide more transparency into managements performance with respect to cash and current assets and liabilities. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The discussion above contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee managements expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost

increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Latin American commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs, impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segments ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix and new competition; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and v) foreign currency risk related to certain continuing operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the companys results of operations. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or a combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. For a more detailed explanation of the foregoing and other risks and uncertainties, see Item 1A of the companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 3, 2012.

 Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12)
 Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b))

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
As previously disclosed, in January 2011, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Original Agreement"), dated as of January 27, 2011, among the Company, each of the lenders from time to time parties to the Original Agreement (the "Lenders"), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders, swingline lender and issuer of letters of credit. The Original Agreement created a three-year, committed, secured, revolving credit facility in the amount of $80 million (subject to increase under the Original Agreement to an amount not exceeding $120 million). The credit facility included a letter of credit facility in the amount of up to $50 million, the outstanding amounts of which decrease the available commitment.
On October 19, 2012, the Company amended and restated the Original Agreement by entering into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Amended Agreement"), dated as of October 19, 2012, among the Company, the Lenders from time to time parties to the Amended Agreement, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent for the Lenders, swingline lender and issuer of letters of credit.
Consistent with the Original Agreement, under the Amended Agreement the Company may elect the borrowings to bear interest at one of two rates. First, borrowings under the Amended Agreement may be made at an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin (which is calculated based upon the Company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio) and the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the Original Agreement). Second, borrowings under the Amended Agreement may be made at an interest rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base Rate (which is a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the interest rate announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate, (ii) the sum of 0.50% per annum and the federal funds rate in effect on such day, and (iii) LIBOR (as defined in the Original Agreement) plus 1.00%) in effect from time to time, and the Applicable Margin. Pursuant to the Amended Agreement, the Applicable Margin for both LIBOR Rate loans and Base Rate loans, and the rate of commitment fees, were decreased.
The Amended Agreement also amended the terms of the Original Agreement in the following respects:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No other provisions of the Original Agreement were materially amended by the Amended Agreement.
Consistent with the Original Agreement, the Amended Agreement provides that the Company may not be a party to any merger, consolidation or share exchange, or sell, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any substantial part of its assets or property, or in any event sell or discount any of its notes or accounts receivable, or permit any subsidiary to do so; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction does not apply to or operate to prevent (i) the Company being a party to any merger where the Company is the surviving person if, after giving effect to such merger, no Default or Event of Default (both as defined in the Amended Agreement) would then exist, (ii) any
 
subsidiary merging into the Company, being a party to any merger that does not involve the Company where such subsidiary is the surviving person, or being party to an otherwise permitted merger if, after giving effect to such merger, no Default or Event of Default would then exist, (iii) the Company or any subsidiary selling its inventory in the ordinary course of its business, (iv) any dissolution of an inactive subsidiary that would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Amended Agreement), if, after giving effect to such dissolution, no Default or Event of Default would then exist, and (v) any Like-Kind Exchange (as defined in the Amended Agreement).
Similar to the Original Agreement, the Amended Agreement places certain limitations on the payment of cash dividends. It provides that the Company may not declare any dividends (other than dividends payable in capital stock of the Company) on any shares of any class of its capital stock, or set apart any sum for the payment of any dividends on, or make any other distribution by reduction of capital or otherwise in respect of, any shares of any class of capital stock of the Company, unless, immediately after giving effect to such action, there shall not have occurred any Default or Event of Default that is continuing. As noted above, the dollar limitation on the payment of dividends included in the Original Agreement was deleted in the Amended Agreement.
Amounts due under the Amended Agreement may be accelerated upon an Event of Default, such as a breach of a representation or covenant or the occurrence of bankruptcy, if not otherwise waived or cured.
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and certain lenders that are parties to the Agreement have provided, from time to time, and may continue to provide, commercial banking, transfer agent, financial and other services to the Company, including letters of credit, depository and account processing services, for which the Company has paid and intends to pay customary fees.
The foregoing description of the Amended Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
As described under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, on October 19, 2012, the Company entered into a five-year, committed, secured, revolving credit facility in the amount of $100 million (subject to increase under the Amended Agreement to an amount not exceeding $125 million). No amounts have been borrowed under this facility. Schedule 3.1 to the attached Amended Agreement provides information regarding existing letters of credit under the facility. The information provided in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated herein by reference.

In connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR or a conversion to or continuation thereof, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank Eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Loan, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for the ascertaining the LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan, or any Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR, or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans or Base Rate Loans as to which the interest rate is determined with reference to LIBOR and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan or a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is determined with a reference to LIBOR shall be suspended, and (i) in the case of LIBOR Rate Loans, the Borrower shall either (1) repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such LIBOR Rate Loan, together with accrued interest

Thereafter, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligations of the Lenders to make LIBOR Rate Loans and the right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan or continue any Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only Base Rate Loans, (ii) the Base Rate shall cease to be determined by reference to LIBOR and (iii) if any of the Lenders may not lawfully continue to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto, the applicable Loan shall immediately be converted to a Base Rate Loan as to which the interest rate is not determined by reference to LIBOR for the remainder of such Interest Period.
Laws Affecting LIBOR Rate Availability
SECTION 4.9 . The Borrower hereby indemnifies each of the Lenders against any loss or expense (including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain a LIBOR Rate Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained) which may arise or be attributable to each Lender's obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or maintain any Loan (a) as a consequence of any failure by the Borrower to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in connection with a LIBOR Rate Loan, (b) due to any failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert on a date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation or (c) due to any payment, prepayment or conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor. The amount of such loss or expense shall be determined, in the applicable Lender's sole discretion, based upon the assumption that such Lender funded its Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the LIBOR Rate Loans in the London interbank market and using any reasonable attribution or averaging methods which such Lender deems appropriate and practical. A certificate of such Lender setting forth the basis for determining such amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be forwarded to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent and shall be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error.

APOGEE REPORTS IMPROVED FY2013 THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (
December 18, 2012
)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (Nasdaq:APOG) today announced fiscal
2013
third
-quarter results. Apogee provides distinctive value-added glass solutions for the architectural and picture framing industries.
FY13 THIRD QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
Commentary
We delivered a better than expected third quarter as our architectural segment successfully executed a more favorable mix of complex work, said Joseph F. Puishys, Apogee chief executive officer. I am pleased that in down markets, Apogee grew revenues 9 percent and operating income 59 percent in the quarter.
All our architectural businesses grew operating income in the quarter, contributing to year-over-year segment operating margin improvement of 310 basis points, he said. We also maintained our architectural segment backlog compared to the second quarter, while growing segment revenues 11 percent.
In the large-scale optical segment picture framing business, revenues and earnings are up year to date, even though third-quarter results were down compared to a strong prior-year period due to the timing of customer promotions, Puishys said.

OUTLOOK
We are increasing our earnings outlook for fiscal 2013 to $0.62 to $0.67 per share from continuing operations, from $0.56 to $0.64 per share, as we benefit from improving margins resulting from better mix and good operational performance, said Puishys. Regarding top-line growth, our outlook for the full year is that revenues will grow 5 to 6 percent as we continue to outperform our end markets.
For the full year, we expect positive free cash flow, net of spending approximately $30 million of capital for investments to improve productivity, increase capacity and introduce new products, as well

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, Apogee has presented free cash flow and non-cash working capital. Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Non-cash working capital is defined as current assets, excluding cash and short-term investments, less current liabilities. Apogee believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances communications as they provide more transparency into management's performance with respect to cash and current assets and liabilities. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
The discussion above contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect Apogee management's expectations or beliefs as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements are qualified by factors that may affect the operating results of the company, including the following: operational risks within (A) the architectural segment: i) competitive, price-sensitive and changing market conditions, including unforeseen project delays and cancellations; ii) economic conditions, material cost increases and the cyclical nature of the North American and Latin American commercial construction industries; iii) product performance, reliability, execution or quality problems that could delay payments, increase costs,

impact orders or lead to litigation; and iv) the segment's ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity; and (B) the large-scale optical segment: i) markets that are impacted by consumer confidence and trends; ii) dependence on a relatively small number of customers; iii) changing market conditions, including unfavorable shift in product mix and new competition; and iv) ability to fully and efficiently utilize production capacity. Additional factors include: i) revenue and operating results that are volatile; ii) financial market disruption which could impact company, customer and supplier credit availability; iii) self-insurance risk related to a material product liability event and to health insurance programs; iv) cost of compliance with governmental regulations relating to hazardous substances; and v) foreign currency risk related to certain continuing operations. The company cautions investors that actual future results could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, and that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting the company's results of operations.

Exhibit 99.1
 
For Immediate Release
Tuesday, January 22, 2013
MINNEAPOLIS, MN (January 22, 2013)  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. today indicated that it plans to invest in the manufacturing process of its architectural glass subsidiary, Viracon. The 18-month project, which requires an investment of more than $30 million that will be spent during three fiscal years, will improve efficiencies and allow Viracon to offer the new products required to strengthen its competitive position.
Apogee is comparing the cost and benefits of making this investment in one of Viracon's two largest locations, either in Owatonna, MN or Statesboro, GA. As part of this effort, Apogee is pursuing state and local support for both locations to ensure that the investment is made in the location that best strengthens Viracon's competitive position.
Viracon glass creates the distinctive look of many buildings globally, including every major project at the World Trade Center reconstruction in New York City; Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, among the tallest buildings in the world; and the Xcel Energy Center, the University of Minnesota TCF Stadium, the Minneapolis Central Library and Best Buy headquarters in Minnesota. Viracon currently employs approximately 2,000 people in the United States, with more than 1,000 located in Owatonna. Prior to the recession, it employed approximately 3,000.

Viracon, Inc., the nation's leading single-source architectural glass fabricator, announced plans to temporarily cease operations at the smallest of its three U.S. manufacturing locations. Viracon announced today that it will close its St. George, Utah plant for approximately two years beginning in mid-April 2013. The temporary closure will better align overall capacity with the demand expected over the next two years, which can be served from Viracon's two other U.S. locations. The company also plans to upgrade the coating capabilities at the St. George plant to expand the plant's product offerings before reopening. The plant closing will impact 222 employees.
OWATONNA, MN 
"This was a very difficult but necessary decision that we had hoped to avoid," said Viracon President Kelly Schuller. "Our St. George workforce has done a great job, but the prolonged construction downturn required us to act to improve our operating efficiencies and maintain our competitive position."
Relocation opportunities are being discussed with employees on a case-by-case basis. The 210,000 square foot St. George manufacturing facility will be retained and improved by Viracon during the closure. In particular, the company plans to upgrade the coating capabilities at the St. George plant before reopening, as the market recovers, which is expected to be in approximately two years.
Production schedules, deliveries and lead times will be unaffected by the temporary closure. Production will be absorbed in one of the company's other two U.S. manufacturing facilities located in Owatonna, Minnesota and Statesboro, Georgia.
About Viracon, Inc.

full-year and
fourth

FY13 FOURTH QUARTER VS. PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD
Large-scale optical segment revenues declined 9 percent, with operating income of $4.0 million, equal to the prior year.
Commentary
I am very pleased with our fiscal 2013 results, as our earnings per share more than tripled to $0.66 on revenue growth of 6 percent in commercial construction markets that continued to be flat, said Joseph F. Puishys, Apogee chief executive officer. Our architectural backlog is up 25 percent from the

previous year end, and we generated $41 million in operating cash flow to support $35 million in capital investments for growth, productivity and product capabilities.
At the same time, we made considerable progress on our growth strategies, ranging from success in our new Texas installation and storefront markets, to new products in our businesses, he said. In addition, in our architectural glass business we made significant productivity improvements as we managed capacity and upgraded operations, and are investing in new capabilities and efficiencies in our largest facility via a new state-of-the-art coater.
During fiscal 2013, architectural segment revenues grew 6 percent, led by the installation, storefront and window businesses, and operating income improved by more than $20 million, driven by improved architectural glass pricing and product mix, good operational performance across the segment and earnings on revenue growth, said Puishys. The large-scale optical segment continued its strong performance as it introduced new glass and acrylic products, and entered new international picture framing markets.
Continuing our quarterly year-over-year improvement in fiscal 2013, fourth quarter revenues were up 7 percent and operating income more than doubled, he said. Architectural segment revenue growth was led by our installation, window and architectural glass businesses, and segment earnings benefited from improved architectural glass pricing and the strong installation revenue. I was also pleased that in spite of one less week in our fiscal quarter and the timing of the December holidays, large-scale optical segment operating income was equal to the prior-year period due to strong operational performance and mix of value-added framing products.

OUTLOOK
We expect to drive strong top- and bottom-line improvement in fiscal 2014 as we continue to implement growth and productivity initiatives, said Puishys. We anticipate revenue growth in the high single digits and earnings from continuing operations of $0.90 to $1.00 per share.
Revenue growth should largely come from domestic geographic growth and new products, and our earnings should benefit from strong architectural glass pricing and mix and improving installation margins, as both businesses execute more complex, private projects, he said. In addition, Apogee expects to gain 50 to 100 basis points of further margin improvement from our productivity initiatives.
We are experiencing stronger bidding activity for future work, and margins on new orders are improving, Puishys said. The outlook for U.S. commercial construction markets in fiscal 2014, based on Apogee's lag to McGraw-Hill forecasts for the segments we serve, is for low single-digit market growth. We again expect to outperform market growth by several percentage points.
Capital spending for fiscal 2014 is expected to be in the range of $40 to $45 million as we continue to invest for growth, productivity and product development capabilities, including for the new architectural glass coater, he said. We expect to be free cash flow positive after these investments. He added that the fiscal 2014 gross margin is anticipated to be at least 22 percent.
 
I believe that our strategies to grow through new geographies, new products and new markets will allow Apogee to reach $1 billion in revenues by the end of fiscal 2016, Puishys said. At the same time, we believe we can achieve 10 percent operating margin in this timeframe, in part through our focus on productivity and operational improvements.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
In addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this news release also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Specifically, Apogee has presented free cash flow and non-cash working capital. Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures. Non-cash working capital is defined as current assets, excluding cash and short-term investments, less current liabilities. Apogee believes that use of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances communications as they provide more transparency into management's performance with respect to cash and current assets and liabilities. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the reported operating results or cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Bonus Pool Award Agreements
On April 30, 2013, Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Bonus Pool Award Agreement with each of the executive officers listed below, which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the executive officer may receive an annual bonus award under the shareholder-approved Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2012 Executive Management Incentive Plan (the "Executive MIP"), a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 27, 2012. The agreement provides that the executive officer's right to receive an annual cash bonus award will be determined based on the attainment of certain pre-set performance metrics for the fiscal year.
The performance metric to be used to establish the bonus pool under the Executive MIP for fiscal 2014 is operating income. The performance metrics to be used for determining awards under the Executive MIP for fiscal 2014 for the executive officers listed below are net sales, earnings per share and days working capital. The table below sets forth certain information with respect to fiscal 2014 annual bonus award payout ranges as a percentage of fiscal 2014 salary for the listed executive officers based on performance at the threshold, target and maximum performance levels.
 
 
In the event an executive officer's employment is terminated during a fiscal year for any reason other than Disability or Retirement (as such terms are defined in the agreement) or death, the agreement provides that the executive officer will forfeit any and all rights under the Executive MIP and the agreement relating to such fiscal year. In accordance with the agreement, if an executive officer's employment with the Company is terminated during the fiscal year as a result of Disability, Retirement or death, the executive officer, or the executive officer's estate, as applicable, will receive a pro-rata cash payment after the end of the fiscal year to the extent that the threshold, target or maximum performance level of the performance metric is achieved.
The form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement used in connection with annual bonus awards under the Executive MIP, including the awards to executive officers listed above, is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference (the "Form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement").
 
Time-Based Restricted Stock Awards
At meetings of the Company's Compensation Committee (the "Committee") and the Company's Board of Directors held on April 30, 2013, the executive officers listed below were awarded shares of time-based restricted stock in the amounts indicated below:
 
Such restricted stock awards were made pursuant to the shareholder-approved Apogee Enterprises, Inc. 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Incentive Plan"), a copy of which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 28, 2011.

The shares of restricted stock vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary date of such grant (such three-year period is referred to herein as the "Restricted Period"). In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Restricted Period by reason of Retirement (as defined in the agreement) or involuntary termination without Cause (as defined in the agreement), the Committee has the right to cause the remaining unvested shares to be accelerated as of the date of such Retirement or involuntary termination without Cause. In the event the executive officer's employment is terminated prior to the end of the Restricted Period by reason of Disability (as defined in the agreement) or death, the shares of restricted stock will become immediately vested in full.
In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan) during the Restricted Period and the executive officer's employment is simultaneously or subsequently terminated by the Company without Cause or by the executive officer for Good Reason (as defined in the agreement) during the Restricted Period, the restrictions with respect to all of the shares held by the executive officer at the time of termination shall lapse and the shares shall immediately vest as of the date of such termination of employment.
The description in this Current Report on Form 8-K of the Form of Bonus Pool Award Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the attached copy of the agreement. The descriptions in this Current Report on Form 8-K of the Executive MIP, the Stock Incentive Plan and the Form of Restricted Stock Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copy of such plans and agreements that are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 27, 2012, Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 28, 2011 and Exhibit 10.3 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 2, 2011, respectively.
