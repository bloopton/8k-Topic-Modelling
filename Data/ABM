FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, HENRIK C. SLIPSAGER, AT 415/733-4000 (OR E-MAIL: hslipsager@abm.com) PRESS RELEASE ABM INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OF LAKESIDE BUILDING MAINTENANCE SAN FRANCISCO, July 12, 2002 -- ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM) announced today the completion by a subsidiary of the acquisition of the operations of Lakeside Building Maintenance, Inc. and an affiliated company (Lakeside). With annual revenues exceeding $160 million, Chicago-based Lakeside operated as the largest privately-owned janitorial contractor in the Midwest, with operations in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Indianapolis, Louisville, Milwaukee, Nashville and St. Louis. Lakeside's clients include AT&T Corporate Center, the John Hancock Building, the Prudential Buildings and Sears Tower in Chicago; General Motors World Headquarters at Renaissance Center in Detroit; and the State of Ohio office buildings in Columbus. Lakeside is a preferred provider of janitorial services for Equity Office Properties Trust, Hines, and Trizec Properties throughout the Midwest. Lakeside's chairman Michael Sweig, and president Nicholas Baker, will continue to manage Lakeside separate and apart from ABM's other subsidiaries operating in the Midwest. Prior to founding Lakeside with Gary Kligman in 1991, both Sweig and Baker had been employed by National Cleaning Company based in New York. Sweig was president from 1986-1989, and Baker was senior vice president in Chicago. In commenting on today's transaction, Michael Sweig said, "As the son of industry legend Morton Sweig, I've spent my entire life in the building maintenance business. For as long as I can remember, joining ABM Industries has been my ultimate career objective. This is a momentous day for me and my family." In response, ABM's president and chief executive officer, Henrik Slipsager, welcomed the management and staff of Lakeside to the ABM Family of Services, and added, "Having known Michael, Nick and Lakeside as worthy competitors for more than a decade, we're pleased and proud to have them on our team." The terms of the acquisition include a cash payment made at closing of $36.4 million, the assumption of payroll related liabilities of approximately $4.2 million,
plus contingent payments based on income for the two years commencing today and revenue retained during the third year following closing when Lakeside will be combined with ABM's other janitorial operations in the Midwest. The total purchase price, including the three contingent payments, will therefore depend on Lakeside's actual financial performance over the next three years, but is currently estimated to be $55 million. The operating results of Lakeside from July 13, 2002, will be included in the consolidated financial results of ABM Industries and were included in the earnings guidance provided during ABM's second quarter earnings announcement on June 11, 2002, and related investor conference call on June 12, 2002. Slipsager hailed the acquisition "as an important step for ABM's continued growth and prosperity in the Midwest." He added, "the acquisition of Lakeside is well within the price-earnings multiples used for acquisitions by ABM." Slipsager also noted that, "Lakeside is by far the largest acquisition in the history of our company." ABM Industries Incorporated is the largest facility services contractor listed on the New York Stock Exchange. With annualized revenues in excess of $1.9 billion and more than 60,000 employees, ABM provides air conditioning, elevator, engineering, janitorial, lighting, parking, security and related services for thousands of commercial, industrial, institutional and retail facilities in hundreds of cities across North America. In addition to Lakeside Building Maintenance, the ABM Family of Services includes ABM Janitorial, Ampco System Parking, American Commercial Security (ACSS), ABM Engineering, Amtech Elevator, Amtech Lighting and CommAir Mechanical.

     San Francisco, May 20, 2003 ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM) and its subsidiary American Building Maintenance Co.West will appeal a state court jury's decision yesterday to award $4 million in damages to a former employee because it is inconsistent with the law and the facts of the case. ABM has done nothing to warrant the gender discrimination lawsuit brought by Cheryl Forbes and is confident that it will prevail on appeal. "The evidence showed that Ms. Forbes was offered several opportunities for promotion, which she rejected," said Linda Auwers, ABM Senior Vice President & General Counsel. Ms. Auwers said that ABM will ask the Superior Court, State of Washington, County of Spokane, to set aside the jury verdict and will appeal if the court rejects that request.
     The same jury returned a verdict in ABM's favor in the second employment case considered in the trial. "ABM and its subsidiary companies treat seriously all complaints of harassment and discrimination and handle them in a manner meeting their obligations under the law," said Ms. Auwers. "ABM is pleased that the Company's position in the second case was vindicated at trial."
     ABM Industries Incorporated is the largest facility services contractor listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

ABM INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS SAN FRANCISCO, June 10, 2003 -- ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM) today reported net income for the quarter ended April 30, 2003 of $9.9 million ($0.20 per diluted share) compared to $14.0 million ($0.27 per diluted share) reported for the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Revenues for the second quarter of 2003 were $589.8 million, up 11% from $530.2 million in the second quarter of 2002. The quarter ended April 30, 2002 included a $4.3 million ($2.7 million after tax, $.05 per diluted share) gain from the receipt of an initial payment from the World Trade Center insurance claim. Included in the quarter ended April 30, 2003 were revenues and operating profits generated by ABM Lakeside Building Maintenance, which ABM acquired in July 2002, and the Company's acquisition of Horizon's self-performed janitorial operations in January 2003. Net income for the six months ended April 30, 2003 was $14.2 million ($0.29 per diluted share) compared to $22.0 million ($0.43 per diluted share) reported for the first half of fiscal 2002. Revenues for the first half of 2003 were $1,170.5 million, up 11% from $1,057.7 million in the first half of 2002. "Given the tough economic environment, our second quarter performance was solid," said Henrik C. Slipsager, ABM's President and Chief Executive Officer. "High vacancies in office buildings, the downturn in travel related to SARS and the Iraqi war,
and customers' continued tightening of budgets that reduced higher margin capital project work and extra services, all made a difference in our results today," said Slipsager. "We are pleased that the changes we implemented to improve the performance of both our Lighting and Janitorial Northeast Region, which had disappointing first quarters, are showing positive returns. Furthermore, the integration of Horizon's self-performed janitorial acquisition is on schedule and we are very excited about the recently completed acquisition of the southern California operations of Valet Parking Service," said Slipsager. "Despite this progress, we anticipate that the difficult economic environment will continue for the remainder of 2003. We expect 2003 diluted earnings per share to be approximately $0.85 per share. We are fundamentally well-positioned for internal growth when the economy improves," he added. Wednesday morning, June 11, at 6:00 a.m. (Pacific Standard Time), ABM will host a live webcast of remarks by President & Chief Executive Officer Henrik C. Slipsager and Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer George B. Sundby, who will also answer questions from a panel of financial analysts who will join Slipsager and Sundby on the conference call.

The Closing Purchase 12
Price payable by Purchaser at the Closing will be subject to future adjustment as provided in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. 3.2 Closing Purchase Price Adjustments. (a) Net Asset Adjustment; Preparation of the Preceding Month End Balance Sheet. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers (i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Business as of the end of the month ending immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Preceding Month End Balance Sheet"), and (ii) the calculation of the Adjusted Net Assets, based upon the Preceding Month End Balance Sheet and the Agreed Accounting Principles as set forth on Schedule 3.2 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule ((i) and (ii) together, the "Net Asset Adjustment Statements"). The Preceding Month End Balance Sheet shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Balance Sheet, including the Agreed Accounting Principles and, as specified thereby, U.S. GAAP to the extent applicable. The calculation of Adjusted Net Assets shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the calculation of the Target Net Assets which shall be calculated from the Balance Sheet prepared in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles. (b) Stub Period Cash Adjustment; Preparation of Cash Change Schedule. As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall also deliver to Seller a schedule (the "Cash Change Schedule"), substantially in the form set forth on Schedule 3.2(b) of Sellers Disclosure Schedule, which shall set forth the Cash Change in the Business (the absolute value of such amount, the "Cash Change Amount"). Purchaser shall prepare the Cash Change Schedule in good faith and in accordance with past practices of AES and the Business. The Net Asset Adjustment Statements and the Cash Change Schedule shall be collectively known herein as the "Adjustment Statements". The parties understand and agree that the mechanism of the Cash Change adjustment is intended to reimburse Sellers with respect to Sellers' payment of Reimbursable Liabilities and Stub Period Operational Expenses to the extent Sellers pay any such amounts during the period from the date of the Preceding Month End Balance Sheet through and including the Closing Date. If any such Reimbursable Liabilities and Stub Period Operational Expenses are not reflected as paid by Sellers on the Cash Change Schedule, Purchaser shall pay such amounts to the Sellers, if and when such liabilities are paid by Sellers following the Closing Date, pursuant to the mechanics set forth in the Interim Services Agreement, as provided in Section 3.2(f) hereof. (c) Review of Adjustment Statements. After delivery to it of the applicable Adjustment Statement(s), Sellers (and their representatives) shall be afforded the opportunity to review the work papers, schedules and other supporting papers relating to the preparation of the Adjustment Statements and to consult with Purchaser and its representatives, if necessary, regarding the methods used in the preparation thereof. Within thirty (30) days after Sellers' receipt of the applicable Adjustment Statements Sellers shall either inform the other in writing that the applicable Adjustment Statement is acceptable or object to such Adjustment Statement in writing setting forth a specific description of the objections and specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of 13
such disagreement. Sellers shall not give a notice of disagreement unless the aggregate amount in dispute exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). The failure of Sellers to deliver written objections to Purchaser within thirty (30) days after receipt of the applicable Adjustment Statement shall be deemed acceptance of such Adjustment Statement. If Sellers objects to the Adjustment Statement and if Purchaser does not agree with such objections (it being agreed that the failure of Purchaser to deliver written notice to Sellers of Purchaser's disagreement with Sellers objections within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such objections shall be deemed acceptance by Purchaser failing to deliver notice), or such objections are not resolved on a mutually agreeable basis within thirty (30) days after the Purchaser's receipt of such objections, any disagreement between the parties regarding the same shall be resolved by Deloitte & Touche LLP or if Deloitte & Touche LLP is not available to serve, then an alternative unaffiliated accounting firm to be selected by the parties (the "Neutral Accountant"). The decision of the Neutral Accountant shall be (i) made within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute based solely on the presentations by Purchaser and Sellers, (ii) in accordance with this Agreement and (iii) final and binding upon the parties. Upon the agreement of the parties or the decision of the Neutral Accountant or Seller's failure to deliver a written objection to Purchaser within the thirty (30) day period after receipt of the applicable Adjustment Statement provided above, the Preceding Month End Balance Sheet (as adjusted, if necessary) shall be deemed the Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet (the "Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet") and the determination of the Adjusted Net Assets shall be deemed final or the Cash Change Schedule and the determination of the Cash Change shall be deemed final, as the case may be. Each party shall bear the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and shall share equally the fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral Accountant. (d) Adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price; Payment. Upon final determination in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(c) of (A) the Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet and the Adjusted Net Assets and (B) the Cash Change Amount, a net payment, reflecting an adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price, shall be made by one party to the other according to the following rules: (i) if the Adjusted Net Assets exceed the Target Net Assets, the amount of such excess shall be payable by Purchaser to Sellers, or (ii) if the Adjusted Net Assets are less than the Target Net Assets, the amount of any deficiency shall be payable by Sellers to Purchaser; and (iii) if the Cash Change is a net cash outflow (as reflected on the Cash Change Schedule), the Cash Change Amount shall be payable by Purchaser to Sellers, or (iv) if the Cash Change is a net cash inflow (as reflected on the Cash Change Schedule), the Cash Change Amount shall be payable by Sellers to Purchaser. Any adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price required under this Section 3.2(d) in 14
respect of such net payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within ten (10) days after the date that the final determination with respect to both of (A) the Adjusted Net Assets and (B) Cash Change Amount in accordance with Section 3.2(c), together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment calculated at the prime rate in effect on the Closing Date as reported in the Wall Street Journal. (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Closing occurs on the last Business day of a month, there shall be no adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price made in respect of the Cash Change, and all references to the Cash Change, the Cash Change Amount, the Stub Period Operational Expenses and the Cash Change Schedule (other than in this Section 3.2(e)) shall not apply. In such event, the only adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be based upon the difference between the Target Net Assets and the Adjusted Net Assets. (f) Reimbursement for Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet liabilities and Stub Period Operational Expenses. To the extent Sellers pay, following the Closing Date, any amounts in respect of (i) Reimbursable Liabilities or (ii) Stub Period Operational Expenses, Purchaser shall, at Sellers' request, promptly reimburse Sellers with respect thereto in accordance with the mechanics agreed upon in the Interim Services Agreement; provided that Purchaser shall not be obligated to reimburse Sellers with respect to such payments prior to the final determination of the Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet and the Cash Change Schedule. Following the final determination of the Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet and the Cash Change Schedule, Purchaser may, within a period of 15 days thereafter (with respect to requests for reimbursement made prior to such final determination) or 15 days following Sellers' request for reimbursement (with respect to requests for reimbursement made by Sellers to Purchaser after the final determination of the Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet and the Cash Change Schedule) object to such reimbursement in writing to Sellers setting forth a specific description of the objections and specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the disagreement. The failure of Purchaser to deliver a written objection to Sellers within the applicable 15 day period shall be deemed agreement by Purchaser with respect to such amount requested, and Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Sellers with respect thereto. If Purchaser objects within the applicable 15 day period and the disagreement cannot be resolved by mutual agreement within 15 additional days following Sellers' receipt of such objection, the disagreement shall be resolved by a Neutral Accountant. The decision of the Neutral Accountant with respect to any amount requested by Sellers for reimbursement in accordance with the foregoing provisions shall be (i) made within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute based solely on the presentations by Purchaser and Sellers, (ii) in accordance with this Agreement and (iii) final and binding upon the parties. 3.3 Modernization Contracts (a) In the event that Purchaser in the course of completing all Assumed Contracts relating to modernization projects (the "Modernization Contracts") incurs costs with respect to such Modernization Contracts, which together with the costs 15
incurred by the Business prior to the Closing Date with respect to such Modernization Contracts (such costs together, the "Incurred Costs"), are in excess of the total sales prices of all such Modernization Contracts in the aggregate (such excess, the "Modernization Losses"), Purchaser shall be permitted to recover the amount of such Modernization Losses from Sellers; provided that for purposes of determining costs incurred for any particular Modernization Contract the Agreed Accounting Principles shall govern and an overhead allocation calculated in accordance with the Agreed Accounting Principles shall be included. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section 9.5, in no event will Purchaser be able to collect any Modernization Losses unless and until the total amount of Modernization Losses exceeds $1,000,000 (but only in the amount of such excess). Schedule 3.3(a) of Sellers Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the AES's portfolio of Modernization Contracts as of May, 31 2003, and Sellers shall update such schedule as of the Closing for new Modernization Contracts obtained between May 31, 2003 and the Closing Date. (b) Following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall inform Seller on a consistent quarterly basis as to (i) whether or not Modernization Losses then exist and (ii) whether any particular Modernization Contract that is a Material Contract has either (a) resulted in incurred costs in respect of such contract in excess of the sales price under such contract or (b) in Purchaser's reasonable judgment, based on past experience and generally accepted industry practices, is likely to begin resulting in costs that, together with previously incurred costs in respect of such contract, will exceed the sales price under such contract. (c) As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than sixty (60) days after the completion of all Modernization Contracts included on Schedule 3.3(a) of Sellers Disclosure Schedule (as updated), Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a statement (the "Modernization Losses Statement") setting forth the Modernization Losses and a table including the sales price and incurred costs for each such Modernization Contract listed on Schedule 3.3(a) of Sellers Disclosure Schedule. Sellers shall have a right to inspect Purchaser's records with respect to incurred costs and payments received if recovery for any Modernization Losses applies in accordance with Section 3.3(a). (d) After delivery to Sellers of the Modernization Losses Statement, Sellers (and their representatives) shall be afforded the opportunity to review the work papers, schedules and other supporting papers relating to the Modernization Losses Statement delivered by the Purchaser and to consult with the Purchaser and its representatives, if necessary, regarding the methods used in the preparation thereof. Within thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of the Modernization Losses Statement, Sellers shall either inform the Purchaser in writing that the Modernization Losses Statement is acceptable or object to the Modernization Losses Statement in writing setting forth a specific description of the objections and specifying in reasonable detail the nature and extent of such disagreement. Such disagreement and final resolution of the amount of Modernization Losses shall be determined consistent with the procedures described in Section 3.2(c) above. 16
(e) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to perform and complete the Modernization Contracts in accordance with the terms and conditions of such contracts, generally accepted industry practices and otherwise in good faith and consistent with the past practices of the Business and Purchaser with respect to Modernization Contracts.

(d) If (i) Purchaser shall desire to dispose of any Books and Records transferred to Purchaser hereunder or (ii) Seller shall desire to dispose of the Excluded Records (other than the Excluded Records pertaining to personnel records of former employees of the Business) or, to the extent Purchaser has requested access pursuant to Section 7.2(c), other limited Books and Records retained by Sellers primarily related to the Business, within five (5) years following the Closing Date, such party shall, prior to such disposition, give the other party a reasonable opportunity at the other party's expense, to segregate and remove such Books and Records as the other party may select. 7.3 Expenses Except to the extent specifically provided herein, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses. 7.4 Further Assurances Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto will use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and make effective the sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement. From time to time after the date hereof, without further consideration, Sellers will, at their own expense, execute and deliver such documents to Purchaser as Purchaser may reasonably request in order more effectively to vest in Purchaser good title to the Purchased Assets. From time to time after the date hereof, Purchaser will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such documents to Sellers as Sellers may reasonably request in order to more effectively consummate the sale of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement. 7.5 Public Statements The parties shall consult with each other prior to issuing any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such public announcement, statement or other disclosure prior to such consultation; provided that nothing herein shall 29
require any approval by the other party and the length of any such consultation shall be in the sole discretion of the party issuing such public announcement. 7.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts (a) The Purchaser and Sellers shall act in good faith and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, the Purchaser and Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain all consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, permits, authorizations, registrations, qualifications or other permissions or actions by, and give all necessary notices to, and make all filings with and applications and submissions to, any Governmental Authority or Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as reasonably practicable; (ii) provide all relevant information as may be necessary or reasonably requested in connection with any of the foregoing; and (iii) avoid the entry of, or have vacated or terminated, any injunction, decree, order, or judgment that would restrain, prevent, or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to defending through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any person so as to enable the consummation of such transactions to occur as expeditiously as possible, including, with respect to the Purchaser, the taking by the Purchaser of all such actions, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing. (b) The Purchaser and Sellers shall keep each other reasonably informed as to the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications received by any of them or by any of their respective Affiliates, from any Person or any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. (c) Notwithstanding the above or any other provision of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not be required to take any action that would reasonably be expected to impair the benefits to Purchaser of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in a materially adverse manner. 7.7 Tax Matters (a) Purchaser and Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, promptly upon request, any information and assistance relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets as may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, the preparation for any audit or other examination by any Governmental Authority, the mailing or filing of any notice and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return or any other matter related to Taxes with respect to the Business and the Purchased Assets. 30
Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding related to Taxes involving the Business or the Purchased Assets whether prior to or after the Closing. Purchaser further agrees to (i) retain within its possession any other information regarding Taxes relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing (the "Tax Information") until the date that is six years after the Closing Date, (ii) maintain the Tax Information in such manner so as to enable Sellers to have prompt and complete access thereto; provided, however, that Sellers must bear all costs incurred in accessing such Tax Information, and (iii) not destroy any Tax Information without first offering such information to Sellers. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns regarding any Transfer Taxes that become payable in connection with the purchase of the Purchased Assets contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Transfer Taxes" shall mean all transfer, documenting, stamp or registration Taxes applicable to the purchase of the Purchased Assets contemplated hereby. All such Transfer Taxes shall be paid when due one-half (1/2) by Sellers and one-half (1/2) by Purchaser, and Sellers shall, at their own expense, file, to the extent required by Applicable Law, all necessary Tax Returns with respect to all such Transfer Taxes, and, if required by Applicable Law, Purchaser shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns; provided, however, that prior to filing any Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes Sellers shall provide to Purchaser for its review and comment a copy of any such Tax Return at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date such Tax Return is filed or required to be filed and Sellers shall amend such Tax Return as reasonably requested by Purchaser (provided Purchaser's comments are received at least five (5) days prior to the due date, without extensions, for filing the relevant Tax Return). If governing law does not allow Sellers, but requires Purchaser, to file a Tax Return with respect to a Transfer Tax for which Sellers and Purchaser are liable under this Agreement, Purchaser shall prepare such Tax Return, present such Tax Return to Sellers for review and comment at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date such Tax Return is filed or required to be filed and Purchaser shall amend such Tax Return as reasonably requested by Sellers (provided Sellers comments are received at least five (5) days prior to the due date, without extensions, for filing the relevant Tax Return). Sellers shall join in the execution of any such Tax Returns if required by Applicable Law. (c) Purchaser shall prepare a schedule that allocates the Closing Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "Allocation Schedule") within 60 days of this Agreement but in no event less than 30 days prior to the Closing and submit it to Sellers. Sellers may dispute the Allocation Schedule; provided, however, that if Sellers fail to notify Purchaser in writing of the disputed amount, and the basis of such dispute, within ten (10) days of receipt of the Allocation Schedule, the Allocation Schedule shall be incorporated herein as if part of this Agreement. If Sellers timely notify Purchaser of any such dispute, Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts in reaching a mutually satisfactory agreement regarding the Allocation Schedule. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement regarding 31
the Allocation Schedule, then Sellers and Purchaser shall submit in writing any matters in dispute to the Neutral Accountant, which Neutral Accountant will resolve the dispute in a fair and equitable manner within thirty (30) days after Purchaser and Sellers have presented their arguments to the Neutral Accountant, which decision shall be final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Sellers. Purchaser and Sellers each agree to file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and all Tax Returns in accordance with such agreed allocation unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. Each of Purchaser and Sellers shall report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the allocation determined pursuant to this Section 7.7(e). Each of Purchaser and Sellers agree to provide the other promptly with any other information required to complete Form 8594. Each of Purchaser and Sellers shall notify and provide the other with reasonable assistance in the event of an examination, audit or other proceeding regarding the agreed upon allocation of the Closing Purchase Price. (d) Sellers agree that Purchaser is not assuming liability for Other Taxes but only agreeing to reimburse Sellers at Sellers request with respect to Sellers' payment following the Closing of any Other Taxes reflected on the Preceding Month End Balance Sheet or incurred by the Business in the ordinary course of business between the date of the Preceding Month End Balance Sheet and the Closing Date; it being understood by the parties that the obligation to file returns with respect to and pay, any such Taxes shall be retained by Seller in accordance with the provisions of 2.4(e). 7.8 Employees (a) As of the Closing, Purchaser will negotiate in good faith for a collective bargaining agreement with the International Union of Elevator Constructors covering the Transferred Employees and shall execute any documents needed to effectuate such agreement. (b) (i) Promptly following the date hereof, Purchaser shall offer, or cause to be offered, employment to all Employees effective as of the Closing Date. For a period of at least one year following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause each such Employee who accepts and commences employment with Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser as of the Closing (the "Transferred Employees"), to the extent that such Transferred Employee remains employed during such period, to be provided with salary, wages, and employee benefit arrangements that shall be at least substantially equivalent, on an aggregate basis, to the compensation and benefits provided by Purchaser to its similarly situated employees; provided that the foregoing provision shall not apply to any Transferred Employees party to Elevator Executive Agreements, Elevator Personnel Agreements or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Purchaser shall cause the Transferred Employees to be given credit for all service with Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers prior to the Closing for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) under any employee benefit plans or arrangements of Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser in which such Transferred Employees participate after the Closing ("Purchaser Plans"), to the same extent that such service was recognized by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers immediately prior to the Closing under any comparable programs or arrangements of Sellers or any Affiliate of Seller (except to the extent that such 32
crediting would result in duplication of benefits). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all vacation, sickness, holiday and personal days accrued by the Transferred Employees prior to the Closing shall be honored by Purchaser to the extent that accruals for such liabilities are fully and properly reflected on the Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet or to the extent such liabilities are properly accrued in accordance with past practice between the date of the Final Preceding Month End Balance Sheet and the Closing Date. To the extent commercially reasonable, all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred Employees shall be waived by Purchaser. To the extent commercially reasonable, Transferred Employees shall also be given credit for any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of Purchaser Plan year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing, they participate in any Purchaser Plan during such plan year for which deductibles or co-payments are required and to the extent permitted by the relevant Purchaser Plan. (ii) With respect to any employee of any Seller whose work or function is related primarily to the operation of the Business, and who is, as of the Closing Date, on authorized leave of absence (including, but not limited to, employees on disability), Purchaser shall offer employment to any such employee in the event such employee returns to active employment within six months of the Closing Date and such employee shall then be deemed to be a Transferred Employee. Any represented employee shall be reemployed in accordance with the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. (c) Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify Sellers and defend and hold Sellers harmless against, any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses, obligations and liabilities (including costs of collection, attorney's fees and other costs of defense) incurred by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers arising from or relating to (i) the termination of employment (A) of any Employee following the date of this Agreement, which termination is at the request of Purchaser or one of its Affiliates, or (B) by Purchaser of any Transferred Employee as of or after the Closing Date and (ii) the hiring, employment or discharge of any Transferred Employee. Purchaser shall assume and be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify Sellers and defend and hold Sellers harmless against, any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses, obligations and liabilities (including costs of collection, attorney's fees and other costs of defense) incurred by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers in connection with any suit or claim or violation brought against Sellers under the WARN Act or any similar state, local or foreign law which arise, in whole or in part, from actions taken by Purchaser following the Closing. Sellers shall assume and be solely responsible for and shall indemnify Purchaser, and hold Purchaser harmless against any and all claims, attorneys fees and other costs of defense incurred by Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser arising from or related to the hiring, employment, benefit plan participation, or discharge of any employee of any Seller who is not a Transferred Employee. (d) Effective as of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees shall no longer actively participate in Sellers' 401(k) plans (the "Sellers Savings Plans"). Purchaser shall designate a tax-qualified defined contribution plan of Purchaser or one of 33
its Affiliates (such plan(s), the "Purchaser's Savings Plan") that either (i) currently provides for the receipt from Transferred Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is defined under Section 402 of the Code) or (ii) shall be amended as soon as practicable following the Closing Date to provide for the receipt from the Transferred Employees of eligible rollover distributions. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall provide Seller with such documents and other information as Seller shall reasonably request to assure itself that Purchaser's Savings Plan provides for the receipt of eligible rollover distributions and (y) Seller shall provide Purchaser with such documents and other information as Purchaser shall reasonably request to assure itself that the accounts of the Transferred Employees would be eligible rollover distributions. Each Transferred Employee who is a participant in Sellers Savings Plans shall be given the opportunity to receive a distribution of his or her account balance and shall be given the opportunity to elect to "roll over" such account balance to Purchaser's Savings Plan, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of such plan(s) and Applicable Law. Sellers shall provide Purchaser with copies of such personnel and other records of Sellers pertaining to the Transferred Employees and such records of any agent or representative of Sellers pertaining to the Transferred Employees and such records of any agent or representative of Sellers, in each case pertaining to Sellers Savings Plans and as Purchaser may reasonably request in order to administer and manage the accounts and assets rolled over to Purchaser's Savings Plan. (e) With respect to the National Elevator Industries Pension Fund (the "NEI Multiemployer Plan"), after the Closing, if the amount of potential withdrawal liability of Sellers with respect to the NEI Plan as of the Closing Date is greater than zero: (i) Purchaser will be obligated to make contributions to the NEI Multiemployer Plan with respect to those Transferred Employees for whom Sellers had an obligation to contribute to the NEI Multiemployer Plan prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be obligated to make such contributions in accordance with any collective bargaining agreement relating thereto and shall contribute to the NEI Multiemployer Plan with respect to such operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which Sellers had an obligation to contribute to such plan with respect to employees employed by Sellers in the Business prior to the Closing Date. (ii) Purchaser hereby represents to Sellers that, for purposes of complying with Section 4204 of ERISA, no surety bond will be required of Purchaser in order for Sellers to be exempt from any partial withdrawal liability. Purchaser represents that it is exempt from the surety bond requirement in accordance with PBGC Regulation Section 4204.13. In addition, the transaction contemplated herein may be an exempt de minimis transaction within the meaning of PBGC Regulation Section 4204.12. If, within the five-year period following the Closing Date, Purchaser no longer qualifies for any relevant exemption under Section 4204 of ERISA, it will post a surety bond or take such other action reasonably acceptable to Sellers to prevent the sale of the Business from being deemed a partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan. 34
(iii) If Purchaser withdraws from the Multiemployer Plan in a complete withdrawal or a partial withdrawal with respect to the Transferred Employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement within the period referred to in the preceding subsection (ii), Purchaser will be primarily liable and Sellers agree to be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability Sellers would have had at the Closing Date to such Multiemployer Plan, but for the application of section 4204 of ERISA, if the withdrawal liability of Purchaser with respect to such Multiemployer Plan is not paid. Purchaser shall indemnify Sellers for any liability it incurs pursuant to this Section 7.8(e)(iii). (iv) Purchaser agrees that any action on its part that causes withdrawal liability (either partial or complete) during the period referred to in subsection (ii) hereof shall be for valid business reasons only. In the event of a subsequent sale of the assets of the Business by Purchaser during such period, Purchaser agrees to comply with the provisions of section 4204(a)(1) of ERISA. (v) If all, or substantially all, of Sellers' assets are distributed, or if Sellers are liquidated before the end of the first five plan years beginning after Closing, then, except as may otherwise be required by law, Sellers shall provide a bond, an amount in escrow or such other security as may be permitted under section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA or regulations thereunder, equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability Sellers would have had but for the application of section 4204 of ERISA, which bond, amount in escrow or other security may be applied toward the satisfaction of Sellers' secondary liability described in subsection (iii) hereof. (vi) Purchaser agrees to provide Sellers with reasonable advance notice of any action or event which could result in the imposition of withdrawal liability contemplated by this Section 7.8(e), and in any event Purchaser shall immediately furnish Sellers with a copy of any notice of withdrawal liability it may receive with respect to the Multiemployer Plan, together with all the pertinent details. In the event that any such withdrawal liability shall be assessed against Purchaser, Purchaser further agrees to provide Sellers with reasonable advance notice of any intention on the part of Purchaser not to make full payment of any withdrawal liability when the same shall become due. (vii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Purchaser shall have no obligation to indemnify Sellers for any losses or expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) which Sellers may incur as a result of a determination that the requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA are not met (provided that such determination does not result from Purchaser's failure to comply with its obligations hereunder); (ii) Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for any losses or expense (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) which Purchaser may incur as a result of a determination that the requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA are not met (provided that such determination does not result from Purchaser's failure to comply with its obligations hereunder); and (iii) Purchaser shall indemnify Sellers for any losses or expense (including without limitation, any assessed withdrawal liability, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) which Sellers may incur as a result of a 35
determination that the requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA are not met (provided that such determination results from Purchaser's failure to comply with its obligations hereunder). 7.9 Risk of Loss (a) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, risk of loss or damage to the Purchased Assets shall be borne by Sellers. (b) If, before the Closing Date, all or any portion of the Purchased Assets are (i) taken by eminent domain, (ii) the subject of a pending or (to Sellers' Knowledge) contemplated taking which has not been consummated, or (iii) damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, Sellers shall notify Purchaser promptly in writing of such fact. (c) If such taking, damage or destruction would not have a Material Adverse Effect, Purchaser and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to settle the loss resulting from such taking, damage or destruction (including, without limitation, by making a fair and equitable adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price) and, upon such settlement, consummate the transaction contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. If no such settlement is reached within sixty (60) days after Sellers have notified Purchaser of such taking, damage or destruction, then, upon the written request of either Purchaser or Sellers, the Neutral Accountant shall resolve any disagreement. The Neutral Accountant shall determine the loss resulting from such taking, damage or destruction as promptly as practicable (but in any event within sixty (60) days following the date on which such dispute is referred to the Neutral Accountant), based solely on written submissions made to the Neutral Accountant by Purchaser and Sellers to the Neutral Accountant within fifteen (15) days following the Neutral Accountant's selection and such other information or submissions as may be requested by the Neutral Accountant thereafter. Purchaser on the one hand and Sellers on the other shall share equally the fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant. The determination of the Neutral Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on Purchaser and Sellers, and the Neutral Accountant's determination of the loss resulting from such taking, damage or destruction shall then be deducted from the Closing Purchase Price. 7.10 Transfers Not Effected as of Closing (a) Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the conveyance, assignment or transfer of any Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease that by its terms or by operation of law cannot be freely conveyed, assigned, transferred or assumed. To the extent the parties hereto have been unable to obtain any Person's consent or approval required for the transfer of any Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease and to the extent not otherwise prohibited by the terms of any Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease, Sellers shall continue to be bound by the terms of such applicable Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease and Purchaser shall pay, perform and discharge fully all of the obligations of Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates thereunder from and after the Closing; provided however that such applicable Assumed Contract shall be an Assumed 36
Contract for the purposes of Assumed Liabilities pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof. Sellers shall, without consideration therefore, pay, assign and remit to Purchaser promptly all monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of such performance. Subject to Section 7.10(b), if Purchaser determines to seek consent to assign any Assumed Contract or Assumed Lease, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Purchaser in obtaining such consent (provided that neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall be required to pay any consideration to the third party from whom such consent is sought) and the parties hereto shall continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such sought and unobtained consents or approvals at the earliest practicable date. If and when any such consents or approvals shall be obtained, Sellers shall promptly assign their rights and obligations thereunder to Purchaser without payment of consideration and Purchaser shall, without the payment of any consideration therefore, assume such rights and obligations, deemed to be effective as of the Closing Date; provided that if Purchaser subcontracts performance of any Assumed Contract in accordance with its terms Purchaser shall be obligated to pay, perform and discharge all of the obligations of the Sellers thereunder effective as of the Closing Date. The parties shall execute such good and sufficient instruments as may be necessary to evidence such assignment and assumption. (b) Following the date hereof, Purchaser shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate with Sellers with respect to obtaining any consent to assignment required under Assumed Contracts. Within a reasonable period of time following the date hereof, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a schedule setting forth a list of Material Maintenance Contacts requiring consent to assignment (the "Required Consents"). At or immediately prior to Closing, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser (i) an updated Schedule 5.7 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule which shall include new maintenance contracts of the Business entered into after the date hereof with monthly revenue in excess of seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) (it being agreed that (A) Schedule 5.7 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule, as updated, shall have deleted contract-for-contract a corresponding number of contracts with the lowest monthly revenue on such Schedule 5.7 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule prior to such update and (B) that the contents of such updated schedule shall be deemed to meet the description set forth in Section 5.7(a)(i)), (ii) a list of Required Consents with respect to such updated Schedule 5.7 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule and (iii) the status with respect to obtaining such Required Consents described in clause (ii) hereof. The parties agree that all references to Required Consents set forth in Section 7.10(c) shall be only in respect of the Required Consents on the updated Schedule 5.7 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule delivered in accordance with the provisions hereof. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.10(a), Sellers shall have ninety (90) calendar days from the Closing Date (the "Consent Period") in which to obtain any Required Consent requested by Purchaser (the "Requested Required Consents"); provided that Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Sellers in obtaining such Requested Required Consents; provided further that neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall be obligated hereunder to pay any consideration to the third party for any such Requested Required Consent. If any such Requested Required Consents are obtained and delivered to Purchaser within the Consent Period and 37
the Closing has occurred, the assignment of the Material Maintenance Contracts to which such consents relate shall be made promptly and deemed to be effective, and Purchaser shall be deemed to have assumed the obligations and liabilities thereunder, as of the Closing Date. If any such Requested Required Consents are not obtained within the Consent Period, Purchaser shall be entitled to recover from Sellers an amount equal to twelve (12) months' maintenance and service revenues attributable to such contract (calculated by annualizing the maintenance and service revenue attributable to such contract for the month of June 2003); provided that Purchaser shall not be entitled to collect any amount in respect of any Material Maintenance Contract for which consent is not obtained within the Consent Period if (i) by the terms of any such contract, such contract is expired or expires in accordance with its terms within the Consent Period, as set forth on Schedule 5.7 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule (such applicable contracts are marked with an asterisk (*) thereon), (ii) the customer under any such Material Maintenance Contract for whom a Requested Required Consent applies shall have continued to receive and pay for elevator maintenance services under the terms of such contract for the monthly period following the end of the Consent Period and such customer shall not have provided written notification of termination of such Material Maintenance Contract during the Consent Period, (iii) Purchaser is able to subcontract the performance of the applicable Material Maintenance Contract from Sellers in accordance with its terms or (iv) after the Consent Period, Purchaser informs Sellers that Sellers should continue to use all reasonable efforts to obtain the Requested Required Consent; provided that, subject to the provisions of Section 9.5 hereof, Seller shall only be required to pay Purchaser in respect of qualifying unobtained Requested Required Consents hereunder after the aggregate of all lost monthly maintenance and service revenue with respect to such Material Maintenance Contracts for which consents were not obtained exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) (and then only in the amount of such excess). (d) With respect to any Performance Bonds issued by ABM in respect of the Business that are not otherwise assignable without consent to Purchaser hereunder as of the Closing, Purchaser covenants to promptly replace any such Performance Bonds with equivalent performance and surety bonds of Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof in accordance with the terms of any applicable Assumed Contracts and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a release of ABM with respect thereto. 7.11 Agreement Not to Compete (a) Sellers understand that Purchaser shall be entitled to protect and preserve the going concern value of the Business to the extent permitted by law and that Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of this Section 7.11 and, therefore, Sellers agree that for a period of five (5) years following the Effective Time such Person will not, directly or indirectly own, manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of or be related or otherwise affiliated in any manner with, any business similar to that engaged in by the Business (a "Buyer Competitive Business"); provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.11 shall prohibit Sellers, or their Affiliates, from owning up to 5% of the outstanding voting securities of any publicly traded entity; provided, further, that nothing in this Section 7.11 38
shall prohibit Sellers, or their Affiliates, from acquiring a Buyer Competitive Business as part of an acquisition (by joint venture, merger or other) of the assets of, or the majority of voting interest in, another Person (a "Target Business") if the worldwide sales from the Buyer Competitive Business are not in excess of 30% of the worldwide sales of the Target Business in the most recent fiscal year of the Target Business preceding such acquisition. In the event the Sellers, or their Affiliates, acquire a Buyer Competitive Business pursuant to the second proviso in the preceding sentence, Sellers shall divest such Buyer Competitive Business by way of auction or other competitive bidding process, negotiation, sale or such other manner or divestiture as the Sellers shall deem appropriate and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do so within a period of six (6) months from the date of such acquisition. For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Sellers and their Affiliates shall not solicit any Employees of the Business or otherwise affirmatively and intentionally induce any Employee of the Business to leave such employ for purposes of accepting a position with Sellers; provided that the preceding non-solicitation obligation of Sellers and their Affiliates shall not apply to administrative or clerical Employees of the Business. Sellers and Purchaser intend that the covenants contained in this Section be construed as a series of separate covenants and Sellers acknowledge that the limitations as to time, geographic area and scope of activity set forth above are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and the Business to be acquired by Purchaser under this Agreement. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is understood by the parties hereto and agreed that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to Section 9.2 and other remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the covenants contained in Section 7.11(a), and each party hereto agrees that the other party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including the remedy of specific performance, with respect to any breach or attempted breach of such covenants. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court refuses to enforce any of the separate covenants contained in Section 7.11(a), the unenforceable covenant will be considered eliminated from this Section 7.11 for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced. (c) Nothing contained herein to the contrary shall prohibit ABM (or any of its Affiliates) from being acquired, through sale, merger or related transaction, by any entity which qualifies as, owns or operates or is affiliated with, a Buyer Competitive Business. Purchaser agrees that neither any such acquiror nor any of its Affiliates (including ABM after such acquisition) will be bound by the terms of Section 7.11(a). 7.12 No Other Bids Sellers agree that they shall not, and shall not permit any of their Affiliates, or any officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives of any of the foregoing to, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate (including by way of furnishing any non-public information concerning the Business or AES) inquiries or proposals, or participate in any discussions or negotiations or enter into any agreement with any Person with respect to such inquiries or proposals, concerning an acquisition of all or any substantial portion of AES, the Business or the Purchased Assets, except for the 39
transactions with Purchaser contemplated by this Agreement, and Sellers shall immediately advise Purchaser of any such inquiry or proposal, including the terms thereof and the identity of the Person making such inquiry or proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.12, ABM shall in no way by the terms of this Section 7.12 be restricted from soliciting or initiating inquiries or proposals, participating in any discussions or negotiations or entering into any agreement, with respect to a sale, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, liquidation or other business combination involving ABM, or the sale of all or substantially all the assets thereof (an "ABM Transaction"), and ABM shall have no obligations with respect to the notification of Purchaser with respect to any inquiry or proposal regarding an ABM Transaction. 7.13 Federal Government Contracts. (a) With respect to the Federal Government Contracts listed on Schedule 7.13 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, promptly following the date hereof Purchaser shall provide in good faith proposed amendments to the Federal Government Contracts that are reasonably required to allow the proper assignment or transfer of such Federal Government Contracts to Purchaser pursuant to Applicable Law. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such amendments or novations to any Federal Government Contracts and Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller in obtaining any such amendments or novations. (b) Until such time as amendments and novations with respect to each Federal Government Contract have been executed by all parties and delivered, Sellers shall continue to perform under the terms of each Federal Government Contract for Sellers' account. Sellers shall perform under each Federal Government Contract using labor temporarily hired from the Purchaser. Purchaser shall be compensated for such temporary use of its employees at the applicable direct labor cost, plus the applicable indirect labor rate, plus material costs. Sellers shall pay Purchaser for such costs no later than thirty days following its receipt of Purchaser's invoice. (c) Following the execution and delivery of satisfactory amendments and novations to each Federal Government Contract, title to such amended and novated Federal Government Contracts shall be deemed to be transferred to Purchaser. Thereafter, Purchaser shall undertake performance of each Federal Government Contract so amended and novated for its own account, and Purchaser shall be entitled to any profit under such Federal Government Contracts. (d) In the event that any Federal Government Contract is not amended or novated such as to allow the proper assignment or transfer of such Federal Government Contracts to Purchaser pursuant to Applicable Law, Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate and use their collective efforts to sell any such Federal Government Contract to a third-party elevator modernization and maintenance company. The proceeds from the sale of any such Federal Government Contract shall belong exclusively to the Purchaser. 40
7.14 Trademark License.

(b) With respect to any guarantees by ABM of Assumed Leases, Purchaser shall promptly following Closing replace such guarantees with suitable equivalent guarantees, if required, of Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof pursuant to such Assumed Leases and use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain a release of ABM with respect to all such guarantees.

ARTICLE IX SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION 9.1 Survival All representations and warranties made by the parties hereto pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing (a) in the case of the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.2 relating to authority, without limitation and (b) in the case of any other representation and warranty in this Agreement for a period of eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date. All representations and warranties, except Section 5.2, shall terminate and be of no further force or effect following the eighteen month anniversary of the Closing Date, and no claims shall thereafter be brought thereunder. The covenants and agreements of the parties hereto contained herein shall survive in accordance with their respective terms. 9.2 Indemnification (a) Sellers will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser from and against any and all claims, demands or suits, losses, liabilities, damages, obligations, payments, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses of any and all actions, suits, proceedings, assessments, judgments, settlements and compromises relating thereto and reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable disbursements in connection therewith) (collectively, "Indemnifiable Losses"), asserted against or suffered by Purchaser and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Group") relating to, resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of Sellers contained in this Agreement, (ii) any breach by Sellers of any covenant in this Agreement or any failure of Sellers to perform any of its obligations contained in this Agreement, (iii) the Excluded Liabilities or (iv) claims under Sections 3.3 or 7.10(c); provided, however, that, subject to provisions of Section 9.5, Sellers shall be required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless under clause (i) of this Section 9.2(a) with respect to Indemnifiable Losses incurred by the Purchaser Group only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Indemnifiable Losses exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000) (and then only in the amount of such excess), and provided further, that the aggregate liability of Sellers under clause (i) this Section 9.2(a) shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Closing Purchase Price. For purposes of this Article IX, in determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article V of this Agreement or the amount of any Indemnifiable Losses resulting from any such breach, (i) such representation and warranties (other than Section 5.4(a)) shall be read without regard to any "Material Adverse Effect" qualifier contained therein; provided that in the first sentence of Section 5.8 the phrase "which, if adversely determined, would have a Material Adverse Effect" shall be replaced with the phrase "except as set forth in Schedule 2.4(b) of Sellers Disclosure Schedule" (ii) the word "material" (in lower case) shall be disregarded in (1) the second sentence of Section 5.7, (2) the second and third sentences of Section 5.9; and (iii) the word "materially" shall be disregarded in the first and second sentence of Section 5.15. 44
(b) The Purchaser will, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers from and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses asserted against or suffered by Sellers and each of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Seller Group") relating to, resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach of any warranty or the inaccuracy of any representation of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement, it being understood that for purposes of this 9.2(b) in determining whether there has been a breach of any representation or warranty contained in Article VI of this Agreement or the amount of any losses resulting from any such breach, the word "materially" in the first and second sentence of Section 6.4 shall be disregarded, (ii) any breach by Purchaser of any covenant in this Agreement or any failure of Purchaser to perform any of their obligations contained in this Agreement or (iii) the Assumed Liabilities; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of Section 9.5, the Purchaser shall be required to indemnify, defend and hold harmless under clause (i) of this Section 9.2(b) with respect to Indemnifiable Losses incurred by the Seller Group only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Indemnifiable Losses exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000) (and then only in the amount of such excess), and provided further, that the aggregate liability of the Purchaser under clause (i) of this Section 9.2(b) shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the Closing Purchase Price. (c) Either the party required to provide indemnification under this Agreement (the "Indemnifying Party") or the party entitled to receive indemnification under this Agreement (the "Indemnitee") may assert any offset or similar right in respect of its obligations under this Section 9.2 based upon any actual breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement. (d) Any Indemnitee having a claim under these indemnification provisions shall make a good faith effort to recover all losses, damages, costs and expenses from third party insurers of such Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies so as to reduce the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss hereunder. The amount of any Indemnifiable Loss shall be reduced to the extent that Indemnitee receives any insurance proceeds with respect to an Indemnifiable Loss from a third party (non-captive) insurer (net of one year's increase in premiums payable to such third party insurer). For purposes of this Agreement, payments made by a third party insurer administering claims under a fronting policy or any self-insurance program shall not be considered payments by a third party (non-captive) insurer. The expiration, termination or extinguishment of any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty shall not affect the parties' obligations under this Section 9.2 if the Indemnitee provided the Indemnifying Party with notice of the claim or event for which indemnification is sought prior to such expiration, termination or extinguishment. 9.3 Defense of Claims (a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of the commencement of any claim, action, or proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or any affiliate of a party to this Agreement (a "Third Party Claim") with respect to which indemnification is to be sought 45
from an Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. Such notice shall describe the nature of the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and will indicate the estimated amount, if practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or, by giving written notice to the Indemnitee, to elect to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and the Indemnitee will cooperate in good faith in such defense at such Indemnitee's own expense. (b) If within ten (10) calendar days after an Indemnitee provides written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any Third Party Claim the Indemnitee receives written notice from the Indemnifying Party that such Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim as provided in the last sentence of Section 9.3(a), the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within twenty (20) calendar days (unless waiting twenty (20) calendar days would prejudice the Indemnitee's rights) after receiving notice from the Indemnitee that the Indemnitee believes the Indemnifying Party has failed to take such steps, the Indemnitee may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable expenses thereof. The Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnitee to participate in such defense or settlement through counsel chosen by the Indemnitee, with the fees and expenses of such counsel borne by the Indemnitee unless under applicable standards of professional conduct a conflict may exist between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee in which event the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim which would lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee for which the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee for which the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party will give written notice to the Indemnitee to that effect. If the Indemnitee fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) calendar days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnitee may continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim will be the amount of such settlement offer, plus reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Indemnitee up to the date of such notice. (c) If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any third party (non captive) insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other entity, the amount of such reduction, less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection therewith (together with interest thereon from the date 46
of payment thereof at the prime rate as of the Closing Date), will promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any indemnity payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party (non-captive) insurer in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the indemnity payment relates; provided, however, that (i) for purposes of this Agreement, payments made by a third party insurer administering claims under a fronting policy or any self-insurance program shall not be considered payments by a third party (non-captive) insurer, (ii) the Indemnifying Party will then be in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and (iii) until the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Indemnifiable Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third party (non-captive) insurer on account of said indemnity payment is hereby made expressly subordinated and subjected in right of payment to the Indemnitee's rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination rights. Nothing in this Section 9.3(d) shall be construed to require any party hereto to obtain or maintain any insurance coverage. (d) A failure to give timely notice as provided in this Section 9.3 will not affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder except if, and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the party which was entitled to receive such notice was actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. 9.4 Remedies Exclusive Except for intentional fraud and for injunctive relief to enforce the Purchaser's or Sellers' rights under this Agreement, if the Closing occurs, the remedies set forth in this Article IX will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement (including any covenant, obligation, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) or otherwise in respect of the sale of the Purchased Assets contemplated hereby. Each of the Purchaser and Sellers waive any provision of law to the extent that it would limit or restrict the agreements contained in this Article IX. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree that the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser (i) with respect to the profitability of any Modernization Contract shall be the post-closing adjustment set forth in Section 3.3 and (ii) with respect to the loss of customers or the cancellation or termination of any Assumed Contract or other customer contract, including as a result of the failure to obtain consent to assignment of any Material Maintenance Contract, shall be the right provided pursuant to the condition to closing set forth in Section 8.2(d) and the post closing adjustment set forth in Section 7.10(c); provided that, with respect to (ii), the indemnification rights set forth in 9.2(a) shall also apply in the event that (A) such customer loss or contract cancellation or termination arose from material breach or material non-performance of such contract prior to the Closing Date and (B) Seller shall have retained liability for such material breach or material non-performance in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4(c). 47
9.5 Comprehensive Basket. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the basket provisions contained in Sections 3.3 ($1,000,000, with respect to Modernization Losses), 7.10 ($500,000, with respect to qualifying unobtained Requested Required Consents) and 9.2(a) ($1,000,000, with respect to Indemnifiable Losses) shall not apply at such time as the losses or related items otherwise aggregating under all such provisions for purposes of reaching the basket thresholds contained therein exceed one million two hundred and fifty thousand ($1,250,000) (the "Comprehensive Basket"); provided that Purchaser shall only be permitted to collect for any losses (or related items) aggregating under all such provisions in the amount of the excess of the Comprehensive Basket. For avoidance or doubt and for purposes of illustration: in the event that Seller would otherwise be required to indemnify and pay Purchaser in respect of Indemnifiable Losses but for the basket contained in 9.2(a), if the sum of (x) Modernization Losses (as determined under Section 3.3), (y) revenue losses in respect of qualifying unobtained Requested Required Consents (as calculated under Section 7.10) and (z) such Indemnifiable Losses total more than $1,250,000 in the aggregate, Purchaser shall be entitled to payments from Seller in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses notwithstanding the basket contained in Section 9.2(a) (but only to the extent of the excess of such total above the Comprehensive Basket). ARTICLE X TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT 10.1 Termination (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to Closing Date, by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Sellers. (b) This Agreement may be terminated by Sellers or by Purchaser if (i) the transactions contemplated hereby shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2003 (the "Termination Date"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to either such party if such party's failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before such date. (c) This Agreement may be terminated by Sellers or by Purchaser if (i) any Governmental Authority, the consent or approval of which is a condition to the obligations of Sellers and Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, shall have determined not to grant its consent or approval and all appeals of such determination shall have been taken and have been unsuccessful, or (ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a statute, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated hereby and such statute, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that all parties hereto shall have used their commercially reasonable efforts to remove such restraint, enjoinment or prohibition. 48
(d) This Agreement may be terminated by Purchaser, if there has been a material violation or breach by Sellers of any agreement, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has rendered the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Purchaser set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or (b) hereof impossible, such violation or breach has not been waived by Purchaser, and the violation or breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following Purchaser's written notice of the violation or breach; provided, however, that if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days and Sellers have commenced and are diligently proceeding to cure such breach, this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this subsection (d). (e) This Agreement may be terminated by Sellers, if there has been a material violation or breach by Purchaser of any agreement, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which has rendered the satisfaction of any condition to the obligations of Sellers set forth in Sections 8.3(a) or (b) hereof impossible, such violation or breach has not been waived by Sellers, or the violation or breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following either Sellers' written notice of the violation or breach; provided, however, that if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days and Purchaser has commenced and is diligently proceeding to cure such breach, this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to this subsection (e). 10.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination In the event of termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the transactions contemplated hereby by either or both of the parties pursuant to Section 10.1, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party and this Agreement shall terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, and all obligations of the parties hereunder will terminate without liability of any party to the other party (except for any liability of any party then in material breach of this Agreement); provided that the provisions of Sections 7.3 and 7.5 of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement will survive the termination and remain in full force and effect thereafter). If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein, all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the agency or other person to which they were made. ARTICLE XI MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 11.1 Amendment and Modification This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written mutual agreement executed and delivered by each of the Sellers and Purchaser. 49
11.2 Waiver of Compliance; Consents Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein may be waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. 11.3 Notices All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by facsimile transmission, telexed or mailed by overnight courier or registered or certified mail (return receipt requested), postage prepaid, to the parties at the following addresses (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified by like notice; provided that notices of a change of address shall be effective only upon receipt thereof): (a) If to Sellers: ABM Industries Incorporated 160 Pacific Avenue, Suite 222 San Francisco, California 94111 Attention: General Counsel Facsimile: (415) 733-7333 with copies to: Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP Four Times Square New York, NY 10036 Attention: Eileen Nugent, Esq.

SAN FRANCISCO, September 9, 2003  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM) today reported net income for the quarter ended July 31, 2003 of $11.7 million ($0.23 per diluted share) compared to $12.6 million ($0.25 per diluted share) reported for the third quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result of the previously announced sale of the assets of Amtech Elevator Services to Otis Elevator on August 15, 2003, results from the Elevator segment have been reclassified as income from discontinued operations. Revenues from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2003 were $569.1 million, up 9% from $520.0 million in the third quarter of 2002. Income from continuing operations for the quarter ended July 31, 2003 was $10.6 million ($0.21 per diluted share) compared to $11.9 million ($0.23 per diluted share) for the third quarter of fiscal 2002.
A number of events affected the comparability of the quarters. The quarter ended July 31, 2002 benefited from a $5.7 million gain ($3.6 million after-tax) from a partial settlement on the World Trade Center insurance claim, a $2.0 million tax benefit from the adjustment of tax liabilities resulting from the filing of the 2001 tax returns, and a related $0.6 million tax benefit from reducing the estimated tax rate for 2002 from 38.0% to 36.3%. The third quarter of 2002 was adversely affected by a $3.1 million provision ($1.9 million after-tax) for costs associated with the elimination of the Chief Administrative Officer position, the early retirement of the Corporate General Counsel and the replacement of the President of the ABM Facility Services.
 
The quarter ended July 31, 2003 includes revenues and operating profits generated by the operations of Lakeside Building Maintenance acquired in July 2002, the self-performed janitorial operations of Horizon National Commercial Services acquired in January 2003 and the commercial parking operations of Valet Parking Service acquired in May 2003. Third quarter 2003 operating profits also include a $0.7 million tax benefit from the adjustment of tax liabilities resulting from the filing of the 2002 tax returns during the quarter.
     Net income for the nine months ended July 31, 2003 was $26.0 million ($0.52 per diluted share) compared to $34.6 million ($0.68 per diluted share) reported for the first nine months of fiscal 2002. Income from continuing operations for the nine months ended July 31, 2003 was $23.6 million ($0.47 per diluted share) compared to $32.9 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2002 ($0.64 per diluted share). Revenues from continuing operations for the first nine months of 2003 were $1,684.1 million up 11% from $1,523.0 million in the comparable 2002 period. In addition to the unusual items noted above, the nine months ended July 31, 2002 included an additional $4.3 million ($2.7 million after-tax) gain recognized in the second quarter of 2002 from the initial proceeds from the World Trade Center insurance claim.
     On August 29, 2003, ABM acquired the operations of HGO, Inc., a provider of janitorial services based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Assets acquired by ABM include key accounts in the eastern United States. The terms of the acquisition include a cash payment made at closing of $12.8 million, plus contingent payments based on income improvement and contract retention during the three years commencing September 1, 2003. Annual revenues from the acquisition are approximately $40 million. The operating results generated from these assets
 
will be included in the consolidated financial results of ABM Industries effective September 1, 2003.
     "Third quarter performance was solid in spite of some weakness in a couple of isolated areas and continued tightening of customers' budgets that reduced higher margin capital project work and extra services," said Henrik C. Slipsager, ABM's President & Chief Executive Officer. "While not reflected in our third quarter results, the completion of the successful sale of Amtech Elevator Services to Otis Elevator and the acquisition of HGO, Inc., a premier janitorial operation in Philadelphia, are significant accomplishments that will be beneficial for ABM and its stockholders in the future," said Slipsager.
     "Our cash flow from operations continued to be strong in the quarter, and with the sale of Elevator we have a cash surplus never seen before. We expect over time to continue to make acquisitions in our core services. Despite the good news associated with our recent acquisitions, we anticipate that the challenging economic environment will continue for the remainder of fiscal 2003," said Slipsager. "We expect income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2003 to be approximately $0.25 per diluted share. Net income for the fourth quarter including the gain on the sale of our elevator services business to Otis Elevator, will be approximately $1.25 per diluted share."
     Wednesday morning, September 10th, at 6:00 a.m. (Pacific Daylight Time), ABM will host a live webcast of remarks by President & Chief Executive Officer Henrik C. Slipsager and Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer George B.

SAN FRANCISCO, December 9, 2003  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM) today reported its income from continuing operations for the quarter ended October 31, 2003 was $12.8 million ($0.26 per diluted share) up 15% compared to $ 11.1 million ($0.22 per diluted share) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Sales and other income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were $578.4 million, up 4% from $555.1 million for the fourth quarter of the prior year. Net income for the quarter ended October 31, 2003, which included an after-tax gain of $51.5 million ($1.03 per diluted share) as a result of the previously announced sale of the assets of Amtech Elevator Services to Otis Elevator ("Otis") on August 15, 2003, was $64.5 million ($1.29 per diluted share) compared to $12.1 million ($0.24 per diluted share) for fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.
     The quarter ended October 31, 2003 included a $1.1 million ($0.7 million after-tax) settlement for prior period services performed related to a managed parking lot contract in Houston which was substantially offset by a provision of $1.0 million ($0.6 million after-tax) for parking sales taxes for prior years based on a sales tax audit. The 2003 fourth quarter also included revenues and operating profits generated by the self-performed janitorial operations of Horizon National Commercial Services acquired in January 2003, the commercial parking operations of Valet Parking Service acquired in May 2003 and the operations of HGO, Inc., a provider of janitorial services based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, acquired in August 2003. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 included $1.0 million of interest income ($0.6 million after-tax) from the resolution of past due balances with two janitorial customers, as well as a $0.5 million gain ($0.3 million after-tax) on the early termination of a parking lease.
     Income from continuing operations for the year ended October 31, 2003 was $36.4 million ($0.73 per diluted share) compared to $ 44.1 million ($0.86 per diluted share) for fiscal 2002, Sales and other income for the year 2003 were $2,262.5 million, up 9% from $2,068.1 million for the prior year.

     A number of events affected the comparability of the years. In addition to the fourth quarter items previously discussed income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2002 benefited from a $10.0 million gain ($6.3 million after-tax) from two partial settlements on the World Trade Center insurance claim, and a $2.0 million tax benefit from the adjustment of prior-year estimated tax liabilities. Fiscal year 2002 was adversely affected by a $3.2 million provision ($2.0 million after-tax) for costs associated with the elimination of the Chief Administrative Officer position, the early retirement of the Corporate General Counsel and the replacement of the President of the ABM Facility Services. Fiscal year 2003 benefited from the
 
previously discussed acquisitions completed in 2003 and a full year of revenue and operating profits generated from Lakeside Building Maintenance which was acquired in July 2002.
     "Fourth quarter performance was solid across all operating segments," said Henrik C. Slipsager, ABM's President & Chief Executive Officer. "In addition to our solid quarter, we are extremely pleased with the completion of the successful sale of the operating assets of our Elevator segment to Otis Elevator and the acquisition of HGO, Inc., a premier janitorial operation," said Slipsager.
     "With $111 million of cash at year-end and no debt, we are in a financial position that ABM has never seen before. We expect over time to continue to make acquisitions in our core services, " said Slipsager. " Looking into the new year, all operations are seeing a marked increase in business activity which bodes well for the future. Excluding any acquisition, we expect income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2004 will be in the range of $0.80- $0.90 per diluted share."

"ABM now will be a truly nationwide security company, which is important as customers move their business to national accounts. With this acquisition, ABM will be one of the largest American-owned security companies."
     "We expect the long term financial impact of this acquisition to be very good," stated Slipsager. "Short term, while accretive to earnings, the results will reflect the necessary investments in infrastructure for SSA to meet ABM governance standards."
     Slipsager continued, "We have great expectations for the growth in the security business long term as well as short term, and the acquisition of SSA will give us new opportunities in this market."
     SSA will join American Commercial Security Services as ABM's principal security operations. "We are excited to have the SSA management team join ABM," said John Moore, president of ACSS. "Jim Stevens and his Team SSA have done a great job in building a fine company in a relatively short time. Working with the SSA team, we all will be better able to serve our customers," Moore added.

SAN FRANCISCO, March 9, 2004  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM) today reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was $7.2 million ($0.14 per diluted share) compared to $4.3 million ($0.09 per diluted share) for the prior year first quarter. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 includes $0.6 million ($0.01 per diluted share) after-tax operating income from the Elevator operations that were sold to Otis Elevator in the fourth quarter of 2003. Sales and other income for the first quarter of 2004 were $570.8 million, up 3.3% from $552.4 million in the first quarter of 2003.
     Income from continuing operations for the first quarter 2004 was $7.2 million ($0.14 per diluted share) up 90.8% compared to $3.8 million ($0.08 per diluted share) for the prior year's first quarter. Janitorial, Engineering, Parking and Security generated higher operating results. Additionally, results for the first quarter of 2004 benefited from the positive impact from the Janitorial and Parking acquisitions completed in the last nine months of fiscal year 2003. The quarter ended January 31, 2004 included a decline in our net cash position due to estimated tax payments of $30.7 million, primarily for the fourth quarter 2003 gain on sale of the Elevator divestiture. Partially offsetting this payment, was cash flow from continuing operations of $14.0 million compared to $17.5 million in the first quarter of 2003.
     "I am pleased with our first quarter results although Lighting continues to suffer from the lack of growth in capital project sales," said Henrik C. Slipsager, ABM's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are very excited about the just-announced agreement to acquire the operating assets of Security Services of America ("SSA"). We believe that the business climate reflected in our first quarter performance in combination with the SSA acquisition will result in 2004 earnings in the range of $0.85  $0.90 per diluted share," he added.
     Wednesday morning, March 10, at 6:00 a.m. (PST), ABM will host a live webcast of remarks by President & Chief Executive Officer Henrik C.

     The disclosure and analysis in the Company's public filings with the United States Security and Exchange Commission, such as reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K, contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management's plans and assumptions. From time to time, the Company also provides forward-looking statements in other written materials released to the public as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give the Company's current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management tries, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "plan", "project," and similar expressions. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts, expenses, and the outcome of contingencies and other uncertainties, such as legal proceedings, and financial results.
     Set forth below are factors that the Company thinks, individually or in the aggregate, could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from past results or those anticipated, estimated or projected. The Company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The public should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the following should not be considered to be a complete list of all potential risks or uncertainties: (1) A further decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect the Company's sales and profitability. (2) An increase in costs that the Company cannot pass on to customers could affect profitability. (3) The financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of the Company's major customers could adversely affect results. (4) The Company could experience major collective bargaining disputes that would lead to the loss of sales or expense increases. (5) The Company is subject to intense competition. (6) The Company's success depends on its ability to preserve its long-term relationships with its customers. (7) Weakness in airline travel and the hospitality industry could adversely impact the Company's Parking results. (8) A continued slowdown in capital investments by customers could negatively impact the project sales of the Lighting and Mechanical segments. (9) Acquisition activity could slow or be unsuccessful. (10) The Company incurs significant accounting and other control costs, which could increase. (11) An inadequacy in the Company's self-insurance reserves, or the cancellation or non-renewal of the Company's primary insurance policies, could adversely impact the Company's results. (12) Other issues and uncertainties which may include: labor shortages that adversely affect the Company's ability to employ entry level personnel, a reduction or revocation of the Company's line of credit that could increase interest expense and the cost of capital, legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally impacts the Company's expenses or reduces sales by adversely affecting the Company's customers such as state or locally-mandated healthcare benefits, new accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies, impairment of goodwill, the resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more of the Company's key executives that adversely affects customer retention or day-to-day management of the Company, and inclement weather which could disrupt the Company in providing its services.
     The Company believes that it has the services, human and financial resources for business success, but future profit and cash flow can be adversely (or advantageously) influenced by a number of factors, including those listed above, any and all of which are inherently difficult to forecast. The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2003, contains additional information with respect to the factors that could influence its business. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

SAN FRANCISCO, June 8, 2004  The Board of Directors of ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM) has declared an all-time-high third quarter cash dividend of $0.10 per common share payable on August 2, 2004 to stockholders of record on July 12, 2004. This will be ABM's 153rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend, and is $0.005 (5.3%) above the $0.095 per share quarterly dividend rate paid in the third quarter of 2003.
     ABM Industries Incorporated is one of the largest facility services contractors listed on the New York Stock Exchange. With fiscal 2003 revenues in excess of $2.2 billion and more than 70,000 employees, ABM provides janitorial, parking, engineering, security, lighting and mechanical services for thousands of commercial, industrial, institutional and retail facilities in hundreds of cities in the United States and British Columbia, Canada. The ABM Family of Services includes ABM Janitorial, Ampco System Parking, ABM Engineering, American Commercial Security (ACSS), Security Services of America (SSA), Amtech Lighting, CommAir Mechanical and ABM Facility Services.

 
EXHIBIT 99.2
George B. Sundby Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer ABM Industries Incorporated (415) 733-4000
today reported net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 of $6.8 million ($0.14 per diluted share) compared to $9.9 million ($0.20 per diluted share) for the prior year second quarter. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 includes $0.6 million ($0.02 per diluted share) after-tax income from the Elevator operations that were sold to Otis Elevator in the fourth quarter of 2003. Sales and other income for the second quarter of 2004 were $590.3 million, up 4.9% from $562.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2003.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  June 8, 2004  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
Net income for the second quarter includes two more days of labor expense on fixed-price Janitorial contracts compared to the same period last year of approximately $2.3 million ($0.05 per diluted share) after-tax. The second quarter results also include a $1.4 million ($0.03 per diluted share) after-tax non-cash expense associated with ABM's adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02-17, "Recognition of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination," that was effective for business combinations completed after October 25, 2002(1) and resulting catch-up amortization booked in the second quarter of 2004. EITF No. 02-17 requires a purchaser to use the expected life of the customer relationship versus the contractual life of a contract in its valuation of intangible assets acquired. This intangible amortization expense has no cash impact on the Company.
Commenting on the results, Henrik Slipsager, ABM's President & Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Operational performance was solid. Quarterly sales reached an all time quarterly high and earnings, exclusive of intangible amortization expense, were in line with previous guidance. I am also very pleased with the initial performance and integration of our recent acquisition  Security Services of America (SSA). Due to the timing, this acquisition only contributed 45 days of revenue and earnings to the second quarter's results. We look forward to a full quarter of its contributions to the results in the third quarter."
 
"The one disappointing performance came in Lighting, which remained adversely impacted by reduced retrofit projects. We have cut costs and taken a number of other steps to improve our results there. Last week, we announced that Eric Lazear has rejoined ABM as President of Lighting. Eric successfully led our Elevator operations for many years before it was sold. We are very excited to have Eric working for ABM once again."
Net income for the six months ended April 30, 2004 was $13.9 million ($0.28 per diluted share) compared to $14.2 million ($0.29 per diluted share) reported for the first six months of fiscal 2003. Net income for the first six months of fiscal 2003 includes $1.2 million ($0.03 per diluted share) after-tax income from the discontinued Elevator operations. Sales and other income for the first six months of 2004 were $1,161.2 million, up 4.1% from $1,115.0 million for the first half of 2003.
Mr. Slipsager stated, "Our financial position remains very strong. Given the strength of our balance sheet and operating cash flow from continuing operations of more than $22.0 million during the second quarter, we remain well positioned to grow our business. Based on our current business climate, and considering the additional non-cash amortization expense of approximately $1.0 million after-tax for the last half of the year associated with acquired customer relationships, we believe ABM will achieve fiscal 2004 earnings in the range of $0.80 to $0.85 per diluted share."
     Wednesday morning, June 9th, at 9:00 a.m. (EDT), ABM will host a live webcast of remarks by President & Chief Executive Officer Henrik C. Slipsager, and Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer George B. Sundby. The webcast will be accessible at http://www.irconnect.com/primecast/04/q2/abm_2q2004.html.

Item 1.01  
Entry into Material Definitive Agreement.
     On December 6 and December 7, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of ABM Industries Incorporated ("Registrant") approved amendments to the Registrant's stock option plans changing the definition of "fair market value" used in the Registrant's stock option plans when used in reference to the date of grant of an option, the date of surrender of Common Stock in payment for the purchase of shares pursuant to the exercise of option, or the prices used for the determination of early vesting under Registrant's price-vested stock option plans to the closing price of Registrant's common stock as quoted in the composite transaction Index for the New York Stock Exchange on the day prior to such date as published in the "Wall Street Journal," or if no sale price was quoted in any such Index on such date, then as of the next preceding date on which such a sale price was quoted. Prior plan definitions had varied and the change will simplify administration. In addition, Registrant will use the plan definition in determining fair market value for purposes of collecting withholding on the exercise of nonqualified stock options. This definition will apply to grants after December 6, 2004 for purposes of the date of grant of an option and to all grants for all other purposes.
     The form of agreement for the Registrant's 2002 Price-Vested Stock Option Plan provides for early vesting at such time as the fair market value of the common stock shall have been equal to or greater than the assigned vesting price for ten trading days in any period of thirty consecutive trading days. On December 6, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Registrant approved an amendment to the form of agreement for the Registrant's 2002 Price-Vested Stock Option Plan to raise the assigned vesting prices from $20.00, $22.50, $25.00, and $27.50 to $22.50, $25.00, $27.50, and $30.00. This change is effective for grants on and after December 6, 2004.
     On December 6, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors amended its Service Award Benefit Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans to establish an administrative committee to administer those plans and to give the administrative committee the authority to amend the plans to bring them into compliance with applicable law or to make such other changes as the administrative committee deems desirable provided that such changes do not materially increase the costs of the plan to ABM or take the plan out of compliance with applicable law. The Compensation Committee has determined that no additional participants will be added to these plans and the administrative committee has no authority to name additional participants.
     On December 6, 2004, the Compensation Committee approved the establishment of the ABM Executive Retiree Healthcare and Dental Plan. This plan will offer retirement health insurance coverage for certain retired executives of the Registrant, including executive officers. The costs for such insurance will be borne entirely by participants except for the Company's existing contractual obligations with five of its current and retired executives to make certain contributions toward retirement health insurance costs.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On December 13, 2004, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release that reported, among other things, a change in methodology associated with its insurance reserves, adverse developments in its insurance reserves and expected sales and income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 31, 2004. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 4.02 Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
     The December 13, 2004 press release incorporated by reference in Item 2.02 announced that the Company was changing the methodology associated with insurance reserves, which will move its insurance reserves to an actuarial point estimate. The effect of this change will be to increase the Company's self-insurance reserves at October 31, 2004 by $27 million. The Company is evaluating whether generally accepted accounting principles require that the $27 million adjustment (approximately $16.4 million after-tax or approximately $0.33 per diluted share) to self-insurance reserves related to this change in accounting methodology be reflected in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 results or whether up to approximately $22 million should be allocated to prior years. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has discussed this issue with both management and the Company's independent auditors.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
     The information required by this Item is included in Items 2.02 and 4.02.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On December 13, 2004 ABM Industries Incorporated issued a press release announcing that a quarterly dividend of $0.105 per share would be paid on February 7, 2005, to the record holders of common stock as of the close of business on January 14, 2005. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.2, which is incorporated into this item by reference.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     99.1 Press release dated December 13, 2004 disclosing a change in the Company's methodology associated with its insurance reserves, adverse developments in its insurance reserves and expected sales and income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 31, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1
SAN FRANCISCO  December 13, 2004  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM) announced today that it will delay issuing its audited earnings release while the Company completes an evaluation of the appropriate accounting treatment for a change in methodology associated with its insurance reserves. The change in accounting methodology will increase the Company's self-insurance reserves at October 31, 2004 by $27 million. ABM expects to report audited financial results for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 as soon as its evaluation of the appropriate accounting treatment is completed.
ABM also announced that in its annual actuarial review, the Company learned of adverse developments in its insurance reserves related to workers' compensation claims in the State of California during the four-year period ended October 31, 2003, and will record in the fourth quarter of 2004, a $15 million ($9.1 million after-tax or $0.18 per diluted share) increase in its insurance reserves related to the adverse developments. The Company believes a substantial portion of the $15 million increase is related to poor claims management by a third party administrator and is taking action to mitigate the impact.
Excluding any impact from the increases in insurance reserves, ABM expects income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2004 to be $14.5 million ($0.29 per diluted share) up 13% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2003. The quarter ended October 31, 2004 benefited from one fewer workday and from recent acquisitions. Sales and other income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 are expected to be $630.9 million, up 9% from $578.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
Excluding any impact from the increases in insurance reserves, income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2004 is expected to be $41.9 million ($0.84 per diluted share) up 15% when compared to the year ended October 31, 2003. ABM also reported that sales and other income for fiscal 2004 are expected to be $2,416 million, up 6.8% from fiscal 2003. All operations, except Lighting, generated higher sales and operating profits. Results for 2004 benefited from recent acquisitions in Security and Janitorial, new business, and one fewer day of labor expense in the Janitorial operations, partially offset by higher state income taxes.
The Company believes that its 2004 income from continuing operations will range between approximately $0.33 per diluted share if the entire expense related to the accounting methodology change is taken in 2004 and approximately $ 0.60 per diluted share if portions of the expense are required to be included in prior periods. If the Company recognizes the entire expense related to the change in accounting methodology in the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company will have a loss for the quarter of approximately $0.22 per diluted share as compared to fourth quarter 2004 income of
 
approximately $0.05 per diluted shares if portions of the expense are required to be included in prior periods.
Henrik Slipsager, ABM's President & Chief Executive Officer, stated, "Nothing in today's announcement concerning insurance reserves alters the fact that our operating divisions delivered another quarter and year of record revenue and solid income. We congratulate our business leaders and our exceptional employees on their fine operational results."
Slipsager continued, "Our projections for next year's financial performance reflect our great confidence in the future. Excluding any 2005 acquisitions and including the impact of one additional workday, we expect income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2005 will be in the range of $0.95 to $1.00 per diluted share. We expect first quarter 2005 income from continuing operations in the range of $0.14 to $0.16 per diluted share, which also includes the effect of one additional workday."
Slipsager concluded, "While we are committed to promptly resolving the issues regarding self-insurance reserves, our primary focus remains on delivering services to meet the increasing demands of our customers, and continuing to build upon our fiscal 2004 operating results."
The Company is in the process of transferring administration of workers' compensation claims reported in the State of California during the four-year period ended October 31, 2003 from one administrator to a second third party administrator, which has been more successfully handling ABM's claims reported since November 1, 2003.
Workers' Compensation Claims Management
George Sundby, ABM's Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, stated, "We are taking steps to mitigate the adverse development in our workers' compensation claims incurred before November 1, 2003. Don Hroch recently joined ABM as our new Vice President of Risk Management. We believe that his expertise will result in improved management of our insurance costs. We fully expect that the transfer of claims management to our other third party administrator will reduce the ultimate projected settlement costs of our outstanding claims."
In addition to moving its claims administration, ABM is currently evaluating remedies to recover damages from the third party administrator.
Excluding any impact from the change in methodology in determining insurance reserves and taking into consideration the charge related to the adverse workers' compensation developments, the Company expects income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2004 to be $32.8 million ($0.66 per diluted share), and for the fourth quarter of 2004 to be $5.4 million ($0.11 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 2004.
 
ABM's methodology change for establishing insurance reserves will move its insurance reserves to an actuarial point estimate and will increase the Company's self-insurance reserves at October 31, 2004 by $27 million of which $2.6 million relates to the $15 million reserve increase from the adverse workers' compensation development. The Company is evaluating whether generally accepted accounting principles require that the $27 million adjustment (approximately $16.4 million after-tax or approximately $0.33 per diluted share) to self-insurance reserves related to a change in accounting methodology be reflected in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 results or whether up to approximately $22 million should be allocated to prior years.
Self-Insurance Reserve Accounting Methodology
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (1) the accounting treatment of the reserve adjustment in the Company's consolidated statement of income under generally accepted accounting principles; (2) adjustments to the Company's unaudited financial statements that may be determined to be necessary prior to their finalization; (3) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect the Company's sales and profitability; (4) an increase in costs that the Company cannot pass on to customers could affect profitability; (5) the financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of the Company's major customers could adversely affect results; (6) the Company could experience major collective bargaining disputes that would lead to the loss of sales or expense increases; (7) the Company is subject to intense competition; (8) the Company's success depends on its ability to preserve its long-term relationships with its customers; (9) weakness in airline travel and the hospitality industry could adversely impact the Company's Parking results; (10) low levels of capital investments by customers could negatively impact the project sales of the Lighting and Mechanical segments, (11) acquisition activity could slow or be unsuccessful; (12) the Company incurs significant accounting and other control costs, which could increase; (13) the cancellation or non-renewal of the Company's primary insurance policies and a deterioration in claims management by a third party administrator, could adversely impact the Company's results; and (14) other issues and uncertainties which may include: labor shortages that adversely affect the Company's ability to employ entry level personnel, a reduction or revocation of the Company's line of credit that could increase interest expense and the cost of capital, legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally impacts the Company's expenses or reduces sales by adversely affecting the Company's customers such as state or locally-mandated healthcare benefits, new accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, the resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more of the Company's key executives that adversely affects customer retention or day-to-day management of the Company, and inclement weather which could disrupt the Company in providing its services.

Item 2.02.    Results of Operations and Financial Condition
     On December 20, 2004, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release reporting the effect of the accounting restatement described below under Item 4.02 on its results of operations for certain completed annual and quarterly periods. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated by reference herein.
Item 4.02.    Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
     As reported in the Company's December 13, 2004 Form 8-K Current Report, the Company announced that it was changing its methodology for insurance reserves to move its insurance reserves to an actuarial point estimate, the effect of which would be to increase the Company's self-insurance reserves at October 31, 2004 by $27 million. The Company also announced that it was evaluating whether generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) required that the $27 million adjustment be reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 results or whether up to approximately $22 million of the adjustment should be allocated to prior years.
     The Company has completed its evaluation and on December 14, 2004, senior management of the Company determined that, in accordance with GAAP, $22 million of the adjustment should be allocated to prior years as a correction of an error. As a result, the Company will restate its financial statements for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2000 to October 31, 2003 and its quarterly financial statements for all quarters of fiscal year 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004 in its Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2004. Accordingly, the previously issued financial statements for the above periods, which accrued insurance reserves at the bottom of a range between 85 percent to 115 percent of the actuarial point estimate, should no longer be relied upon.
     Although the correction of prior insurance reserves has necessitated the restatement, the restated financials will also reflect the correction of the fair value calculation for other intangibles, primarily customer relationship intangibles, under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 02-17, "Recognition of Customer Relationship Intangible Assets Acquired in a Business Combination" as discussed in detail in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Company's Form 10-Q for the second quarter ended April 30, 2004. EITF Issue No. 02-17 provided guidance regarding the use of certain assumptions, such as expectations of future contract renewals, in estimating the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination. EITF Issue No. 02-17 was effective for business combinations consummated after October 25, 2002, but the Company did not reflect the effect it would have had on the three business combinations completed in 2003 until the second quarter of 2004.
     The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has discussed the correction of methodology for insurance reserves and the treatment of the correction under GAAP, as well as the other correction, with both management and the Company's independent auditors.
     The Company currently estimates the impact of the adjustments on income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share would be as follows:

announced that it has completed the previously announced evaluation of accounting treatment for a change in methodology associated with its insurance reserves. The Company has determined that $22 million of the $27 million adjustment should be allocated to prior years as a correction of an error. As a result, the Company will restate its financial statements for the four fiscal years ended October 31, 2000 to October 31, 2003, and its quarterly financial statements for all quarters of fiscal year 2003 and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2004 in its Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2004. Accordingly, the previously issued financial statements for the above periods should no longer be relied upon.

The employment agreements of Henrik C. Slipsager and William T. ("Terry") Petty, which call for 2005 target bonuses of 50% of base compensation, subject to performance modifiers of 0 to 150%, remain unchanged.

Item 8.01 Other Events
On February 9, 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted summary judgment in favor of ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") against Zurich American Insurance Company on ABM's insurance claims for business interruption losses resulting from the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster. ABM's business interruption losses and other covered losses are eligible for coverage up to the policy maximum of $127 million. The press release discussing the ruling is attached as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM) announced today that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit had granted summary judgment in favor of ABM on the Company's insurance claims for business interruption losses resulting from the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  February 10, 2005 
          The Appeals Court also ruled that ABM is entitled to recovery for the extra expenses it incurred after 9/11, which include millions of dollars related to increased unemployment claims and costs associated with the redeployment of WTC personnel at other facilities. The Appeals Court rejected the arguments of Zurich American Insurance Co. (Zurich) to limit ABM's business interruption coverage and returned the case to the Southern District of New York for determination of appropriate additional compensation under the policy.
          "We are very pleased with the Court's ruling," said Linda S. Auwers, ABM Senior Vice President & General Counsel. "Since the Court of Appeals has established our business interruption coverage and ruled on several of the case's central issues, we look forward to a fair and timely resolution of our claims with Zurich."
          ABM will continue to pursue its claims against Zurich. Under the policy, coverage for ABM's business interruption and other related losses is capped at $127 million. ABM believes its losses exceed $100 million.
          ABM had commercial insurance policies with Zurich covering business interruption, property damage and other losses related to the WTC complex. At the time, the WTC was the Company's largest single job-site with annual sales of approximately $75.0 million (3% of the Company's consolidated sales for 2001).
          In December 2001, Zurich filed a Declaratory Judgment Action in the Southern District of New York claiming the loss of the business profit fell under the policy's contingent business interruption sub-limit of $10 million. On June 2, 2003, the court ruled on certain summary judgment motions in favor of Zurich. Subsequent to the June 2003 ruling, additional rulings by the court limited ABM's recourse under the policy to the amounts paid plus additional amounts related to physical property and financial records of the Company located on the WTC premises.
          As of October 31, 2004, Zurich had paid ABM two partial settlements totaling $13.8 million, of which $10.0 million was for business interruption under the contingent business interruption sub-limit and $3.8 million for property damage, which substantially settled the property portion of the claim.
 
          ABM Industries Incorporated is among the largest facility services contractors listed on the New York Stock Exchange. With fiscal 2004 revenues in excess of $2.4 billion and more than 73,000 employees, ABM provides janitorial, parking, security, engineering, lighting and mechanical services for thousands of commercial, industrial, institutional and retail facilities in hundreds of cities across the United States and British Columbia, Canada. The ABM Family of Services includes ABM Janitorial, Ampco System Parking, ABM Security Services, which includes American Commercial Security Services (ACSS) and Security Services of America (SSA), ABM Engineering, Amtech Lighting, CommAir Mechanical and ABM Facility Services.
Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to subsequent adverse judicial rulings in the Company's World Trade Center insurance litigation and each of the risks set forth in the Company's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

EXHIBIT 99.1
CONTACT: George B. Sundby Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ABM Industries Incorporated (415) 733-4000
a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $7.9 million ($0.16 per diluted share) up 25.4% compared to $6.3 million ($0.13 per diluted share) for the prior year first quarter. Sales and other income for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 increased 13.4% to $647.4 million from $570.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Net cash flow from continuing operating activities was $14.9 million, up 6.4% compared to $14.0 million for the comparable quarter last year.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  March 7, 2005  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
"We are very pleased with our first quarter performance," stated Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "All of our major operating units experienced gains in both sales and operating profits, including our Lighting business. In particular, Parking, Security, and Engineering businesses showed substantial year-over-year improvements. ABM's operating results benefited from contributions from acquisitions completed in the last twelve months, new contracts and an expansion of services with existing customers," he added.
"During the quarter, we extended our geographic reach with the acquisitions of Sentinel Guard Systems and Colin Service Systems," Mr. Slipsager continued. "These strategic acquisitions enhanced our security services in Los Angeles and San Francisco and our janitorial businesses in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states. In addition to these acquisitions, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in our Lighting business. This segment of our business is still a turnaround situation, but our move from being primarily focused on national coverage to targeted regional and local sales, coupled with adding new local salespersons in each of our key markets, is having a positive effect on our results," he added.
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "Our net cash flows from continuing operations improved by approximately 6% to $14.9 million, and we ended the quarter with $63 million in cash and cash equivalents, $235 million in working capital and no debt. Given our strong sales and marketing momentum, continued organic growth, and the benefit of recent acquisitions, we are increasing our fiscal 2005 guidance to $0.98 to $1.03 per diluted share. This is exclusive of future acquisitions, and does not include the adoption of SFAS 123R, which will require the Company to expense stock options and become effective in the Company's fourth quarter beginning August 1, 2005. Currently, the Company estimates that stock-based compensation expense for the fourth quarter of 2005 will be approximately $0.02 per diluted share. For the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we are projecting earnings per diluted share of $0.21 to $0.23. The second quarter has one less work day compared to the same period last year."

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On March 24, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") adopted performance objectives for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for its 2005 fiscal year, which will end on October 31, 2005. The employment agreement for the Chief Executive Officer calls for a bonus based upon his performance measured against performance objectives adopted by the Compensation Committee. The performance objectives are attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
     On March 24, 2005, the Compensation Committee also took a number of actions in furtherance of the Company's executive incentive program. These actions included an amendment to the Company's 2002 Price-Vested Performance Stock Option Plan to permit the Compensation Committee to make stock option grants with exercise prices at or above the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the day of grant. Prior to the amendment the 2002 Price-Vested Performance Stock Option Plan called for all grants to have exercise prices equal to fair market value of the Company's common stock on the day of grant.
     At the same meeting, the Compensation Committee adopted a non-qualified stock option agreement for use under the Time-Vested Incentive Stock Option Plan. The Compensation Committee has authority to make both incentive stock option grants and non-qualified stock option grants under the Time-Vested Incentive Stock Option Plan. The new form of non-qualified stock option agreement is attached as Exhibit 99.2.
     Under the current form of stock option agreement for the 2002 Price-Vested Performance Stock Option Plan, the Compensation Committee granted George B. Sundby, the Company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, an option to purchase 23,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $21.70 per share and under the new form of stock option agreement for the Time-Vested Incentive Stock Option Plan, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Sundby an option to purchase 28,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $21.81 per share. The "Fair Market Value" of a share of the Company's common stock at the time of grant for purposes of each of the plans was $19.21.

Employee Name,
          WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the "Time-Vested" Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), providing for the granting to its employees of stock options relating to shares of its common stock (the "Common Stock") and the administering of the Plan by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors ("Committee"); and
          WHEREAS, the Employee is an officer or key employee who is in a position to make an important contribution to the long-term performance of the Company;
          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants hereinafter set forth and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
          1.      The Company hereby grants to the Employee a non-qualified stock option to purchase shares of the Common Stock at the price set forth in Paragraph 2, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated. In consideration of the grant of this option and the other rights which are being concurrently granted to him, the Employee hereby agrees to continue in the employment of the Company for a period of at least one year from the date of grant of this option.

          2.      The purchase price per share is .
$XXXX
          3.      This option may not be exercised in whole or in part until ___. On ___, this option shall become exercisable with respect to twenty (20) percent of the number of shares stated in Paragraph 1. Upon the expiration of twelve (12) months from ___this option may be exercised to the extent of twenty (20) percent of the shares subject to the option plus the shares as to which the right to exercise the option has previously accrued but has not been exercised (for a total of 40%). Upon the expiration of the next twelve (12) month period thereafter, this option may be exercised to the extent of twenty (20) percent of the shares subject to the option plus the shares as to which the right to exercise the option has previously accrued but has not been exercised (for a total of 60%). Upon the expiration of the next twelve (12) month period thereafter, this option may be exercised to the extent of twenty (20) percent of the shares subject to the option plus the shares as to which the right to exercise the option has previously accrued but has not been exercised (for a total of 80%). Upon the expiration of the next twelve (12) month period thereafter, this option will be fully exercisable.
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this option is not exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date hereof.
          4.      The number of shares of Common Stock covered hereby and the price per share thereof shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of shares or the payment of a stock dividend, or any other increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company.
          If the Company shall be the surviving corporation in any merger or consolidation, this option (to the extent that it is still outstanding) shall pertain (unless the Committee determines the provisions of the following
 
sentence are applicable to such merger or consolidation) to and apply to the securities of which a holder of the same number of shares of Common Stock that are subject to the option would have been entitled. A dissolution or liquidation of the Company, a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or a "change in control" of the Company (as defined below) (each a "Terminating Transaction") shall cause this option to terminate, unless the agreement of merger or consolidation or any agreement relating to a dissolution liquidation or change in control shall otherwise provide, provided that the Employee in the event of a Terminating Transaction which will cause his option to terminate shall have the right immediately prior to such Terminating Transaction to exercise this option in whole or in part subject to every limitation on exercisability provided herein other than the vesting provision set forth in Paragraph 3. For purposes hereof, a "change in control" shall be deemed to have occurred when (i) a person or group of persons acquires fifty percent (50%) or more of the Company's voting securities, and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company or the Committee shall have determined that such a "change in control" has occurred or the criteria for a "change in control," as established by the Board or Committee has been satisfied.
          The foregoing adjustments shall be made by the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
          The grant of the options shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge or to consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate or sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
          5.      No partial exercise of this option will be permitted for fewer than twenty-five shares.
          6.      In the event of termination of the Employee's employment for any reason other than his death or disability, this option may not be exercised after three months after the date he ceases to be an employee of the Company.
          7.      This option shall be exercisable during the Employee's lifetime only by him and shall be nontransferable by the Employee otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
          8.      In the event the Employee ceases to be employed by the Company on account of his permanent and total disability within the meaning of Section 22(e)(3) of the Code (as determined by the Committee) this option may not be exercised after one year after cessation of employment due to such disability.
          9.      In the event of the Employee's death while in the employ of the Company, or during the three-month period following termination of employment during which the Employee is permitted to exercise this option pursuant to Paragraph 7, this option may not be exercised after the date one year after the Employee's death. During such one-year period, this option may be exercised by the executor or administrator of the Employee's estate or any person who shall have acquired the option from the Employee by his will or the applicable law of descent and distribution. During such one-year period, such option may be exercised with respect to the number of shares for which the deceased optionee would have been entitled to exercise it at the time of his death and also with respect to ten percent of the additional number of shares for which he would have been entitled to exercise it during the balance of the option period, had he survived and remained in the employ of the Company.

The purchase price shall be payable in cash.
          11.      Neither the Employee nor any person claiming under or through him shall be or have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any of the shares issuable upon the exercise of the
 
option until the date of receipt of payment (including any amounts required by income tax withholding requirements) by the Company.
          12.      Any notice to be given to the Company under the terms of this Agreement shall be addressed to ABM Industries Incorporated, in care of its Corporate Secretary, at 160 Pacific Avenue, Suite 222, San Francisco, California 94111, or at such other address as the Company may hereafter designate in writing.

          13.      Except as otherwise provided herein, the option herein granted and the rights and privileges conferred hereby shall not be transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to sale under execution, attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred hereby. Upon any attempt to transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of said option, or of any right or privilege conferred hereby, contrary to the provisions hereof, or upon any attempted sale under any execution, attachment or similar process upon the rights and privileges conferred hereby, said option and the rights and privileges conferred hereby shall immediately become null and void.
          14.      Subject to the limitations on transferability contained herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.
          15.      The rights awarded hereby are subject to the requirement that, if at any time the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of the shares of Common Stock subject to such rights upon any securities exchange or under any state or Federal law, or the consent or approval of any government regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the granting of such rights or issuance of shares in connection therewith, such rights may not be exercised in whole or in part unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.
          16.      The Employee agrees to notify in writing the Corporate Secretary of the Company of his intention, if any, to terminate his employment within ten days after said intention is formed.
          17.      Subject to any employment contract with the Employee, the terms of employment of the Employee shall be determined from time to time by the Company or the subsidiary employing the Employee, as the case may be, and the Company, or the subsidiary employing the Employee, as the case may be, shall have the right, which is hereby expressly reserved, to terminate the Employee or change the terms of the employment at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without good cause.
          18.      Whenever shares of Common Stock are to be issued to the Employee in satisfaction of the rights conferred hereby, the Company shall have the right to require the Employee to remit to the Company an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local withholding tax requirements prior to the delivery of any certificate or certificates for such shares.
          19.      The Committee shall have the power to interpret the Plan and this Agreement and to adopt such rules for the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan as are consistent therewith and to interpret or revoke any such rules. All actions taken and all interpretations and determinations made by the Committee in good faith shall be final and binding upon Employee, the Company and all other interested persons. No member of the Committee shall be personally liable for any action, determination or interpretation made in good faith with respect to the Plan or this Agreement.
          20.      In the event that any provision in this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severable from, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not be construed to have any effect on the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
 
          IN WITNESS HEREOF, the parties hereto have executed the Agreement, in duplicate, the day and year first above written.

Other Events.
In September 1999, a former employee of a subsidiary of ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against ABM in the state of Washington. On May 19, 2003, a Washington state court jury for the Spokane County Superior Court, in the case named awarded $4.0 million in damages to the plaintiff. The court later awarded costs of $0.7 million to the plaintiff, pre-judgment interest in the amount of $0.3 million and an additional $0.8 million to mitigate the federal tax impact of the plaintiff's award. ABM appealed the jury's verdict and the award of costs to the State Court of Appeals. On April 21, 2005, the Washington Court of Appeals denied ABM's appeal. ABM intends to appeal this ruling to the Washington State Supreme Court. ABM believes that the award against ABM was excessive and that the verdict was inconsistent with the law and the evidence. In the second quarter of 2005, ABM will record a charge of $6.3 million for the damages and costs awarded to the plaintiff including interest through April 30, 2005 and other court-awarded fees and costs associated with this judgment.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA, April 22, 2005  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM) announced today that it will take a charge of $6.3 million to establish a reserve in a gender discrimination case against one of its janitorial companies, American Building Maintenance Co.  West.
          ABM intends to appeal to the Washington State Supreme Court yesterday's ruling by the Washington Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals upheld a state court jury's award in 2003 to former employee Cheryl Forbes. In 2003, the same jury also returned a verdict in ABM's favor in the employment case of a second former employee.
          "We're disappointed with the court's ruling because the evidence demonstrated that Ms. Forbes was the company's highest-paid branch manager and had actually declined several opportunities for promotion," said Linda Auwers, ABM Senior Vice President and General Counsel.
          Ms. Auwers continued, "We take very seriously equal opportunities for women and providing all of our employees an inclusive and tolerant work environment in which they can fulfill their greatest potential. For many years, the company has had strong policies against harassment and discrimination, and these are being strengthened by ongoing efforts to maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace.
          "We are confident of our legal position and we will continue to work constructively to further enhance the working environment for all of our employees," Ms. Auwers concluded.
          ABM Industries Incorporated is among the largest facility services contractors listed on the New York Stock Exchange. With fiscal 2004 revenues in excess of $2.4 billion and more than 73,000 employees, ABM provides janitorial, parking, security, engineering, lighting and mechanical services for thousands of commercial, industrial, institutional and retail facilities in hundreds of cities across the United States and British Columbia, Canada.

Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On May 27, 2005, ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") entered into a Sale Agreement with Carrier Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of United Technologies Corporation ("Carrier"), to sell substantially all of the operating assets of its wholly owned subsidiary, CommAir Mechanical Services ("CommAir").
     The operating assets to be sold include customer contracts, accounts receivable, facility leases and other assets, as well as rights to the name "CommAir Mechanical Services." The consideration to be paid will be $32 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments, and assumption of trade payables and accrued liabilities. ABM expects to realize a pre-tax gain of approximately $21 million upon the closing of this transaction, which is anticipated to occur in June, 2005. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including the absence of material adverse developments in CommAir's business.
     As a result of this event, the assets and liabilities of CommAir will be segregated in ABM's consolidated financial statements and classified as held for sale, and the operating results and cash flows from CommAir will be reported as discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements of ABM commencing with the quarterly period ended April 30, 2005. Prior periods will also reflect this reclassification. CommAir generated pre-tax income for the year ended October 31, 2004, of $1.4 million on revenues of $41.1 million (which were 1.4% of ABM's consolidated pre-tax income before corporate expenses, and 1.7% of ABM's consolidated revenues).
     ABM expects to realize the gain from the sale of the CommAir assets in its third quarter of 2005.

Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 25, 2005 (the "effective time"), ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") terminated its $250 million three-year syndicated line of credit scheduled to expire on July 1, 2005 (the "old Facility") and replaced the old Facility with a new $300 million five-year syndicated line of credit scheduled to expire on May 25, 2010 (the "new Facility"). The new Facility was entered into among ABM, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender, L/C issuer and as a lender, KeyBank N.A., as syndication agent and as a lender, U.S. Bank N.A., as co-documentation agent and as a lender, BNP Paribas, as co-documentation agent and as a lender, and LaSalle Bank N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and Wachovia Bank, N.A., as lenders. The new Facility is available for working capital, the issuance of standby letters of credit, the financing of capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes.
Under the old Facility, no compensating balances were required and the interest rate was determined at the time of borrowing based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a spread of 0.875% to 1.50% or, for overnight borrowings, at the prime rate plus a spread of 0.00% to 0.25% or, for overnight to one week, at the Interbank Offered Rate ("IBOR") plus a spread of 0.875% to 1.50%. The spreads for LIBOR, prime and IBOR borrowings were based on ABM's leverage ratio. The old Facility called for a commitment fee payable quarterly, in arrears, of 0.175%, based on the average, daily, unused portion. For purposes of this calculation, irrevocable standby letters of credit issued primarily in conjunction with ABM's self-insurance program and cash borrowings were considered to be outstanding amounts.
Under the new Facility, no compensating balances are required and the interest rate is determined at the time of borrowing based on LIBOR plus a spread of 0.375% to 1.125% or, for overnight loan borrowings, at the prime rate or, for overnight to one week, at IBOR plus a spread of 0.375% to 1.125%. The spreads for LIBOR, prime and IBOR borrowings are based on ABM's leverage ratio. The new Facility calls for a non-use fee payable quarterly, in arrears, of 0.125%, based on the average, daily, unused portion. For purposes of this calculation, irrevocable standby letters of credit issued primarily in conjunction with ABM's self-insurance program and cash borrowings are considered to be outstanding amounts. As of April 30, 2005, the total outstanding amounts under the old Facility were $118.6 million, in the form of standby letters of credit; these standby letters of credit are now outstanding under the new Facility.
The new Facility includes usual and customary covenants for a credit facility of this type, including covenants limiting liens, dispositions, fundamental changes, investments, indebtedness, and certain transactions and payments. In addition, the new Facility also requires that ABM maintain three financial covenants: (1) a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.0 at fiscal quarter-end; (2) a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.0 at fiscal quarter-end; and (3) consolidated net worth greater than or equal to the sum of (i) $341,941,000, (ii) an amount equal to 50% of the consolidated net income earned in each full fiscal quarter ending after the effective time (with no deduction for a net loss in any such fiscal quarter) and (iii) an amount equal to 100% of
 
the aggregate increases in stockholders' equity of ABM and its subsidiaries after the effective time by reason of the issuance and sale of capital stock or other equity interests of ABM or any subsidiary, including upon any conversion of debt securities of ABM into such capital stock or other equity interests, but excluding by reason of the issuance and sale of capital stock pursuant to ABM's employee stock purchase plans, employee stock option plans and similar programs.
If an event of a default occurs under the new Facility, including certain cross-defaults, insolvency, change in control, and violation of specific covenants, among others, the lenders can restrict ABM's access to the new Facility or accelerate repayment of all amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, or require that ABM cash collateralize the outstanding letter of credit obligations.
The lenders and agents under the new Facility and their affiliates have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, lending, commercial banking, and other advisory services to ABM. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from ABM for such services. In addition, ABM and its subsidiaries provide facility services, including janitorial services, to certain of the lenders, their agents and affiliates for which it receives customary compensation. Such or additional services and payments may occur in the future.
Item 1.02  Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
The information set forth above in Item 1.01 regarding termination of ABM's prior $250 million credit facility as of May 25, 2005, is hereby incorporated by reference.

In that event, the fair market value, which will be used to determine the exercise price of the grant, will be the closing price of the Company's common stock as quoted in the composite transaction index for the New York Stock Exchange on the effective date as published in the "Wall Street Journal," or if no sale price was quoted in any such index on such date, then as of the next preceding date on which such a sale price was quoted. Prior plan definitions did not contemplate grants that were effective at a future date.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA  June 7, 2005 
"We're very pleased with the performance of our business," commented Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "Quarterly sales reached an all-time high for a second quarter and, exclusive of one-time items, net income was in line with previous guidance, despite higher costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance."
Slipsager continued, "The Company's sales grew due to contributions from acquisitions, new customers in all operating segments, and an expansion of services with existing Janitorial and Engineering customers. Our Parking, Security, Engineering and Lighting businesses posted double-digit growth in operating profits. Parking benefited from new contracts, improvement at airport locations due to increased air traffic across the country, and the termination of unprofitable contracts. Profit contributions from SSA, Sentinel, and Amguard acquisitions enabled Security to achieve year-over-year growth of 37.9% despite absorbing a pre-tax charge of $0.4 million for bad debt."
Quarterly income from continuing operations include a number of one-time items. As previously announced by the Company, the Janitorial operation recognized a $6.3 million pre-tax charge, or $3.8 million ($0.08 per diluted share) after-tax, for amounts awarded to the plaintiff in a discrimination lawsuit following the Company's loss on appeal. The Company has further appealed to the Washington Supreme Court. Substantially offsetting this charge, the Company recognized a $2.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) income tax benefit from the settlement of prior year state tax audits and recorded a $1.2 million pre-tax gain, or $0.7 million ($0.01 per diluted share) after-tax, related to indemnity payments received on the Company's World Trade Center insurance.
The second quarter of fiscal 2005 had one fewer workday than the comparable period in fiscal 2004, resulting in an after-tax benefit of $1.4 million ($0.03 per diluted share) on contracts with
 
variable labor cost but fixed monthly pricing. On a fiscal year-to-date basis, workdays were the same as the comparable prior year period.
The Company's income from continuing operations during the first six months of fiscal 2005 was $18.2 million ($0.36 per diluted share), up 35.4%, compared to $13.4 million ($0.28 per diluted share) for the same period last year. Sales and other income for the six months ended April 30, 2005 were $1.28 billion, up 11.8%, compared to $1.14 billion for the comparable period last year. Net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was $18.4 million ($0.36 per diluted share) up 34.8% compared to $13.7 million ($0.28 per diluted share) for the first half of 2004.
"ABM is focusing its financial and management resources on businesses that contribute to our position as a leader in the facility services industry," Mr. Slipsager continued. "Our financial position remains very strong. At the end of the second quarter, excluding the proceeds from the CommAir sale, the Company had over $52 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $246 million in working capital and no debt giving us the base to expand our existing operations by continuing to execute ABM's acquisition strategy."
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "Given the current economic climate, our operations are expected to continue to generally perform at or above our earlier forecasts. The time and costs associated with the initial certification of internal controls, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, is higher than anticipated. Reflecting continued operational strength and the previously mentioned third-quarter gain related to the sale of CommAir, we are increasing our fiscal 2005 guidance for net income to $1.17 to $1.23 per diluted share."

EXHIBIT 99.1
ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM), a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 was $21.7 million ($0.43 per diluted share), up 68.2%, compared to $12.9 million ($0.25 per diluted share) for the prior year third quarter. Sales and other income for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $650.1 million, up 6.1% from $612.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Net income for the quarter ended July 31, 2005, which included an after-tax gain of $14.2 million ($0.29 per diluted share) as a result of the previously announced sale of substantially all of the operating assets of CommAir Mechanical Services in the third quarter was $35.9 million ($0.72 per diluted share) compared to $13.1 million ($0.26 per diluted share) for the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  September 7, 2005 
"During the third quarter, we achieved record revenue and quarterly earnings above our previous guidance," commented Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "We experienced revenue and operating profit gains in our janitorial, parking, security and engineering segments due to contributions from acquisitions, new customers, and expansion of services with existing customers. In addition, we repurchased nearly 1.4 million shares of stock, bringing the fiscal year-to-date total to 1.6 million shares," he added.
"We successfully completed the sale of CommAir Mechanical Services during the third quarter, which highlights and reinforces ABM's strategy of focusing our financial and management resources on the businesses we are confident will grow and contribute to our position as a leading national service provider. We were also pleased with our handling of a labor dispute involving Service Employee union organizing in Houston, Texas. Despite work stoppages at various customer locations around the country, ABM was able to continue operations and provide uninterrupted service to its customers with no loss of business. The labor dispute relating to Houston has now been successfully resolved," he continued.
The 2005 actuarial report covering substantially all of the Company's self-insurance reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2005. The report showed favorable developments in the California workers' compensation and general liability claims, which required the Company to record in the third quarter of 2005 a $9.0 million pre-tax ($5.5 million after-tax or $0.11 per diluted share) benefit from the reduction of the Company's self-insurance reserve. Of the $9.0 million, $5.5 million ($3.5 million after-tax or $0.07 per diluted share) was attributable to reserves for 2004 and prior years, while $3.5 million ($2.2 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) was a reduction of the insurance provision for the six months of fiscal 2005. The $5.5 million ($3.5 million after-tax or $0.07 per diluted share) was recorded by Corporate, while the $3.5 million ($2.2 million after-tax or $0.04 per diluted share) was allocated to the operating segments.
Mr. Slipsager continued, "I am very pleased that through the efforts of our safety and insurance departments, and in coordination with our service operations, the safety programs we developed
 
and implemented have now resulted in a reduction of expenses associated with our California workers' compensation and general liability programs. These reductions will enable us to be more competitive going forward."
The Company's income from continuing operations during the first nine months of fiscal 2005 was $39.9 million ($0.79 per diluted share), up 51.5%, compared to $26.3 million ($0.53 per diluted share) for the same period last year. Sales and other income for the nine months ended July 31, 2005 were $1.93 billion, up 9.8%, compared to $1.76 billion for the comparable period last year. Net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was $54.3 million ($1.08 per diluted share) up 102.6% compared to $26.8 million ($0.54 per diluted share) for the first nine months of 2004.
"Given the current economic climate and our improving operational strength, we are increasing our fiscal 2005 guidance for net income from $1.36 to $1.40 per diluted share. This excludes acquisitions but includes the net effect of higher than anticipated costs related to the first year Sarbanes-Oxley 404 reporting and the expected fourth quarter gain from the sale of one of our parking leases," Slipsager concluded.
On Thursday, September 8, 2005 at 6:00 a.m. (PDT), ABM will host a live webcast of remarks by President and Chief Executive Officer Henrik C. Slipsager, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer George B. Sundby. The webcast will be accessible at www.irconnect.com/primecast/05/q3/abm_3q2005.html.

Item 1.01     
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On June 14, 2005, ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") and Henrik C. Slipsager, President & Chief Executive Officer of ABM entered into a new employment agreement. The new agreement has a term ending October 31, 2008. The terms of Mr. Slipsager's compensation are unchanged, with a base salary of $677,950 and a target bonus of 50% of base salary, which may range from 0% to 150% of the target based on Mr. Slipsager's performance. The performance criteria for fiscal 2005 are those reported in ABM's Form 8-K Current Report dated March 24, 2005. The remaining provisions of the agreement contain substantially the same terms and conditions as Mr. Slipsager's previous employment agreement, including non-competition, post-employment non-solicitation of customers and employees, and confidentiality with additional terms related to mutual non-disparagement, cooperation on litigation matters subsequent to termination, and revised terms related to the arbitration of any post-employment disputes.
On June 14, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") granted the following executive officers stock options under the 2002 Price-Vested Stock Option Plan to purchase the number of shares of the Company's common stock set forth beside each officer's name:
The exercise price for the shares under the June 14, 2005 grants is $18.30, the "Fair Market Value" of a share of the Company's common stock at the time of grant.

To the extent that accelerated vesting does not occur, the options will vest on June 14, 2013.

Exhibit 99.1
a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2005 of $15.2 million ($0.30 per diluted share), up 358.3%, compared to $3.3 million ($0.06 per diluted share) for the prior year fourth quarter. Sales and other income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were $658.7 million, up 6.3% from $619.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company recorded a $17.2 million or $10.5 million after-tax ($0.21 per diluted share) charge for adverse developments in the Company's California workers' compensation claims.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  December 14, 2005  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
"This was a strong quarter of revenue growth and profitability  with positive double-digit comparisons across all of our operating segments," commented Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "ABM's focus on our key strategic initiatives  combined with an improved economy and lower office vacancy rates  resulted in new business across the country.
"We're gaining momentum among all customer segments  commercial, industrial, institutional and retail facilities. Customers are increasingly attracted to the benefits of our bundled and integrated services, and the opportunity to contract multiple services from a single, leading national provider. In 2006, we expect to further leverage our customer value proposition through continued strategic acquisitions.
"In addition to our business success, our financial position remains very strong. We ended fiscal 2005 with approximately $64 million in cash and equivalents, no long-term debt and more than $257 million in working capital, and we generated $52 million in operating cash flow from continuing operations for fiscal 2005. For the first time in ABM's history, total assets exceeded $900 million."
Influences on Quarterly Results
The quarter ended October 31, 2005 included $4.3 million after-tax ($0.09 per diluted share) of higher professional fees related to initial compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley internal controls certification requirement which was substantially offset by $2.6 million after-tax gain ($0.05 per diluted share) for the sale of the leasehold interest for an off-airport parking facility and $1.6 million after-tax benefit ($0.03 per diluted share) from the reduction of 2004 and prior-year insurance reserves on three specialty risk programs.
The fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 had one more workday than the comparable period in fiscal 2004, resulting in an additional expense of $1.4 million after-tax ($0.03 per diluted share) on janitorial contracts with variable labor cost but fixed monthly pricing. On a fiscal year basis, 2005 also had one additional workday compared to 2004.
 
Full-Year 2005
The Company's income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was $55.1 million ($1.09 per diluted share), up 85.8%, compared to $29.6 million ($0.59 per diluted share) for fiscal 2004. Operating results for 2005 include $5.0 million of after tax benefits ($0.10 per diluted share) from prior year insurance reserve adjustments, a $2.7 million ($0.05 per diluted share) state income tax settlement and the fourth quarter parking leasehold gain. These benefits were substantially offset by the $7.0 million after-tax ($0.14 per diluted share) increase in Sarbanes-Oxley compliance professional fees and a $3.0 million after-tax ($0.06 per diluted share) settlement of former employee litigation.
Sales and other income for the year ended October 31, 2005 were $2.59 billion, up 8.9%, compared to $2.38 billion in 2004. Net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was $69.5 million ($1.38 per diluted share), up 127.9%, compared to $30.5 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for fiscal 2004. The Company realized an after-tax gain from the sale of its Mechanical Services subsidiary of $14.2 million ($0.29 per diluted share) in fiscal 2005.
2006 Guidance
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "Given the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow from continuing operations, we remain well positioned to continue to expand our existing lines of business in fiscal 2006 through a combination of acquisition and organic growth.
"Based on the current economic environment, our strong operational momentum and the recent increase in the level of sales activity, we expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 will be in the range of $1.08 to $1.14 per diluted share. This is exclusive of future acquisitions, and includes $0.06 of stock-based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R in fiscal 2006. Excluding 2006 stock based compensation and 2005 insurance and tax benefits related to prior years, we expect to increase income from operations by more than 20 percent."

ABM Industries, Inc. Linda S. Auwers (Senior Vice President and General Counsel) (415) 733-4000
San Francisco, CA  January 18, 2006  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM) today filed a Form 12b-25 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report that it anticipates filing by February 1, 2006 its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2005. The Annual Report was due January 17, 2006.
ABM has experienced unanticipated delays in completing the reconciliation of certain accounts affecting one of its operating units. These delays have in turn caused delays in completing the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 and management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting, the completion of which is a necessary prerequisite to the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year. The accounts in question are associated with a subsidiary acquired in the Company's Security segment in 2004.
The Company issued a preliminary earnings release on December 14, 2005 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005. In connection with the reconciliation of the accounts in question, the Company has determined that the estimates of cash and cash equivalents contained in this preliminary release will likely be reduced by approximately $6.8 million to approximately $57.2 million at October 31, 2005. The operating profit of the Security segment included in the preliminary numbers ($13.6 million in 2005) may require reduction. Any such reduction would reduce the net income from continuing operations and net income of the Company as a whole from the numbers cited for 2005 and above and in the preliminary earnings release, and may otherwise alter the amounts of other items included in the preliminary earnings release.

Item 2.02     Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On January 26, 2006, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release reporting anticipated adjustments to the preliminary fiscal year 2005 financial statements included in its December 14, 2005 press release. The January 26, 2006 press release is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated into this item by reference.
Item 4.02     Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
     In the Form 12b-25 filed by the Company on January 18, 2006, the Company reported that in the course of reconciling certain accounts associated with a business acquired in 2004 in the Security segment of the Company as part of the preparation of the Company's financial statements, it was determined that the amount of cash and cash equivalents at October 31, 2005 included in the Company's December 14, 2005 press release would likely be reduced.
     At the time that the Form 12b-25 was filed, the Company was not yet able to assess the specific impact of this likely reduction in cash and cash equivalents on the remaining information included in the December 14, 2005 press release. By January 20, 2006, the Company had completed procedures sufficient to determine that the financial information for fiscal year 2005 and the three months ended October 31, 2005 included in the December 14, 2005 press release, as well as the financial statements previously issued by the Company for the interim periods ended January 31, 2005, April 30, 2005 and July 31, 2005, should no longer be relied on.
     The procedures, which included a review of the financial statements of the acquired business, also identified errors involving payroll and payroll-related expenses and the accounting for a subcontracting arrangement with the sellers of the business while certain state operating licenses were being obtained by the Company. Based on the Company's investigation to date, the Company currently expects to make two adjustments to its preliminary fiscal year 2005 financial statements. The first anticipated adjustment is to decrease cash and cash equivalents at October 31, 2005 by approximately $7.0 million, to increase payroll and payroll-related expenses, which are included in operating expenses and cost of goods sold, by approximately $4.2 million for fiscal year 2005, and to record a receivable of approximately $2.8 million from the sellers of the business in prepaid and other current assets at October 31, 2005. The second anticipated adjustment is to increase both accrued compensation at October 31, 2005 and payroll and payroll-related expenses for fiscal year 2005 by approximately $3.0 million.
     The cumulative effect of these anticipated adjustments (on an after-tax basis) would be to reduce income from continuing operations and net income for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 by approximately $4.4 million, from $55.1 million to approximately $50.7 million in the case of income from continuing operations, and from $69.5 million to approximately $65.1 million in the case of net income. Finalization of these numbers and the impact on the individual quarters is subject to completion of reviews by management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Company also expects to revise fiscal year 2006 guidance.
 
     Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors have discussed the matters described above with the Company's independent accountant. The investigation of the matter has not been completed. While the information in this Form 8-K describes the material items for which the Company has determined adjustment will be required at this time, there can be no assurance that additional items will not be identified or the amounts of the adjustments will not be revised. The results, when finally determined, will be reflected in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2005, including the restatements of the financial statements for the interim periods ended January 31, 2005, April 30, 2005 and July 31, 2005. The Company does not believe it can complete all necessary procedures to enable this filing to occur by February 1, 2006, as originally anticipated in the Company's Form 12b-25.
     Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, beginning with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2005, management must furnish a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The procedures undertaken by the Company and described above revealed a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2005. The Company is in the process of designing improved internal control over financial reporting.
     
Forward Looking Statements:

The Company's actual results and assessment of internal control over financial reporting could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements in this report because of new information, future events or otherwise.

Exhibit 99.1
Contact: ABM Industries, Incorporated Linda S. Auwers (Senior Vice President and General Counsel) (415) 733-4000
ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM) today provided an update on the previously announced review of the financial statements of a Security business it had acquired in 2004. Based on its review to date, the Company has identified errors involving payroll and payroll-related expenses and the accounting for a subcontracting arrangement with the sellers of the business while certain state operating licenses were being obtained by the Company.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA, January 26, 2006 
Based on that review, ABM currently expects that adjustments to its preliminary fiscal year 2005 financial statements will reduce by approximately $4.4 million (on an after-tax basis) its preliminary net income and income from continuing operations, from those reported in its December 14, 2005 press release. The Company now expects fiscal year 2005 net income to approximate $65.1 million, and expects income from continuing operations to approximate $50.7 million. The Company also expects to revise fiscal year 2006 guidance.
Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president & chief executive officer, stated, "Make no mistake. We will provide investors with audited financial statements for 2005 as quickly as possible. But, let's not lose sight of these facts. First, despite these adjustments, ABM just turned in the best operating results in the Company's nearly 100-year history. Second, the issues at hand concern errors in the records at one operating unit we acquired less than two years ago. Third, our financial condition remains extremely robust. And, fourth, we continue to see strong momentum in the marketplace and are growing increasingly confident of our performance this year. This strength as well as a revised outlook for our security business and costs of the review will be reflected in our revised guidance."
ABM currently expects to make two adjustments to its preliminary fiscal year 2005 financial statements. The first anticipated adjustment is to decrease by approximately $7.0 million cash and cash equivalents at October 31, 2005, to increase payroll and payroll-related expenses (which are included in operating expenses and cost of goods sold) by approximately $4.2 million for fiscal year 2005, and to record a receivable of approximately $2.8 million from the sellers of the business in prepaid and other current assets at October 31, 2005. The second anticipated adjustment is to increase both accrued compensation at October 31, 2005, and payroll and payroll-related expenses for fiscal year 2005 by approximately $3.0 million.
 
Finalization of fiscal year 2005 results, which will include the restatement of the first three quarters, is subject to completion of reviews by management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
Additionally, the Company is in the process of designing improved internal control over financial reporting to remedy the material weakness revealed in this review. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, beginning with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2005, management must furnish a report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The Company's results when finalized will be reflected in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2005. At this time, the Company does not believe it can complete all necessary procedures to enable the filing of its Form 10-K for fiscal year 2005 by February 1, 2006.

The Company's actual results and assessment of internal control over financial reporting for fiscal year 2005 could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The final results reported by the Company will depend upon a number of factors, including the completion of the reviews and investigations that are underway, the occurrence of subsequent events that relate back to earlier periods and any other matters that arise in the process of completing the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. With respect to future results, any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These risks and uncertainties include: (1) a further delay in the filing of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and an adverse internal control evaluation under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that affects ABM's stock price; (2) a change in the frequency or severity of claims against the Company, a deterioration in claims management, or the cancellation or non-renewal of the Company's primary insurance policies; (3) a change in actuarial analysis that causes an unanticipated change in insurance reserves; (4) the loss of long-term customers; (5) intense
 
competition that lowers revenue or reduces margins; (6) labor disputes that lead to a loss of sales and expense variations; (7) acquisition activity slows or is unsuccessful; (8) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates lowers sales and profitability; (9) weakness in airline travel and the hospitality industry that affects the results of the Company's Parking segment; (10) financial difficulties or bankruptcy of a major customer; (11) an increase in costs that the Company cannot pass on to customers; (12) a significant increase in the Company's significant accounting and other control costs; (13) natural disasters or acts of terrorism that disrupt the Company in providing services; and (14) other issues and uncertainties that may include: new accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies, labor shortages that adversely affect the Company's ability to employ entry level personnel, legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally impacts the Company's expenses or reduces sales by adversely affecting the Company's customers such as state or locally mandated healthcare benefits, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, a reduction or revocation of the Company's line of credit that increases interest expense and the cost of capital, and the resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more of the Company's key executives that adversely affects customer retention or day-to-day management of the Company.

Item 1.01      Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
In 1998, a parking subsidiary of ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM) leased a parking facility in Houston, Texas, owned by a limited partnership jointly owned by affiliates of American National Insurance Company (ANICO) and partners associated with Gerry Albright (Albright affiliates). In June 2003, the ANICO affiliates notified the Albright affiliates that they would sell their interest in the parking facility. The Albright affiliates accepted the offer and attempted to secure financing. In connection with certain proposed financing for the Albright affiliates, ABM's parking subsidiary was asked to submit an estoppel certificate and on that certificate it set forth certain claims under the lease. The Albright affiliates subsequently did not close the transaction and the ANICO affiliates acquired the interest in the parking facility held by the Albright affiliates. On December 5, 2003, the Albright affiliates filed a lawsuit against ABM, its parking subsidiary, and certain ANICO affiliates. On February 15, 2006, ABM and the Albright affiliates entered into a settlement agreement following a court-ordered mediation. Under the settlement agreement, ABM will pay the Albright affiliates $6.25 million and the Albright affiliates will execute a release of ABM. ABM has notified its insurance carriers of the Albright claims, which carriers have denied coverage and refused to defend this litigation. In August 2005, ABM filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against its insurance carriers in Federal District Court in San Francisco, California to ensure its coverage for any damages related to the claims of the Albright affiliates. ABM continues to pursue this action against its insurance carriers and believes that its damages in the Albright case are covered by insurance. See Item 8.01 below.
Item 2.02      Results of Operations and Financial Condition
The response to this Item is incorporated by reference from Item 8.01 below.
Item 8.01      Other Events
On January 26, 2006, ABM issued a press release and filed a Form 8-K reporting, among other things, anticipated adjustments to the preliminary fiscal year 2005 financial results it had issued on December 14, 2005 and further delay in completing its fiscal year 2005 financial statements and, accordingly, its Form 10-K. Because ABM has not yet issued its financial statements for fiscal year 2005, charges related to its continuing resolution of lawsuits and other claims that relate to events occurring before October 31, 2005, such at as Albright litigation described in Item 1.01, will be recorded in fiscal year 2005. Including the Albright settlement, amounts attributable to resolution of such litigation and claims since December 14, 2005 aggregate approximately $7.8 million ($4.8 million after-tax) to be charged against fiscal year 2005. The forgoing amounts do not take into account recoveries, if any, from insurance carriers.
ABM is still in the process of finalizing its fiscal year 2005 financial statements and until that process is completed, its 2005 results of operations and other financial information may be impacted, as above, by the occurrence of subsequent events that relate back to an earlier period or by the identification of other matters that arise in the process of completing these financial statements and Form 10-K or its investigation of the matters that led to their delay, or by other events.

ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM), announced today that for the first quarter ended January 31, 2006, the Company now expects income from continuing operations will be approximately $0.07 per diluted share. For full-year 2006, the Company anticipates income from continuing operations will be in the range of $0.85 to $0.95 per diluted share.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  March 13, 2006 
The revised outlook for 2006 reflects lower than expected first quarter results, anticipated future losses from a security service business acquired in 2004 and second quarter 2006 professional fees associated with an ongoing independent investigation of accounting errors and related controls in the security segment conducted under the supervision of the Audit Committee of ABM's Board of Directors.
"With the exception of Security, our operating performance remains solid and so far this fiscal year we've seen revenue growth in our four largest operating segments," said Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "Our new guidance largely reflects a lower outlook in the Security service segment in 2006 and the second quarter 2006 costs associated with the Audit Committee's ongoing investigation of the recent accounting errors and related controls in the security segment.
"We're also reviewing programs to improve our financial control environment and help reduce the Company's audit and certification costs through centralized processes," Slipsager concluded.

     On March 29, 2006, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results related to the first quarter of fiscal year 2006. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated into this item by reference.

Exhibit 99.1
a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 was $4.0 million ($0.08 per diluted share) down 29.0% compared to $5.6 million ($0.11 per diluted share) for the prior year first quarter. Sales and other income for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 increased 4.5% to $666.6 million from $638.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  March 29, 2006  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
"First quarter performance on a consolidated basis was unsatisfactory," stated Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "Higher professional fees related to ABM's Sarbanes-Oxley compliance effort and our audit, as well as disappointing performance in our Security subsidiary, Security Services of America (SSA), adversely impacted our results by $0.07 per fully diluted share in comparison to our December forecast.
"Within the businesses, our largest segment, Janitorial, achieved strong 18.2% year-over-year increase in operating profit on top-line growth of 2.7%. Our Engineering segment experienced another quarter of solid revenue growth, posting a 15.3% increase over the same period last year. Operating profit for Engineering was up 6.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2005.
"During the quarter, we extended our geographic reach with the acquisition of Brandywine Building Services." Mr. Slipsager continued, "This strategic acquisition, with annual revenues of $9 million, added to our lines of manufacturing and specialty cleaning services, which is an area where we can leverage our expertise.
"We ended the quarter with $32 million in cash and cash equivalents, $245 million in working capital and no debt. Guidance for the second quarter is $0.19 to $0.23 per diluted share, which includes costs associated with the independent investigation conducted under the supervision of the Audit Committee. The second quarter has one less workday compared to the same period last year. For the fiscal year, the guidance remains as previously communicated, $0.85 to $0.95 per diluted share.
"I am pleased to announce that Maryellen Herringer has accepted the role of Chairman of the Board for ABM Industries. Maryellen has capably served on our board since 1993. I look forward to working closely with Maryellen in her new role."
Full-Year 2005
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "ABM has filed its Form 10-K for fiscal 2005. While I was disappointed with the delay in filing, I realize that in today's business environment, all necessary steps must be taken to ensure that the interests of stockholders are protected. I am pleased that the independent investigation conducted by ABM's Audit Committee substantiated senior management's initial conclusions. Now we can focus squarely on improving the profitability and internal controls of SSA and can continue to build upon the operational momentum achieved by our other service businesses."
 
The Company's income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was $43.6 million ($0.86 per diluted share), up 46.9%, compared to $29.6 million ($0.59 per diluted share) for fiscal 2004.
Sales and other income for the year ended October 31, 2005 were $2.59 billion, up 8.9%, compared to $2.38 billion in 2004. Net income, which includes income from discontinued operations, was $57.9 million ($1.15 per diluted share), up 90.0%, compared to $30.5 million ($0.61 per diluted share) for fiscal 2004. The Company realized an after-tax gain from the sale of its Mechanical services subsidiary of $14.2 million ($0.29 per diluted share) in fiscal 2005.

Item 1.01   Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On May 2, 2006, the shareholders of ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") approved the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Equity Plan"). The purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to provide stock-based compensation to employees and directors to promote close alignment among the interests of employees, directors and shareholders. Included in the 2006 Equity Plan are 2.5 million shares of the Company's common stock to be issued in accordance with the terms of the plan. In addition, the 2006 Equity Plan replaces the Time-Vested Incentive Stock Option Plan, the 1996 Price-Vested Performance Stock Option Plan, and the 2002 Price-Vested Performance Stock Option Plan, all in advance of their expirations, and the remaining shares authorized under these plans, plus forfeitures, will be available for grant under the 2006 Equity Plan. The terms and conditions governing existing grants under the Time-Vested Incentive Stock Option Plan, the 1996 Price-Vested Performance Stock Option Plan and the 2002 Price-Vested Performance Stock Option Plan will continue to apply to the outstanding grants made under those plans. The 2006 Equity Plan is an "omnibus" plan that provides for a variety of equity and equity-based award vehicles, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock unit awards, performance shares, and other share-based awards. Certain of the awards available under the 2006 Equity Plan will qualify as "performance-based" compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) ("Section 162(m)).
On May 2, 2006, the shareholders of the Company also approved the Executive Officer Incentive Plan. The purpose of the Executive Officer Incentive Plan is to provide annual performance-based cash incentives to certain employees of the Company and to motivate those employees to set and achieve above-average financial and non-financial goals. The Executive Officer Incentive Plan will give the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company the ability to award cash bonuses that qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m), and the Company's ability to deduct cash bonuses will be preserved. The aggregate fund available for bonuses under the Executive Officer Incentive Plan is three percent of pre-tax operating income for the award year. The plan sets forth certain limits on the awards to each of the covered employees eligible for bonuses under the Executive Officer Incentive Plan.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any one Share granted pursuant to a Full Value Award, 3.3 fewer Shares may be made subject to Awards to that Participant in that calendar year.
Number of Awards.
      The stock subject to Awards granted under the Plan shall be Shares of the Company's authorized but unissued or reacquired Common Stock.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any one Share issued in connection with a Full Value Award, 3.3 fewer Shares will be available for issuance in connection with future Awards. If any outstanding Option under the Plan or any outstanding stock option grant under the Prior Plans for any reason expires or is terminated or any Restricted Stock or Other Share-Based Award is forfeited and under the terms of the expired or terminated Award the Participant received no benefits of ownership during the period the Award was outstanding, then the Shares allocable to the unexercised portion of such Option or the forfeited Restricted Stock or Other Share-Based Award may again be subjected to Awards under the Plan. The following Shares may not again be made available for issuance under the Plan: Shares not issued or delivered as a result of the net exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right or Option and Shares used to pay the withholding taxes related to an Award.
      The limitations established by this Section 6 shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 18.
      Options granted to Employees and Directors pursuant to the Plan shall be evidenced by written Option Agreements in such form as the Administrator shall determine, subject to the following terms and conditions:
      (a)  Each Option shall state the number of Shares to which it pertains, which shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 18.
Number of Shares.
      (b)  Each Option shall state the Exercise Price, determined by the Administrator, which shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant, except as provided in Section 18.
Exercise Price.
      (c)  The Purchase Price shall be payable in full in United States dollars upon the exercise of the Option; provided that with the consent of the Administrator and in accordance with its rules and regulations, the Purchase Price may be paid by the surrender of Shares in good form for transfer, owned by the person exercising the Option and having a Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Purchase Price, or in any combination of cash and Shares, or in such acceptable form of payment as approved by the Administrator, so long as the total of the cash and the Fair Market Value of the Shares surrendered equals the Purchase Price. No Shares shall be issued until full payment has been made.
Medium and Time of Payment.
      (d)  Each Option shall state the date after which it shall cease to be exercisable. No Option shall be exercisable after the expiration of seven years from the date it is granted or such lesser period established by the Administrator. An Option shall, during a Participant's lifetime, be exercisable only by the Participant. No Option or any right granted thereunder shall be transferable by the Participant by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a Participant may designate a Beneficiary to succeed, after the Participant's death, to all of the Participant's Options outstanding on the
Term and Exercise of Options; Nontransferability of Options.
 
date of death; (ii) a Nonstatutory Stock Option or any right granted thereunder may be transferable pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined in the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; and (iii) any Participant may voluntarily transfer any Nonstatutory Stock Option to a Family Member as a gift or through a transfer to an entity in which more than 50% of the voting or beneficial interests are owned by Family Members (or the Participant) in exchange for an interest in that entity. In the event of any attempt by a Participant to alienate, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of an Option or of any right thereunder, except as provided herein, or in the event of the levy of any attachment, execution, or similar process upon the rights or interest hereby conferred, the Company at its election may terminate the affected Option by notice to the Participant and the Option shall thereupon become null and void.
      (e)  In the event that a Participant who is an Employee ceases to be employed by the Company or any of its Affiliates for any reason, such Participant (or in the case of death, such Participant's designated Beneficiary) shall have the right (subject to the limitation that no option may be exercised after its stated expiration date) to exercise the Option either:
Termination of Employment.
to the extent that, at the date of termination of employment, the Option had vested pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement with respect to which such Option was granted and had not previously been exercised. However, in addition to the rights and obligations established in Section 16 below, if the employment of a Participant is terminated by the Company or an Affiliate by reason of Cause, such Option shall cease to be exercisable at the time of the Participant's termination of employment. The Administrator (or its delegate) shall determine whether a Participant's employment is terminated by reason of Cause. In making such determination the Administrator (or its delegate) shall act fairly and shall give the Participant an opportunity to be heard and present evidence on his or her behalf. If a Participant's employment terminates for reasons other than Cause, but Cause is discovered after the termination and is determined to have occurred by the Administrator (or its delegate), all outstanding Options shall cease to be exercisable upon such determination.
      For purposes of this Section, the employment relationship will be treated as continuing while the Participant is on military leave, sick leave (including short term disability) or other bona fide leave of absence (to be determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator, in accordance with rules and regulations construing Code sections 422(a)(2) and 409A). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of an Incentive Stock Option, employment shall not be deemed to continue beyond three months after the Participant ceased active employment, unless the Participant's reemployment rights are guaranteed by statute or by contract. In the event that an Incentive Stock Option is exercised after the period following termination of employment that is required for qualification under Code section 422(b), such option shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock Option for all Plan purposes.
      In the event an Outside Director terminates service as a Director, the former Director (or his or her designated Beneficiary in the event of the Outside Director's death) shall have the right (subject to the limitation that no option may be exercised after its stated expiration date) to exercise the Option (to the extent vested pursuant to the terms of the Option Agreement and not previously exercised) within one year after such termination or on such other terms established by the Board in the Agreement or otherwise prior to termination of service.
      (f)  A Participant or a transferee of a Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by his or her Option until the date of issuance of a stock
Rights as a Shareholder.
 
certificate for such Shares. No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such stock certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 18.
      (g)  Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the Plan, including the limitations of Section 22, the Administrator may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options granted to Employees and Directors under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, no modification of an Option shall, without the consent of the Participant, alter or impair any rights or obligations under any Option previously granted under the Plan or cause any Option to fail to be exempt from the requirements of Code section 409A.
Modification, Extension and Renewal of Options.
      (h)  If and to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the date the Option is granted) of the Shares with respect to which any Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year under this Plan and all other plans maintained by the Company, its parent or its Subsidiaries exceeds $100,000, the excess (taking into account the order in which they were granted) shall be treated as Nonqualified Stock Options.
Limitation of Incentive Stock Option Awards.
      (i)  Options that provide for the automatic grant of another option upon exercise of the original option may not be granted under the Plan.
No Reload Options.
      (j)  The Option Agreement shall contain such other provisions that are consistent with the terms of the Plan, including, without limitation, restrictions upon the exercise of the Option, as the Administrator shall deem advisable.
Other Provisions.
      Stock Appreciation Rights granted to Participants pursuant to the Plan may be granted alone, in addition to, or in conjunction with, Options.
      (a)  Each Stock Appreciation Right shall state the number of Shares or Share Equivalents to which it pertains, which shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 18.
Number of Shares.
      (b)  The appreciation distribution payable on the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right will be equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate Fair Market Value (on the day before the date of exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right) of a number of Shares equal to the number of Shares or Share Equivalents in which the Participant is vested under such Stock Appreciation Right on such date, over (ii) the Exercise Price determined by the Administrator on the date of grant of the Stock Appreciation Right which shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant.
Calculation of Appreciation; Exercise Price.
      (c)  Each Stock Appreciation Right shall state the time or times when it may become exercisable. No Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable after the expiration of seven years from the date it is granted or such lesser period established by the Administrator.
Term and Exercise of Stock Appreciation Rights.
      (d)  The appreciation distribution in respect of a Stock Appreciation Right may be paid in Common Stock or in cash, or any combination of the two, or in any other form of consideration as determined by the Administrator and contained in the Stock Appreciation Right Agreement.
Payment.
      (e)  A Stock Appreciation Right shall, during a Participant's lifetime, be exercisable only by the Participant. No Stock Appreciation Right or any right granted thereunder shall be transferable by the Participant by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a Participant may designate a beneficiary to succeed, after the Participant's death, to all of the Participant's Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding on the date of death; (ii) a stand-alone Stock Appreciation Right or a Stock Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with a Nonstatutory Stock Option or any right granted thereunder may be transferable pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined in the Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; and (iii) any Participant may voluntarily transfer any stand-alone Stock Appreciation Right or a Stock Appreciation Right granted in conjunction with a Nonstatutory
Limitations on Transferability.
 
Stock Option to a Family Member as a gift or through a transfer to an entity in which more than 50% of the voting or beneficial interests are owned by Family Members (or the Participant) in exchange for an interest in that entity. In the event of any attempt by a Participant to alienate, assign, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise dispose of a Stock Appreciation Right or of any right thereunder, except as provided herein, or in the event of the levy of any attachment, execution, or similar process upon the rights or interest hereby conferred, the Company at its election may terminate the affected Stock Appreciation Right by notice to the Participant and the Stock Appreciation Right shall thereupon become null and void.
      (f)  Each Stock Appreciation Right Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right following termination of the Participant's employment or service with the Company and its Affiliates. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Administrator, need not be uniform among all Stock Appreciation Right Agreements entered into pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of employment.
Termination of Employment.
      (g)  A Participant or a transferee of a Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by his or her Stock Appreciation Right until the date of issuance of such Shares. Except as provided in Section 18, no adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such Shares are issued.
Rights as a Shareholder.
      (h)  The Stock Appreciation Right Agreement may contain such other terms and conditions, including restrictions or conditions on the vesting of the Stock Appreciation Right or the conditions under which the Stock Appreciation Right may be forfeited, as may be determined by the Administrator that are consistent with the Plan.

The Administrator may condition the grant of Restricted Stock upon the attainment of specified performance objectives established by the Administrator pursuant to Section 14 or such other factors as the Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion.
Grants.
      The terms of each Restricted Stock Award shall be set forth in a Restricted Stock Agreement between the Company and the Participant, which Agreement shall contain such provisions as the Administrator determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of the Plan. Each Participant receiving a Restricted Stock Award shall be issued a stock certificate in respect of such shares of Restricted Stock. Such certificate shall be registered in the name of such Participant, and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Award. The Administrator shall require that stock certificates evidencing such shares be held by the Company until the restrictions lapse and that, as a condition of any Restricted Stock Award, the Participant shall deliver to the Company a stock power relating to the stock covered by such Award. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, except with respect to a maximum of 5% of the shares authorized for issuance under Section 6, any Awards of Restricted Stock which vest on the basis of the Participant's length of service with the Company or its subsidiaries shall not provide for vesting that is any more rapid than annual pro rata vesting over a three-year period and any Awards of Restricted Stock which provide for vesting upon the attainment of performance goals shall provide for a performance period of at least 12 months.
 
      (b)  The shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this Section 9 shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:

      (a)  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Employees and Directors to whom, and the time or times at which, grants of Restricted Stock Units will be made, the number of Restricted Stock Units to be awarded, the price (if any) to be paid by the recipient of the Restricted Stock Units, the time or times within which such Restricted Stock Units may be subject to forfeiture, and all other terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock Unit Awards. The Administrator may condition the grant of Restricted Stock Unit Awards upon the attainment of specified performance objectives established by the Administrator pursuant to Section 14 or such other factors as the Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion.
Grants.
      The terms of each Restricted Stock Unit Award shall be set forth in a Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement between the Company and the Participant, which Agreement shall contain such provisions as the Administrator determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of the Plan. With respect to a Restricted Stock Unit Award, no certificate for shares of stock shall be issued at the time the grant is made (nor shall any book entry be made in the records of the Company) and the Participant shall have no right to or interest in shares of stock of the Company as a result of the grant of Restricted Stock Units.
      (b)  The Restricted Stock Units awarded pursuant to this Section 10 shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions:
Restrictions and Conditions.
 
      (c)  Each recipient of a Restricted Stock Unit Award may be eligible, subject to Administrator approval, to elect to defer all or a percentage of any Shares he or she may be entitled to receive upon the lapse of any restrictions or vesting period to which the Award is subject. This election shall be made by giving notice in a manner and within the time prescribed by the Administrator and in compliance with the requirements of Code section 409A. Each Participant must indicate the percentage (expressed in whole percentages) he or she elects to defer of any Shares he or she may be entitled to receive. If no notice is given, the Participant shall be deemed to have made no deferral election. Each deferral election filed with the Administrator shall become irrevocable on and after the prescribed deadline.
Deferral Election.
      (a)  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Employees and Directors to whom, and the time or times at which, grants of Performance Shares will be made, the number of Performance Shares to be awarded, the price (if any) to be paid by the recipient of the Performance Shares, the time or times within which such Performance Shares may be subject to forfeiture, and all other terms and conditions of the Performance Share Awards. The Administrator may condition the grant of Performance Share Awards upon the attainment of specified performance objectives established by the Administrator pursuant to Section 14 or such other factors as the Administrator may determine, in its sole discretion.
Grants.
      The terms of each Performance Share Award shall be set forth in a Performance Share Award Agreement between the Company and the Participant, which Agreement shall contain such provisions as the Administrator determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of the Plan. With respect to a Performance Share Award, no certificate for shares of stock shall be issued at the time the grant is made (nor shall any book entry be made in the records of the Company) and the Participant shall have no right to or interest in shares of stock of the Company as a result of the grant of Performance Shares.
      (b)  The Performance Shares awarded pursuant to this Section 11 shall be subject to the following restrictions and conditions: At the time of grant of a Performance Share Award, the Administrator may set performance objectives in its discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determined the number of Performance Shares that will be paid out to the Participant. The time period during which the performance objectives must be met will be called the "Performance Period." After the applicable Performance Period has ended, the recipient of the Performance Shares will be entitled to receive the number of Performance Shares earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a function of the extent to which the corresponding performance objectives have been achieved. After the grant of a Performance Share Award, the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objective for such Performance Share Award; provided, however, that no performance objective may be waved or reduced for a Covered Employee and further provided that no such action may alter the time of payment of the
Restrictions and Conditions.
 
Performance Share Award, if such alteration would cause the award to be subject to penalty under Code section 409A.
      (a)  Other Awards of Shares and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, Shares ("Other Share-Based Awards"), may be granted either alone or in addition to or in conjunction with other Awards under this Plan. Awards under this Section 12 may include (without limitation) Stock Rights, the grant of Shares conditioned upon some specified event, the payment of cash based upon the performance of the Shares or the grant of securities convertible into Shares.
Grants.
      Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have sole and complete authority to determine the Employees and Directors to whom and the time or times at which Other Share-Based Awards shall be made, the number of Shares or other securities, if any, to be granted pursuant to Other Share-Based Awards, and all other conditions of the Other Share-Based Awards. The Administrator may condition the grant of an Other Share-Based Award upon the attainment of specified performance goals or such other factors as the Administrator shall determine, in its sole discretion. In granting an Other Share-Based Award, the Administrator may determine that the recipient of an Other Share-Based Award shall be entitled to receive, currently or on a deferred basis, interest or dividends or dividend equivalents with respect to the Shares or other securities covered by the Award, and the Administrator may provide that such amounts (if any) shall be deemed to have been reinvested in additional Shares or otherwise reinvested. The terms of any Other Share-Based Award shall be set forth in an Other Share-Based Award Agreement between the Company and the Participant, which Agreement shall contain such provisions as the Administrator determines to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the intent of the Plan.
      (b)  In addition to the terms and conditions specified in the Other Share-Based Award Agreement, Other Share-Based Awards shall be subject to the following:
Terms and Conditions.
      Shares may be issued under this Plan to satisfy the payment of all or part of an award pursuant to the Company's annual bonus plan. In addition, all or part of any Director's fees may be paid in Shares or Share Equivalents issued under this Plan. Any Shares issued pursuant to this Section 13 shall reduce the number of Shares authorized under Section 6 but shall not be considered an Award for purposes of the maximum grant limitation in Section 5(b).
      (a)  The Administrator shall determine the terms and conditions of Awards at the date of grant or thereafter; provided that performance objectives for each year, if any, shall be established by the Administrator not later than the latest date permissible under Code section 162(m).
Authority to Establish.
      (b)  To the extent that such Awards are paid to Employees the performance objectives to be used, if any, shall be expressed in terms of one or more of the following: total shareholder return; earnings per share; stock price; return on equity; net earnings; income from continuing operations; related
Criteria.
 
return ratios; cash flow; net earnings growth; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA); gross or operating margins; productivity ratios; expense targets; operating efficiency; market share; customer satisfaction; working capital targets (including, but not limited to days sales outstanding); return on assets; increase in revenues; decrease in expenses; increase in funds from operations (FFO); and increase in FFO per share. Awards may be based on performance against objectives for more than one Subsidiary or segment of the Company. For example, awards for an Executive employed by the Company may be based on overall corporate performance against objectives, but awards for an Executive employed by a Subsidiary may be based on a combination of corporate, segment, and Subsidiary performance against objectives. Performance objectives, if any, established by the Administrator may be (but need not be) different from -year, and different performance objectives may be applicable to different Participants. Performance objectives may be determined on an absolute basis or relative to internal goals or relative to levels attained in prior years or related to other companies or indices or as ratios expressing relationships between two or more performance objectives. In addition, performance objectives may be based upon the attainment of specified levels of Company performance under one or more of the measures described above relative to the performance of other corporations.
year-to
      (c)  The Committee shall specify the manner of adjustment of any performance objectives to the extent necessary to prevent dilution or enlargement of any award as a result of extraordinary events or circumstances, as determined by the Committee, or to exclude the effects of extraordinary, unusual, or non-recurring items; changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles; currency fluctuations; discontinued operations; non-cash items, such as amortization, depreciation, or reserves; asset impairment; or any recapitalization, restructuring, reorganization, merger, acquisition, divestiture, consolidation, spin-off, split-up, combination, liquidation, dissolution, sale of assets, or other similar corporate transaction.
Adjustments.
      (a)  An Award may be subject to additional acceleration of vesting and exercisability upon or after a Change in Control as may be provided in the applicable Award Agreement and determined by the Administrator on a grant by grant basis or as may be provided in any other written agreement between the Company and any Affiliate or Subsidiary and the Participant; provided, however, that in the absence of such provision, no such acceleration shall occur and any such acceleration shall be subject to the limits set forth in Section 15(b).
Discretion to Accelerate.
      (b)  In connection with any acceleration of vesting or change in exercisability upon or after a Change in Control, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under an Award or under any other agreement between a Participant and Company would be an Excess Parachute Payment (including after taking into account the value, to the maximum extent permitted by Code section 280G, of covenants by or restrictions on Participant following the Change in Control), then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction will not be made if such reduction would result in Executive receiving an After-Tax Amount less than 90% of the After-Tax Amount of the severance payments he or she would have received under such Awards or any other agreement without regard to this limitation. Whether requested by a Participant or the Company, the determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits is required pursuant to the preceding sentence, and the value to be assigned to any covenants by or restrictions on Participant, for purposes of determining the amount, if any, of the Excess Parachute Payment will be made at the expense of the Company by the Company's independent accountants or benefits consultant.
Limitation on Acceleration.
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, if the Participant engages in conduct which constitutes Cause prior to, or during the twelve month period following, the exercise of the Option or the vesting of the Award, the Administrator (or its delegate) may
 
      (a) rescind the exercise of any Option exercised during the period beginning twelve months prior to through 24 months after the Participant's termination of employment or service with the Company or its Affiliates and cancel all outstanding Awards within 24 months after the Participant's termination of employment or service with the Company or its Affiliates, and
      (b) demand that the Participant pay over to the Company the proceeds (less the Participant's purchase price, if any) received by the Participant upon (i) the sale, transfer or other transaction involving the Shares acquired upon the exercise of any Option exercised during the period beginning twelve months prior to through 24 months after the Participant's termination of employment or service with the Company or its Affiliates or (ii) the vesting of any Award within twelve months prior to through 24 months after the Participant's termination of employment or service with the Company or its Affiliates, in such manner and on such terms and conditions as may be required, and, without limiting any other remedy the Company or its Affiliates may have, the Company shall be entitled to set-off against the amount of any such proceeds any amount owed the Participant by the Company or its Affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by law.
      Awards may be granted pursuant to the Plan until the termination of the Plan on January 10, 2016.
      Subject to any required action by the shareholders, the number of Shares covered by this Plan as provided in Section 6, the maximum grant limitation in Section 5(b), the number of Shares or Share Equivalents covered by or referenced in each outstanding Award, and the Exercise Price of each outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right and any price required to be paid for Restricted Stock or Other Share-Based Award shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a subdivision or consolidation of Shares, the payment of a stock dividend (but only of Common Stock) or any other increase or decrease in the number of such Shares effected without receipt of consideration by the Company or the declaration of a dividend payable in cash that has a material effect on the price of issued Shares.
      Subject to any required action by the shareholders, if the Company shall be a party to any merger, consolidation or other reorganization, each outstanding Award shall pertain and apply to the securities to which a holder of the number of Shares or Share Equivalents subject to the Award would have been entitled. In the event of a change in the Common Stock as presently constituted, which is limited to a change of all of its authorized shares with par value into the same number of shares with a different par value or without par value, the shares resulting from any such change shall be deemed to be the Common Stock within the meaning of the Plan.
      To the extent that the foregoing adjustments relate to stock or securities of the Company, such adjustments shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive, provided that each Incentive Stock Option granted pursuant to this Plan shall not be adjusted in a manner that causes the Option to fail to continue to qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Code section 422 or subject the Option to the requirements of Code section 409A.
      Except as expressly provided in this Section 18, a Participant shall have no rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class or the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class or by reason of any dissolution, liquidation, merger or consolidation or spin-off of assets or stock of another Company, and any issue by the Company of shares of stock of any class or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall not affect the number or price of Shares subject to the Option.
      The grant of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge or consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate, sell or transfer all or any part of its business assets.
 
      (a)  No Shares shall be issued pursuant to the Plan unless and until the Company has determined that: (i) it and the Participant have taken all actions required to register the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 or perfect an exemption from registration; (ii) any applicable listing requirement of any stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed has been satisfied; and (iii) any other applicable provision of state or federal law has been satisfied.
Securities Law.
      (b)  Neither the Plan nor any Award granted under the Plan shall be deemed to give any individual a right to remain employed by the Company or an Affiliate or to remain a Director. The Company and its Affiliates reserve the right to terminate the employment of any employee at any time, with or without cause or for no cause, subject only to a written employment contract (if any), and the Board reserves the right to terminate a Director's membership on the Board for cause in accordance with the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
Employment Rights.
      (c)  Except as provided by the Administrator in accordance with Section 10 or Section 12, a Participant shall have no dividend rights, voting rights or other rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by his or her Award prior to the issuance of a stock certificate for such Shares. No adjustment shall be made for cash dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date when such certificate is issued.
Shareholders' Rights.
      (d)  A holder of an Other Share-Based Award shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. An Other Share-Based Award shall represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Other Share-Based Award Agreement. An Other Share-Based Award shall not be deemed to create a trust for the benefit of any individual.
Creditors' Rights.
      Participants and their Beneficiaries may designate on the prescribed form one or more Beneficiaries to whom distribution shall be made of any Award outstanding at the time of the Participant's or Beneficiary's death. A Participant or Beneficiary may change such designation at any time by filing the prescribed form with the Administrator. If a Beneficiary has not been designated or if no designated Beneficiary survives the Participant or Beneficiary, distribution will be made to the residuary beneficiary under the terms of the Participant's or Beneficiary's last will and testament or, in the absence of a last will and testament, to the Participant's or Beneficiary's estate as Beneficiary.
      The Board may suspend or discontinue the Plan or revise or amend it with respect to any Shares at the time not subject to Awards except that, without approval of the shareholders of the Company, no such revision or amendment shall:
      (a) Increase the number of Shares subject to the Plan;
      (b) Change the designation in Section 5 of the class of Employees eligible to receive Awards;
      (c) Decrease the price at which Incentive Stock Options may be granted;
      (d) Remove the administration of the Plan from the Administrator; or
      (e) Amend this Section 21 to defeat its purpose.
      Without the consent of the shareholders of the Company, except as provided in Section 18, the Administrator shall have no authority to effect either (i) the repricing of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan or (ii) the cancellation of any outstanding Options or Stock
 
Appreciation Rights under the Plan and the grant in substitution therefor of new Options or Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan covering the same or different numbers of shares of Common Stock.
      The granting of an Option shall impose no obligation upon the Participant to exercise such Option.
      This Plan and any amendments requiring shareholder approval pursuant to Section 21 shall be subject to approval by affirmative vote of the shareholders of the Company. Such vote shall be taken at the first annual meeting of shareholders following the adoption of the Plan or of any such amendments, or any adjournment of such meeting.
      (a)  To the extent required by applicable law, the person exercising any Option granted under the Plan or the recipient of any payment or distribution under the Plan shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Company for the satisfaction of any applicable withholding tax obligations. The Company shall not be required to make such payment or distribution until such obligations are satisfied.
General.
      (b)  The Administrator may permit a Participant who exercises Nonqualified Stock Options or who vests in Restricted Stock Awards to satisfy all or part of his or her withholding tax obligations by having the Company withhold a portion of the Shares that otherwise would be issued to him or her under such Nonqualified Stock Options or Restricted Stock Awards. Such Shares shall be valued at the Fair Market Value on the day preceding the day when taxes otherwise would be withheld in cash. The payment of withholding taxes by surrendering Shares to the Company, if permitted by the Administrator, shall be subject to such restrictions as the Administrator may impose, including any restrictions required by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Other Awards.
      The Plan shall be binding upon the Company, its successors and assigns, and any parent Company of the Company's successors or assigns. Notwithstanding that the Plan may be binding upon a successor or assign by operation of law, the Company shall require any successor or assign to expressly assume and agree to be bound by the Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be if no succession or assignment had taken place.
      To record the adoption of the Plan effective January 10, 2006, the Company has caused its authorized officer to execute the same.

EXHIBIT 99.1
ABM Industries Announces Second Quarter Fiscal 2006 Financial Results
Tuesday June 6, 7:25 pm ET
Company Reiterates 2006 Fiscal Year Guidance
SAN FRANCISCO(BUSINESS WIRE)June 6, 2006ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM  News), a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 of $10.4 million ($0.21 per diluted share), up 17.5%, compared to $8.8 million ($0.17 per diluted share) for the prior year second quarter. Sales and other income for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were $660.1 million, up 3.2% from $639.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.
The second quarter of fiscal 2006 had one fewer workday than the comparable period in fiscal 2005, favorably impacting fixed-priced contracts by approximately $2.4 million. This benefit was offset by $2.4 million of professional fees for the recently completed Audit Committee's independent investigation of the prior year accounting at SSA, LLC, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of ABM Security.
"Substantially better than the year-before period, ABM's second quarter results demonstrate strength in our core business performance and success in recent acquisitions," commented Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "We continue to secure new business, and expand services to existing customers nationwide through effective deployment of management and financial resources. Our Janitorial and Engineering businesses have recently added new financial services customers and expanded services with existing high-tech clients. And we won a significant job from a major pharmaceutical company, further highlighting our specialty cleaning capabilities.
"Second quarter sales growth was driven by contributions from acquisitions completed in 2005 and the first half of 2006 and new business in Engineering and Security." Mr. Slipsager continued, "All operating segments showed improvements in operating income except Lighting. Although Lighting sales and profitability were disappointing, the backlog for this business increased dramatically and we believe Lighting will see improved performance in the coming months."
The Company's income from continuing operations during the first six months of fiscal 2006 was $14.4 million ($0.29 per diluted share), compared to $14.5 million ($0.28 per diluted share) for the same period last year. Sales and other income for the six months ended April 30, 2006 were $1.33 billion, up 3.8%, compared to $1.28 billion for the comparable period last year.
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "We repurchased eight hundred thousand shares during the quarter at a cost of $13.9 million. We ended the quarter with $25 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $242 million in working capital and no debt. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our existing lines of business in the second half of fiscal 2006 through organic growth and acquisitions. Guidance for the third quarter is $0.28 to $0.31 per diluted share. For full-year 2006, we continue to anticipate income from continuing operations will be in the range of $0.85 to $0.95 per diluted share."

EXHIBIT 99.1
a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of $17.3 million ($0.35 per diluted share), down 16.2%, compared to $20.6 million ($0.41 per diluted share) for the prior year third quarter. Sales and other income for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were $689.3 million, up 6.0% from $650.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  September 6, 2006  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
During the third quarter, we achieved record revenue and quarterly earnings above our previous guidance," commented Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "We delivered positive top-line comparisons across our janitorial, parking, security, engineering and lighting segments. Income from continuing operations for the quarter was solid. Our cash flow from operations was strong, generating $30 million for the quarter."
There were two items that specifically impacted the quarterly comparison for janitorial operations. The third quarter of fiscal 2006 included one more work day than the comparable period in fiscal 2005, unfavorably impacting janitorial fixed-price contracts by approximately $2.4 million pre-tax. In addition, a gender discrimination lawsuit was settled in the third quarter of 2005 for an amount lower than accrued, which increased income from continuing operations by $1.3 million pre-tax in that quarter.
The 2006 actuarial report covering substantially all of the Company's self-insurance reserves was completed in the third quarter of 2006. The report showed favorable developments in the Company's California workers' compensation and general and auto liability claims, offset in part by adverse development in the Company's workers' compensation claims outside of California, which resulted in a $7.9 million pre-tax reduction in the Company's self-insurance reserve in the third quarter of 2006. This reduction was $1.1 million less than the $9.0 million pre-tax reduction in self-insurance reserves recorded in the third quarter of 2005. Of the $7.9 million pre-tax benefit in 2006, $4.7 million pre-tax was recorded by Corporate while $3.2 million pre-tax was allocated to the operating segments.
The Company reported income from continuing operations during the nine months ended July 31, 2006 of $31.6 million ($0.64 per diluted share) on sales and other income of $2.0 billion, compared to $35.1 million ($0.69 per diluted share) on sales and other income of $1.9 billion for the same period last year. The 9.8% year-over-year decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the $2.6 million pre-tax of share-based compensation costs as a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R, and $2.4 million pre-tax of professional fees for the Audit Committee's independent investigation of the prior year accounting at SSA. Income from continuing operations in 2005 included a $5.0 million pre-tax litigation loss and a $3.4 million pre-tax charge for the amount the Company believes it overpaid SSA LLC, which reserve was reduced by $1.0 million pre-tax in the third quarter of 2006. Also included in 2005 was $2.7

million of income tax benefit resulting from a state tax audit settlement and $1.2 million pre-tax gain on the World Trade Center indemnity payment.
ABM's financial position remains very strong as the Company ended the quarter with $51.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, $261.8 million in working capital and no long term debt.
"Given the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow from continuing operations, we remain well positioned to expand our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth and to repurchase shares. We expect income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 will be in the range of $1.80 to $1.85 per diluted share, which includes approximately $45 million or $0.90 per diluted share for the settlement of the business interruption insurance claim related to the destruction of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. We are reviewing strategic investments in our information technology infrastructure. Should we decide to implement these programs and enhancements, there will be one-time costs that are not reflected in our guidance," Slipsager concluded.
On Thursday, September 7, 2006 at 6:00 a.m. (PDT), ABM will host a live webcast of remarks by President and Chief Executive Officer Henrik C. Slipsager, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer George B. Sundby. The webcast will be accessible at www.irconnect.com/primecast/06/q3/abm3q2006.html.

Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
Services Agreement with International Business Machines Corporation
On September 29, 2006, ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") entered into a Master Professional Services Agreement (the "Services Agreement") with International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") that became effective October 1, 2006, pursuant to which IBM will provide to the Company substantially all of the information technology infrastructure and services currently provided by in-house equipment and personnel. By transferring these functions to IBM, the Company expects to reduce the risks associated with performing these information technology functions in-house and upgrade the information technology infrastructure to support growth and strategic business initiatives.
The services that IBM will provide include data center, server, network and workstation operations, as well as help desk, applications management and support, and disaster recovery services. The base fee for these services will be more than $100 million over the initial term of 7 years and 3 months, and includes an existing network services contract with IBM that was made part of the Services Agreement. ABM and IBM may expand the services covered by the Service Agreement at rates set forth in the Services Agreement, or later agreed to by the parties, which would increase costs.
ABM has the right to extend the Services Agreement on the same terms and conditions for two additional 12-month periods. ABM has the right to terminate the Services Agreement at any time, with notice but without penalty, if IBM fails to timely cure a material breach of the Services Agreement or fails to meet specified service levels. ABM may also terminate the Services Agreement (or discontinue some of the services provided by IBM) at its convenience upon 6 months' notice and payment of a termination fee and wind down charges. The Services Agreement is terminable in certain other circumstances, including by ABM on changes of control of either ABM or IBM with notice and penalty.
As a result of the Services Agreement, 63 Company employees became employees of IBM effective September 30, 2006. There will be a transition period that will extend six months, during which period data will be transferred from the Company to IBM, equipment will be replaced and a facility will be closed, and that will involve some duplicate operations or other redundancies from time to time as well as some related costs.
 
.
Executive Compensation
On October 2, 2006, the Compensation Committee made equity compensation awards under ABM's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Equity Plan") to a number of senior executives, including James McClure, Executive Vice President and President, ABM Janitorial Services; Steven Zaccagnini; Executive Vice President and President, ABM Facility Services, and Linda S. Auwers, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. The awards to these individuals consist of nonqualified stock options restricted stock units, and performance shares as follows:
The nonqualified stock options have an exercise price of $18.71 per share, will vest as to 25% of the underlying shares on each of the next four anniversaries of the award and expire in 7 years. Restricted stock units will be settled in shares of ABM common stock (or in the case of restricted shares the restrictions will lapse) with respect to 50% of the underlying shares on the second anniversary of the award and 50% on the fourth anniversary of the award. Performance shares will consist of a contingent right to acquire shares of ABM common stock based on performance targets adopted by the Compensation Committee; in these awards the number of performance shares will vest based on gross margin and revenue targets for the two-year period beginning November 1, 2006 and ending October 31, 2008. Assuming minimums for both are met, vesting will occur within a range of 50% to 100% of the indicated shares depending on the combination of gross margin and revenue achieved.
Restricted stock units, restricted stock, and performance shares will be credited with dividend equivalents rights which will be converted to restricted stock units, restricted stock or performance shares, as applicable, at the fair market value of ABM common stock on the date of payment and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the underlying award.
In the event of a change of control of ABM, the awards will be governed by the terms of the severance agreements between each of these executives and ABM, except if a change in control occurs less than one year after the award date and the awards are not assumed by an acquirer, then the awards will vest only with respect to a number of shares based on the number of months between the award date and the date of the change in control divided by the number of months between the award date and the date on which the award would have fully vested. To the extent not vested, an award will terminate.
 
On October 2, 2006, the Compensation Committee adopted stock ownership guidelines for senior executives that are based on a multiple of base salary: Chief Executive Officer three times; Executive Vice Presidents, two times, and Senior Vice Presidents and certain subsidiary senior officers, one time. Executives are expected to achieve their targets within five years of becoming subject to the ownership guidelines. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors will periodically assess the guidelines and the officers' ownership relative to these guidelines, and make recommendations as appropriate. Progress toward targeted ownership levels may be taken into consideration in future grants to executives. In addition, executives who are not at their targeted stock ownership level must hold 50% of the net shares realized from any exercise of options or other unrestricted shares acquired under the Equity Plan for a minimum of one year.

Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that set forth anticipated results based on management's plans and assumptions. Such statements give the Company's current expectations or forecasts of future events and do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management tries, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as "expects," "believes" and similar expressions, and forward-looking statements include statements regarding the transition of responsibility for providing the Company's information technology infrastructure and related services to IBM, the timing and transition costs involved, future capabilities of IBM to satisfy the Company's requirements, the total costs of future services and any expected cost savings.
These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ include IBM's ability to provide information technology services to meet the Company's needs; the ability of IBM to maintain the security and integrity of Company data maintained by IBM as under the Services Agreement; the Company's and IBM's ability to effectively transition technology infrastructure operations on a timely basis and potential financial statement impacts of the transition, any of which could impact costs or expenses, and the effect of the IBM Agreement on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Other factors that could cause results to differ are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and filings on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. The information contained in this Form 8-K is based on information available to management as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

1.01     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On September 5, 2006, the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors approved the termination of the Director Retirement Plan for new directors and a plan to offer existing directors alternative benefits with respect to the value of their interests in the Director Retirement Plan.
On October 23, 2006, on recommendation of the Governance Committee, the Board adopted an unfunded Director Deferred Compensation Plan effective October 31, 2006. Directors may elect to convert their interests in the Director Retirement Plan to a Deferred Compensation Plan Account in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan (Deferred Compensation Account) or to Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). Under a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors on September 6, 2006, current directors who do not convert their interests in the Director Retirement Plan will not be eligible for the annual equity grants that are a component of non-employee director compensation.
Retirement plan benefits converted to Deferred Compensation Accounts will be credited with interest during the deferral period based on the prime rate up to six percent and if the prime rate exceeds six percent then at six percent plus one-half of the excess over six percent. Directors who elect to receive RSUs will be granted the number of RSUs under the ABM 2006 Equity Incentive Plan determined by dividing the amount of retirement benefits by the fair market value of ABM common stock on the date of the 2007 annual meeting of the shareholders of the Company. In the event of a director's termination of service prior to the 2007 annual meeting of shareholders on account of the director's death, disability or failure to be nominated to the Board of Directors for election at the 2007 annual meeting or a Change in Control, a director who elected RSUs shall be deemed to have converted his or her retirement benefits to a Deferred Compensation Account.
Directors who prior to November 1, 2007, voluntarily resign from the Board for any reason other than disability or a Change in Control will forfeit their RSUs or Deferred Compensation Account balance. Directors who stop serving on the Board after October 31, 2007, will receive a distribution of either (1) the RSUs (settled in ABM common stock) granted in connection with the termination of the director retirement plan or (2) their Deferred Compensation Account balance with respect to the converted retirement plan benefits, paid in a lump sum or over ten years as elected by the director. If a director dies, RSUs (settled in ABM common stock) or the Deferred Compensation Account balance will be distributed to the designated beneficiary.
The value of the benefits eligible for conversion to RSUs or a Deferred Compensation Account is calculated on the agreed upon accrued value of a director's retirement benefits at October 31, 2006, without taking into consideration a director's age or any benefits restrictions based on age or period of service. These values are $273,301 for each of Ms. Herringer and Messrs. Helms, Horngren, Kotkins, and Rosenberg. The values for Ms. Chavez and Messrs. Mandles and Steele are $255,081, $54,660, and $163,980 respectively.
 
1.02     Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
The Director Retirement Plan for each director electing to convert his or her interest in the plan into a Deferred Compensation Plan Account or RSUs will terminate on October 31, 2006. A description of such conversion is set forth in Item 1.01, which is by this reference incorporated herein.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of $61.6 million ($1.24 per diluted share), compared to $8.5 million ($0.17 per diluted share) for the prior year fourth quarter. As anticipated, results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year include $45.1 million ($0.91 per diluted share) from the settlement of the World Trade Center insurance claims. Sales and other income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were $696.7 million, up 5.8% from $658.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. When the Company's income from settlement of the World Trade Center insurance claims and unusual IT expenses are excluded, the Company's "Operating Earnings," a non-GAAP financial measure, for the fourth quarter of 2006 were $18.4 million ($0.37 per diluted share) as compared to $8.5 million ($0.17 per diluted share) in the same quarter of 2005.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  December 12, 2006  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
"We closed a strong year with solid revenue growth in the fourth quarter, improved margins in our Janitorial, Parking, Security and Engineering segments, and cash flow from operations of nearly $100 million due in large part to the successful resolution of our World Trade Center insurance claims," commented Henrik C. Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "Our focus and execution on key strategic initiatives continues to enhance our competitive position within the facility services industry. As our customers' requirements change we must respond by expanding our capabilities and enhancing our service platforms. ABM Engineering, which posted another quarter and year of double digit growth top and bottom line, exemplifies our effort to respond to market demands."
The Company reported income from continuing operations during the year ended October 31, 2006 of $93.2 million ($1.88 per diluted share) on sales and other income of $2.71 billion, compared to $43.6 million ($0.86 per diluted share) on sales and other income of $2.59 billion for last year. The increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the $45.1 million for the settlement of World Trade Center insurance claims and $3.6 million higher benefit from the reduction of the Company's self insurance reserves related to prior years' insurance claims. These improvements were partially offset by $2.6 million of share-based compensation costs as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R effective November 1, 2005, and $2.0 million charge related to the outsourcing of the Company's information technology infrastructure and services in October 2006. When the Company's income from the settlement of World Trade Center insurance claims and unusual IT expenses are excluded, operating earnings for fiscal year 2006 were $50.2 million ($1.01 per diluted share) compared with $42.8 million ($0.85 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2005.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 31, 2006 and applicable prior periods is included in the tables below titled: "Reconciliation of ABM's Operating Earnings with Income from Continuing Operations (GAAP)"

Earnings Guidance
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "In addition to our business success, our financial position remains very strong. We ended the year with $134.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, $312.5 million in working capital and no long term debt. For the first time in ABM's history, total assets exceeded $1 billion. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our cash flow from continuing operations, we remain well positioned to continue to expand our business through a combination of acquisitions and organic growth. We expect GAAP basis income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 will be in the range of $1.00 to $1.05 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect operating earnings for 2007 will be in the range of $1.10 to $1.15 per diluted share the difference being our IT outsourcing initiative."

To supplement ABM's consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, ABM uses operating earnings, a non-GAAP measure of income from continuing operations that excludes certain costs, expenses, gains or losses. These adjustments to ABM's GAAP income from continuing operations are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of this additional measure, in the aggregate and on a per-share basis, is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of net income prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On January 10, 2007, the Compensation Committee of ABM Industries Incorporated approved bonuses for executive officers and key employees under ABM's 2006 annual performance incentive program for executives and key employees. The Company Results component, based on certain targets for income from continuing operations ("Company Income") was modified to exclude the impact on income from continuing operations from the Company's settlement of litigation over its business interruption insurance coverage for its prior work in the World Trade Center, which lowered Company Income for purposes of payments under the program by $45.1 million. The Committee approved bonuses to James McClure, Executive Vice President & President, ABM Janitorial, George Sundby, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steven Zaccagnini, Executive Vice President, and Linda Auwers, Senior Vice President & General Counsel, in accordance with the terms of the 2006 Executive Officer Incentive Plan and the 2006 annual incentive program. In addition, the Compensation Committee approved one-time bonuses of $93,516 to Mr. Sundby for his achievements in improving the ABM control environment and $18,834 to Ms. Auwers for her successful management of the Company's World Trade Center insurance litigation.
At the January 10, 2007, meeting, the Committee also reviewed the base compensation and target bonuses for Messrs. McClure, Zaccagnini, and Sundby and Ms. Auwers, evaluating current duties and responsibilities and comparative compensation information with the Committee's independent compensation consultant. Following the review, the Committee increased the base compensation of Mr. McClure to $450,000, Mr. Zaccagnini to $420,000, Mr. Sundby to $360,000, and Ms. Auwers to $325,000. In addition, the Committee increased Mr. McClure's target bonus to 65% and Mr. Zaccagnini's target bonus to 55%. Each of these compensation changes was retroactive to November 1, 2006. The bonus targets for Mr. Sundby and Ms. Auwers remain at 50% and 40% respectively. The 2007 annual performance incentive program, which will set forth the criteria for determining if bonus payments to these executives as well as other executives and key employees will be more or less than target bonus amounts, has not yet been approved.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01   .
Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
On January 22, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") adopted performance objectives for its 2007 fiscal year, which ends October 31, 2007, for Henrik C. Slipsager, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. The objectives were reviewed and ratified by the Board of Directors (without Mr. Slipsager's participation) on January 23, 2007. Mr. Slipsager's employment agreement calls for a bonus based upon his performance measured against performance objectives adopted by the Compensation Committee. The 2007 performance objectives are attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 8-K.
On January 25, 2007, the Compensation Committee authorized the grant to a number of employees, including Mr. Slipsager, of equity awards of a specified value, which such grants the Committee anticipates will be effective in March 2007. The aggregate value authorized for Mr. Slipsager was $1,120,000, which value will be divided equally among restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance shares and nonqualified stock options based on the fair market value of ABM common stock two days after the filing of ABM's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2007. The vesting of the performance shares is tied to three-year profit margin and revenue targets in the period ended October 31, 2009. In addition, the Committee approved grants to 73 other employees that will be effective on the same date and that will have an aggregate value of $1,394,686, of which 5% of the value will be in nonqualified stock options, 15% in performance shares, and 80% in RSUs.
On January 27, 2007, the independent directors of the Board of Directors approved an increase in Mr. Slipsager's target bonus for 2007 to 80 percent of his base pay. The bonus may range from 0 to 150 percent of the target amount based on Mr. Slipsager's performance against the performance objectives. Mr. Slipsager's base pay of $700,000 is unchanged.
On January 25, 2007, the Board of Directors approved the 2007 annual performance incentive program for executives and key employees, including James McClure, Executive Vice President of ABM and President, ABM Janitorial Services, George Sundby, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Steven Zaccagnini, Executive Vice President & President, ABM Facility Services, and Linda Auwers, Senior Vice President & General Counsel. The annual performance incentive program sets forth the criteria for determining if bonus payments to these executives, as well as other executives and key employees, will be more or less than target bonus amounts.
Mr. Sundby's 2007 target bonus is 50 percent of base pay. His bonus will be based 60 percent on Company performance ("Company Results") and 40 percent on his individual performance in providing strategic leadership, employee leadership, and compliance and administration ("Individual Performance"). The Company Results component of the bonus may range from zero to 200 percent of the target amount of 30 percent of Mr. Sundby's base pay. The Company Results component is based on certain targets for income from continuing operations ("Company Income") subject to discretionary strategic results modifiers ("Strategic Results Modifiers"). The Company Results bonus is subject to the achievement of a threshold Company Income amount. The performance metrics for the Strategic Results Modifiers include revenue growth, operating profit margins, cash flow, cost reduction and other strategic performance targets. The Individual Performance component of the bonus may range from 0 to 150 percent of the target amount of 20 percent of Mr. Sundby's base pay.
 
Mr. McClure's 2007 target bonus is 65 percent of base pay. His bonus will be based 20 percent on Company Results, 40 percent on the operational performance of the Company's janitorial subsidiaries ("Janitorial Results"), and 40 percent on Individual Performance. With respect to the Company Results and Individual Performance components, the payment and goals correspond to Mr. Sundby's other than the target amount for the Company Results bonus component is 13 percent of Mr. McClure's base pay and the target amount for the Individual Performance component is 26 percent of Mr. McClure's base pay. The Janitorial Results component of the bonus may range from zero to 200 percent of the target amount of 26 percent of Mr. McClure's base pay. The Janitorial Results component is based on the Company's janitorial subsidiaries achieving certain pre-tax net income targets ("Janitorial Income") subject to a strategic results modifier based upon achievement of certain days sales outstanding targets. The Janitorial Results component is subject to achievement of a threshold amount of Janitorial Income.
Mr. Zaccagnini's 2007 target bonus is 55 percent of base pay. His bonus will be based on the same criteria as Mr. McClure's except the operations component of his bonus will reflect certain pre-tax net income targets for the Company's Engineering, Parking, Lighting and Security subsidiaries and be subject to achievement of threshold amounts of pre-tax net income with respect to each of these businesses.
Ms. Auwers's 2007 target bonus is 40 percent of base pay. Her bonus will be based 50 percent on Company Results, 20 percent on functional performance ("Functional Performance"), and 30 percent on Individual Performance. With respect to the Company Results and Individual Performance components, the payment and goals correspond to Mr. Sundby other than the target amount for the Company Results bonus component is 20 percent of Ms. Auwers's base pay and the target amount for the Individual Performance component is 12 percent of Ms. Auwers's base pay. The Functional Performance component of Ms. Auwers's bonus will be based on the performance of the Legal Department that she heads in meeting its major objectives for the year and may range from 0 to 150 percent of the target amount of 8 percent of her base pay.
Mr. Slipsager is not included in the 2007 annual performance incentive plan, although his 2007 performance objectives reflect a number of similar objectives. The Compensation Committee may also decide to pay bonuses outside the annual performance incentive program.

EXHIBIT 99.1
, a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 of $8.7 million ($0.18 per diluted share), up 118.1%, compared to $4.0 million ($0.08 per diluted share) for the prior year first quarter. Sales and other income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were $703.5 million, up 5.5% from $666.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
SAN FRANCISCO, CA  March 5, 2007  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
Net income of $8.7 million for first quarter of 2007 included a net after-tax benefit of approximately $0.5 million ($0.01 per diluted share) comprised of a $4.2 million ($2.5 million after-tax) benefit from the reduction of the Company's self insurance reserves related to prior years' insurance claims that was partially offset by $2.0 million ($1.2 million after-tax) of additional share-based compensation expense due to the acceleration of price vested employee stock options and a $1.4 million ($0.8 million after-tax) litigation-related contingent loss provision. The first quarter of 2006 included an additional $3.0 million ($1.8 million after-tax) of professional fees related to the Sarbanes-Oxley internal controls certification requirement compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
"ABM's strong first quarter performance reflects the demand for our high quality building services and is evidence of the hard work and dedication of our entire organization," commented Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "All business segments showed top-line growth due to a combination of sales from new customers and expanded services for existing customers, and operating profits improved in our janitorial, parking, security and lighting operations. Janitorial had an outstanding quarter as they continued to experience growth in both tag work and owner-occupied sales. Our Parking business benefited from higher lease and fixed allowance revenues and, as anticipated, our Lighting business was driven by the backlog for special projects."
Mr. Slipsager continued, "We ended the first quarter with approximately $91 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $324 million in working capital and no debt. Based on our strong balance sheet and sound strategy, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to expand our existing lines of business in fiscal 2007 through organic growth and acquisitions. We continue to focus on expanding our new business and are committed to using our financial and management resources to further our position as a leading national service provider."
 
The Company expects net income for the second quarter to be $0.28 to $0.32 per diluted share, including a pre-tax gain of approximately $5 million on the sale of one of the Company's off-airport parking leases and a pre-tax expense of $1.9 million from the vesting of additional price-vested employee stock options. The Company is increasing its fiscal 2007 guidance of net income to $1.04 to $1.08 per diluted share on a GAAP-basis and in the range of $1.12 to $1.16 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, the difference being the additional expenses for certain costs associated with the Company's implementation of new IT systems.
Guidance
A reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings guidance for Q1 and the remainder of the fiscal year ending October 31, 2007 is included in the tables below titled: "Reconciliation of Consolidated GAAP to Consolidated Non-GAAP."
References by the Company to non-GAAP income and non-GAAP earnings per share refer to net income or earnings per share excluding the effect of certain costs associated with the Company's investment in information technology systems. Non-GAAP net income (which is the basis for non-GAAP earnings per share) gives an indication of ABM's baseline performance before this cost, which the Company considers to be outside the Company's ongoing operating results. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures will aid investors' overall understanding of the Company's results by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain expenses, through providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how the Company plans and measures its own business. However, the presentation of non-GAAP measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with GAAP.
On Tuesday, March 6, 2007 at 6:00 a.m. (PST), ABM will host a live webcast of remarks by President and Chief Executive Officer Henrik C. Slipsager, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer George B. Sundby. The webcast will be accessible at .

In the March 12, 2007 press release discussed below in Item 8.01, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") announced that effective March 19, 2007, James Lusk will become its new Executive Vice President. Effective December 31, 2007, Mr. Lusk will succeed George B. Sundby as Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer.
Mr. Lusk, 51, was Vice President, Business Services & Chief Operating Officer for the Europe, Middle East and Africa regions for Avaya from January 2005 to January 2007. From October 2002 to January 2005 he was Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Bioscrip/MIM Corporation. From January 2002 until October 2002 Mr. Lusk was the Chief Executive Officer of Sevmir Enterprises, a financial services company which he founded. Prior to that, Mr. Lusk spent nineteen years in various positions at Lucent Technologies/AT&T, including President of Business Services and Interim CFO. He serves on the Board of Directors of Glowpoint, Inc.
The Compensation Committee has approved Mr. Lusk's compensation, which for the remainder of fiscal year 2007 will be at an annual salary rate of $420,000 with a 2007 incentive bonus of $231,000. In fiscal year 2008, Mr. Lusk will begin to participate in the Company's annual performance incentive program, under which he will be eligible for bonus payments based on the same criteria as other senior executives.
The Compensation Committee also authorized the grant to Mr. Lusk of equity awards with the aggregate value of $650,000, which value will be divided $275,000 in restricted stock units ("RSUs"), $250,000 in performance shares and the remaining $125,000 in nonqualified stock options based on the fair market value of ABM common stock on the effective date of Mr. Lusk's employment, which the Company expects to be March 19, 2007. The vesting of the performance shares is tied to two-year profit margin and revenue targets in the period ending October 31, 2009.
The Company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Lusk that would extend through March 2009, and would further extend automatically for an additional one-year period if a notice of non-renewal is not given at least 90 days prior to the termination date. The employment agreement would also terminate earlier in connection with termination for cause, voluntary termination by Mr. Lusk or upon his total disability or death.
Under the employment agreement, Mr. Lusk would also eligible for other customary benefits including, but not limited to, participation in the Company's 401(k) Plan, as well as group life, health, and accidental death and disability insurance programs. Under Company policies, the Company also provides certain other perquisites, such as automobiles or automobile allowances and expenses, club dues, and incidental personal benefits, including office parking.
 
The Company expects to enter into a severance agreement with Mr. Lusk, similar to those of current top senior management, should his employment with the Company be terminated under certain defined circumstances following a change in control. The agreements are considered to be "double trigger" arrangements where the payment of severance compensation is predicated upon the occurrence of two triggering events: (1) the occurrence of a change in control; and (2) either the involuntary termination of employment with the Company (other than for "cause" as defined in the agreement) or the termination of employment with the Company for "good reason" as defined in the agreement. The stated benefits consist of (1) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to two times the sum of base salary (at the rate in effect for the year in which the termination date occurs) and current target bonus; (2) the continuation of all health benefits or reasonably equivalent benefits for 18 months following the date of termination; and (3) a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of any unpaid incentive compensation that was earned, accrued, allocated or awarded for a performance period ending prior to the termination date plus the value of any annual bonus or long-term incentive pay earned, accrued, allocated or awarded with respect to service during the performance period. Any payments under the severance agreement will be reduced to the extent that the executive receives payment under his employment agreement with the Company following a termination of employment.
Payments and benefits under the Company's severance agreements (as well as under all other agreements or plans covering an executive) are subject to reduction in order to avoid the application of the excise tax on "excess parachute payments" under the Internal Revenue Code, but only if the reduction would increase the net after-tax amount received by the named executive officer (the "modified cap") with one exception. The exception is that the reduction may be made to the extent the executive would be entitled to receive, on a net-after tax basis, at least 90% of the severance payment he would otherwise be entitled to under the severance agreement. In consideration for the protection afforded by the severance agreements, the executive agrees to non-competition provisions for the term of employment and for varying periods of time thereafter.
In connection with the transition, the existing employment agreement of Mr. Sundby has been amended, and extended from its current termination date of October 31, 2007 to December 31, 2007, at an annual salary rate of $360,000 and a fiscal year 2007 incentive bonus equal to 50% of his salary. He is entitled to an additional bonus of $100,000 on timely filing of the Company's 2007 Form 10-K and effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. At the time the employment agreement ends, Mr. Sundby will also be entitled to receive a severance payment of $540,000 and reimbursement for the cost of certain continuing health insurance benefits. (He will not receive these payments on any earlier voluntary termination.) To the extent Mr. Sundby provides consulting services after December 31, 2007, he will receive $300 per hour.
 
In a March 12, 2007 press release, the Company announced that it was establishing a Shared Services center in Houston, Texas, to consolidate certain back office operations; it also announced that it would locate its ABM Janitorial headquarters in Houston, concentrate its other business units in southern California and, in 2008, relocate its executive headquarters to New York City. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 and is by this reference incorporated herein.

99.1 Press Released dated March 12, 2007, announcing a strategic repositioning and the appointment of James Lusk as Executive Vice President.

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
 ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM), a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today announced a series of operational and leadership initiatives reinforcing the Company's commitment to increasing shareholder value and establishing a platform supporting significant long-term growth.
SAN FRANCISCO  March 12, 2007
Central to the initiatives is the establishment of a Shared Services center consolidating certain of the Company's back office functions in Houston, Texas. By integrating support functions, the new Shared Services unit will increase operating efficiencies and enhance the Company's competitive position within the industry. It also represents an extension of ABM's ongoing strategy to invest in its technology infrastructure.
James Lusk, an executive with experience directing implementation of a Shared Services unit at other companies, is joining ABM this month as Executive Vice President. Initially, Mr. Lusk will head the Shared Services implementation and effective December 31, 2007, he will succeed George B. Sundby as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
In addition: the Company will locate its ABM Janitorial headquarters in Houston; its other business units will be concentrated in southern California; and, in 2008, its executive headquarters will locate in New York City.
"ABM is at an exciting juncture," said ABM President and Chief Executive Officer Henrik Slipsager. "Building on our current momentum to position the Company to best meet both market dynamics and customer-driven demands, we are re-positioning the Company for competitiveness and expansion. By consolidating back office functions in a Shared Services center in Houston, concentrating our non-Janitorial operational units in southern California, and re-tooling our management organization  including locating our executive headquarters in New York closer to many of our major customers  we will gain operating efficiencies and be able to capitalize on growth opportunities. These actions are not expected to have a material impact on previously issued earnings guidance.
"Jim Lusk brings a wealth of experience to help us achieve these new initiatives. He is a recognized thought leader in the area of corporate Shared Services and has implemented these types of programs successfully for other companies. Given ABM's evolution, Jim is exactly the type of executive we'll need to succeed in the next phase of our growth  a strategic adviser to the CEO and a partner to the business unit management.
 
"I'd like to thank George Sundby for his many contributions to ABM. George has played a substantial role in establishing ABM as an industry leader. In particular, I'd like to recognize his efforts in enhancing our finance and control environment and leading the Company's response to Sarbanes-Oxley. We appreciate his willingness to continue serving the Company through the end of the year and his commitment to ensure a smooth transition. Understanding that he's not prepared to relocate at this point, we wish George much success in his future endeavors."
Lusk Named EVP; Will Succeed Sundby as CFO at Year-End
Mr. Lusk, most recently served as Avaya's Vice President, Business Services & Chief Operating Officer for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. He is a member of the Board of Directors of Glowpoint, Inc., serving on the Audit and Compensation Committees.
Among his prior positions, Mr. Lusk served as President, Business Services and acting Chief Financial Officer at Lucent Technologies. During his tenure there, Mr. Lusk created and launched Lucent Financial Services, which provided high volume/low cost accounting and financial transaction processing to Lucent. In conjunction with PricewaterhouseCoopers, Mr. Lusk also coauthored the book "Shared Services  Adding Value to the Business Units."
He has also served as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Bioscrip/MIM Corporation, and has held positions at AT&T Corporation, Amerada Hess, Children's Hospital and Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co. Mr. Lusk holds an MBA in Finance from Seton Hall University and a BS in Economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is a CPA and was inducted into the AICPA Business and Industry Leadership Hall of Fame in 1999.
Effective December 31, 2007, Mr. Lusk will succeed George B. Sundby as ABM's Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer.
ABM Janitorial to Houston, ABM Facility Services to Southern California
As part of the new initiative, the Company will locate the headquarters of its ABM Janitorial business unit from San Francisco to Houston in 2008. The Company will retain the current regional locations of its Janitorial business, including the Northern California region based in San Francisco.
 
The Company's other business units  including AMPCO Parking, ABM Security Services, ABM Facility Services, ABM Engineering and Amtech Lighting Services  will be headquartered in southern California. As with Janitorial, the Company will retain the current regional locations of those business units.
Executive Headquarters to New York

, a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 of $16.7 million ($0.33 per diluted share), up 60.9%, compared to $10.4 million ($0.21 per diluted share) for the prior year second quarter.
SAN FRANCISCOJune 5, 2007ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
Sales and other income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 were $697.9 million, up 5.7% from $660.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
"We are very pleased with our second quarter financial performance, which was at the high end of our expectations," commented Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "Our focus on key strategic initiatives resulted in new business and the expansion of services to existing customers across the country. We experienced an increase in sales across all of our segments and achieved an organic growth rate of 4.6% for the second quarter of 2007. During the quarter, we also purchased the assets of HealthCare Parking Systems of America (HPSA), which provides an important and strategic expansion into the growing healthcare segment of the parking industry."
Mr. Slipsager continued, "Despite a $7.1 million cash outlay for HPSA, we ended the second quarter with approximately $99 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $345 million in working capital and no debt. In addition to our strong financial position, our breadth of services and talented pool of employees are the main drivers for our continued growth and we believe that these aspects of our business have positioned ABM to continue to expand its leadership position in facility services. In addition, in fiscal 2007, we are taking actions to increase operating efficiencies, including the establishment of a Shared Services Center consolidating certain back office functions in Houston, Texas."
The net income of $16.7 million for second quarter of 2007, which as previously announced, includes a $5.0 million ($3.0 million after-tax) gain from the sale of an airport parking garage lease, partially offset by $1.9 million ($1.2 million after-tax) of additional share-based compensation expense due to the acceleration of price vested employee stock options. The second quarter of 2006 included an additional $2.4 million ($1.5 million after-tax) of professional fees for the Audit Committee's independent investigation of 2005 accounting at Security Services of America (SSA), a Company subsidiary.
 
The Company reported net income during the six months ended April 30, 2007 of $25.4 million ($0.51 per diluted share) on sales of $1.4 billion, compared to $14.4 million ($0.29 per diluted share) on sales of $1.3 billion for the same period last year.
The Company expects net income for the third quarter to be $0.25 to $0.29 per diluted share. The Company's net income for the third quarter of 2006 of $0.35 per diluted share included $7.9 million ($4.8 million after-tax or $0.10 per diluted share) of favorable development to the beginning of the period insurance reserves. The Company is increasing its fiscal 2007 guidance of net income to $1.05 to $1.10 per diluted share, which includes a $0.02 per diluted share impact from the increase in shares outstanding as a result of recent exercises of employee stock options and $0.03 per diluted share for certain costs associated with the Company's implementation of new IT systems.

     On September 5, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, payable on November 5, 2007 to stockholders of record on October 11, 2007.

Item 9.01
Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(c)   Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
September 5, 2007ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM-News), a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 of $12 million ($0.23 per diluted share), compared to $17.3 million ($0.35 per diluted share) in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Sales and other income for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 were $717.5 million, an increase of 4.1 percent from $689.3 million in the same period last year.
SAN FRANCISCO
The decrease in net income is primarily attributable to $12.8 million ($7.7 million after-tax) of self insurance reserve adjustments. This amount is the difference between an increase of $4.9 million in the Company's self insurance reserves in the third quarter of 2007 and the reduction of $7.9 million in the Company's self insurance reserves in the third quarter of 2006.
The third quarter of fiscal 2007 includes $1.8 million of income tax benefits from an increase in deferred taxes associated with the increase in the Company's state income tax rate due to certain legislative changes and reserves no longer required. These tax benefits were partially offset by expenses of $0.7 million ($0.4 million after-tax) related to the start-up of its new Shared Services Center in Houston, Texas and $0.7 million ($0.4 million after-tax) of additional stock-based compensation expense.
"Our top-line growth was driven by new business and expansion of services across four of our five operating segments, most significantly in our janitorial division and in our parking division following the second quarter acquisition of the operations of HeathCare Parking Systems of America," said Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "Exclusive of the increase in insurance reserves for prior years, net income for the third quarter was within the range of our guidance and adjusted gross margin was 10.5 percent compared to 10 percent for the comparable period in 2006. Our most recent evaluation of the Company's self-insurance reserves showed adverse developments in the Company's reserves for 2005 and prior years' non-California workers' compensation, offset by favorable development in the California workers' compensation and general liability programs. The net effect amounts to an aggregate $4.9 million expense in the third quarter. The adverse development was directly related to the claims formerly managed by a third party administrator, which has been replaced. We are currently seeking damages against the former third party administrator and hope the issue will be resolved in 2008."
 
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "We ended the quarter with $107 million in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $357 million in working capital and no debt. We will focus our financial and management resources on businesses in which ABM can grow to be a leading facility services provider. In addition, we will continue to seek operational efficiencies and enhance our competitiveness, such as with our plan to consolidate certain back office functions in the Shared Services Center, which is progressing as planned."
A reconciliation of non-GAAP adjusted gross-margins for the third quarter and nine months ended July 31, 2007 and applicable prior periods is included in the tables below titled: "Reconciliation of ABM's Consolidated GAAP to Consolidated Non-GAAP."
The Company reported net income for the nine months ended July 31, 2007 of $37.4 million ($0.74 per diluted share) on sales of $2.1 billion, compared to $31.6 million ($0.64 per diluted share) on sales of $2 billion in the same period last year.
The Company expects net income for the fourth quarter to be $0.27 to $0.31 per diluted share. The Company's net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 of $1.24 per diluted share included $45.1 million ($0.91 per diluted share) from the settlement of the World Trade Center insurance claims and $5.7 million ($0.12 per diluted share) from the reduction of the Company's self insurance reserves related to prior years' claims. These improvements were partially offset by $1.9 million ($0.04 per diluted share) in charges related to the outsourcing of the Company's information technology infrastructure and services.
Guidance
For fiscal year 2007, the Company expects net income to be in the range of $1.01 to $1.05, which is consistent with the guidance of $1.00 to $1.05 per diluted share provided at the conclusion of fiscal 2006.
On Thursday, September 6, 2007 at 6:00 a.m. (PT), ABM will host a live webcast of remarks by President and Chief Executive Officer Henrik C.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, ABM uses adjusted gross margins to show the amount of sales revenue less cost of goods sold, adjusted for changes to insurance reserves for claims associated with previous periods. These adjustments to ABM's GAAP gross margin are made with the
 
intent of providing both management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, this non-GAAP measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of this additional measure is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of gross margin prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Item 1.01   Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
     On October 7, 2007, ABM Industries Incorporated and OneSource Services Inc., an international business company organized under the laws of Belize, entered into definitive agreements under which ABM will acquire OneSource for $365.0 million in cash, subject to adjustment as provided below, pursuant to a merger of OneSource into a wholly owned subsidiary of ABM.
     OneSource's majority shareholder approved the transaction and no additional shareholder or other corporate approval is required under Belize law. The transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. If the transaction is not completed by November 15, 2007, the purchase price would increase by $100,000 per day until the actual completion date, assuming all other closing conditions were satisfied. There can be no assurances that the transaction will be completed or as to its ultimate timing.
     The foregoing descriptions of the definitive agreements, which include a merger agreement and support agreement, and the related transactions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the merger agreement and support agreement filed hereto as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, respectively, and incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.
     The merger agreement and the support agreement, which have been included to provide stockholders with information regarding their terms, contain representations and warranties by ABM and OneSource made solely for the benefit of the other. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules that the parties have exchanged in connection with signing the merger agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in these agreements were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in these agreements should not be relied on by any persons as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the parties at the time they were made or otherwise.
Item 7.01   Regulation FD Disclosure.
     On October 8, 2007, ABM and OneSource issued a press release related to ABM's acquisition of OneSource.

To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Target Ordinary Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.
Code

The Surviving Company will thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with such individual in contacting those holders that have not so surrendered their Certificates and provide them with further instructions on how to so surrender such Certificates. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of Target as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time will be paid to Parent and the Surviving Company. Any former shareholders of Target who have not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each Target Ordinary Share, as the case may be, that such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Target, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent or any other person will be liable to any former holder of Target Ordinary Shares for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
     (f) In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is
 
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate an amount equal to the Merger Consideration into which the Target Ordinary Shares represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.
     (g) Any profit or loss or interest or other income resulting from any investments of the Payment Fund will be for the account of Parent and be paid to Parent on the earlier of the first anniversary of the Effective Time or the full payment of the Payment Fund.

Such shareholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of the Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 91, except that all Dissenting Shares held by shareholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under such Section 91 will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in the manner provided in Section 1.4. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.3, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any shareholder to be paid the fair value of such shareholder's Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 91 of the IBCA will cease.

ABM INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED

 
Exhibit 99.1
 ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM), a leading facilities services contractor, and OneSource Services Inc. (London AIM: OSS) ("OneSource") announced today that they have signed a definitive agreement under which ABM will acquire OneSource for $365 million in cash. OneSource provides outsourced facilities services, including janitorial, landscaping, general repair and maintenance and other specialized services, for more than 10,000 commercial, industrial, institutional and retail accounts in the U.S.
SAN FRANCISCO AND BELIZE CITY, BELIZE, October 8, 2007
The transaction combines two valuable facilities services platforms to create the scale, breadth and financial strength necessary to grow in the increasingly competitive and global service provider marketplace.
"We saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth strategy and we seized it," said Henrik Slipsager, ABM president and chief executive officer. "Consistent with our long-held commitment to increasing shareholder value, the acquisition of OneSource complements our strategy and further strengthens our growth prospects."
The transaction, which is subject to regulatory and other customary approvals, is expected to close in November 2007. The agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Lord Ashcroft KCMG, OneSource's Chairman who has an interest in approximately 74 per cent of the issued share capital of OneSource, has signed a resolution approving the transaction. No other shareholder approvals are required.
For the trailing 12-month period that ended June 30, 2007, OneSource's sales and adjusted EBITDA were approximately $828 million and $8 million, respectively.
"Beginning after closing and continuing over the following year, we expect to drive OneSource's business to realize operating margins consistent with our janitorial division," Slipsager said. "Our janitorial division has been ABM's best and most consistent performer in recent years, and this investment will provide that team a broader base to continue domestic expansion."
ABM expects to operate the combined company with annual run-rate cost synergies of between $45 and $50 million, which are expected to be fully implemented within 12 months after closing. The company expects to achieve $28 million to $32 million worth of cost synergies in fiscal year 2008, assuming a November 2007 closing. The synergies, which were identified jointly by the two companies, will be achieved primarily through a reduction in duplicative positions and back office functions, the consolidation of facilities and elimination of professional fees and other services.
The company anticipates that the transaction will be accretive to its earnings on a GAAP basis beginning in the second fiscal quarter after closing  excluding one-time
 
2
implementation costs of between $12 million and $15 million, all of which will be incurred in fiscal year 2008.
ABM expects to realize tax benefits from acquiring net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $195 million and from deducting existing goodwill amortization, together expected to initially total $14 million in annual tax cost savings.
"Importantly, this acquisition solidifies our position domestically," Slipsager continued. "Clients today are demanding a range of facilities services from a single source and increasingly seek a company with this depth of capabilities within a broad geographic reach. Any company that wants to be a serious player in an increasingly globalized market must have a strong base in the U.S., demonstrated by the entry of several international firms into the U.S. in the last year. We believe that further expanding our domestic base will enhance our ability to compete globally in the coming years.
"We remain committed to providing the best service to our customers, the best value for our shareholders and the greatest opportunities for our employees. OneSource employees are among the best people in the industry, and we anticipate benefiting not just from acquiring OneSource's business, but also from gaining their world-class personnel. We look forward to working together with our new colleagues," Slipsager concluded.
Lord Ashcroft said, "This is the right move at the right time for OneSource, our clients and our employees. ABM shares our commitment to world-class facilities services and customer satisfaction, and I am proud that OneSource, which has some of the best people in the business, will play an integral role in making ABM even more competitive in an increasingly globalized market."
Following completion of the transaction, the combined company will operate under the ABM name. It will provide a full range of services, including janitorial, parking, security, engineering, landscaping and lighting services for commercial, industrial, institutional, and retail facilities for its customers in the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as in British Columbia, Canada.
Lazard Frres & Co. LLC is acting as financial advisor to ABM.
Jones Day is acting as ABM's legal counsel and Allen & Overy LLP is providing legal counsel to OneSource.

Cautionary Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (1) the possibility that the proposed OneSource merger may not be completed; (2) the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; (3) the risk that the cost savings and
 
4
synergies from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected; (4) the risk that disruption from the merger may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with clients; (5) the risk that the merger may involve unexpected costs; (6) the possibility that the businesses may suffer as a result of the merger; and (7) other issues and uncertainties beyond ABM's or OneSource's control. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties ABM faces is contained in ABM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending October 31, 2006 and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed since such date and in other reports it files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Neither ABM nor OneSource undertakes any obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis, ABM uses non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures are presented with the intent of providing both management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends, ABM's marketplace performance and as one method to estimate a purchase price for companies ABM intends to acquire. In addition, the non-GAAP measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these additional measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures are subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all of the expenses included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment of which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure. Management compensates for this limitation by providing a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP net income.

On October 22, 2007, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") adopted a severance program for senior executives of the Company (the "Severance Program"). The Severance Program will apply to certain senior executives who may be terminated without cause as cause is defined in employment agreements between the executive and the Company and call for payments that vary depending upon the position and tenure of the individual. James P. Lusk, Executive Vice President, James P. McClure, Executive Vice President & President, ABM Janitorial, and Steven Zaccagnini, Executive Vice President & President, ABM Facilities Services, are eligible for payments of 18 months base salary and target bonus, as well as payment of the Company's portion of medical benefits for employees, and up to 18 months of outplacement services. Mr. Lusk will become Chief Financial Officer at the end of calendar year 2007. Henrik C. Slipsager, President & Chief Executive Officer, George B. Sundby, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, and Linda S. Auwers, Senior Vice President & General Counsel are not eligible for benefits under the Severance Program. The Committee expects that the Severance Program will provide consistency in the treatment of officers who are at similar levels in the organization, will protect the Company by requiring a release and post-employment non-competition restriction as a condition to a severance payment, help retain officers during periods of organizational change, and help in recruiting new executives.
On October 23, 2007, the Board of Directors adopted new forms of employment agreements for senior officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. Under the agreements, an officer will be compensated at a base salary set by the Company, be eligible for a bonus in accordance with the bonus incentive program, and be eligible to participate in the Company's equity grant program. An officer will be subject to a number of restrictive covenants, including post-employment non-disclosure, post-employment non-solicitation of employees and customers, non-disparagement, and for an officer outside California post-employment non-competition restrictions.
An officer may terminate an agreement with 60 days written notice.
Officers other than direct reports to the Chief Executive Officer will be offered contracts without a specific term, which will eliminate the need for annual renewals and give the Company more flexibility to make staffing changes. The Company may terminate an agreement without a specific term of employment at any time. In the event an employee is terminated without a good faith determination of "cause" as defined in the agreement, the employee will be eligible for severance pay and other benefits in accordance with the ABM Severance Program in effect at the time of such termination.
 
An officer agreement with a two year term will be offered to Messrs. Lusk, McClure and Zaccagnini as well as the Chief Executive Officer's other direct reports other than Mr. Sundby and Ms. Auwers. Messrs. Lusk, McClure and Zaccagnini will receive the same base salary and incentive compensation under these agreements as previously disclosed. Employment agreements that specify a two year period of employment will automatically renew for an additional term of one year unless the Company gives 60 days written notice of termination prior to the renewal date. For officers with a two-year term agreement, the Company may modify their employment by removing them from their positions and changing their employment status to part-time, for which they will receive the base compensation in effect at the time of modification for the remainder of the term but will not be eligible for bonus compensation. If the Company modifies an officer's employment, and the compensation to be paid to the officer is less than the officer would be eligible for under the Company's Severance Program, then the Company will offer the officer severance benefits in lieu of modified employment.
For officers other than Messrs. Lusk, McClure, and Zaccagnini, who have been extended change-in-control severance agreements, the employment agreements provide that any severance payments upon a change of control will be limited to amounts not subject to excise taxes as "excess parachute payments" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Service of 1986 as amended.
The new forms of agreements have not been offered to or executed by officers.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01
Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
     In connection with the acquisition of OneSource Services, Inc. ("OneSource") (as described below) on November 14, 2007, ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") terminated on November 14, 2007 its $300 million five-year syndicated line of credit that was scheduled to expire on May 25, 2010 (the "old Facility") and replaced the old Facility with a new $450 million five-year syndicated line of credit that is scheduled to expire on November 14, 2012 (the "new Facility"). The new Facility was entered into among ABM, Bank of America, N.A. ("BofA"), as administrative agent, swing line lender, and letter of credit issuer and certain financial institutions, as lenders. The new Facility was used in part to acquire OneSource and is available for working capital, the issuance of standby letters of credit, the financing of capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes.
     Under the old Facility, no compensating balances were required and the interest rate was determined at the time of borrowing from the syndicate lenders based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus a spread of 0.375% to 1.125% or, at ABM's election, at the higher of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500% and the BofA prime rate (the higher of such rates, the "Alternate Base Rate"). A portion of the old Facility was also available for swing line (same-day) borrowings funded by BofA, as swing line lender, at the Interbank Offered Rate ("IBOR") plus a spread of 0.375% to 1.125% or, at ABM's election, at the Alternate Base Rate. The old Facility called for a non-use fee payable quarterly, in arrears, of 0.100% to 0.200% of the average, daily, unused portion of the old Facility. For purposes of this calculation, irrevocable standby letters of credit issued primarily in conjunction with ABM's self-insurance program and cash borrowings were counted as usage of the old Facility. The above-described spreads for LIBOR and IBOR borrowings and the commitment fee percentage were based on ABM's leverage ratio.
     Under the new Facility, no compensating balances are required and the interest rate is determined at the time of borrowing from the syndicate lenders based on LIBOR plus a spread of 0.625% to 1.375% or, at ABM's election, at the Alternate Base Rate plus a spread of 0.000% to 0.375%. A portion of the new Facility is also available for swing line (same-day) borrowings funded by BofA, as swing line lender, at IBOR plus a spread of 0.625% to 1.375% or, at ABM's election, at the Alternate Base Rate plus a spread of 0.000% to 0.375%. The new Facility calls for a non-use fee payable quarterly, in arrears, of 0.125% to 0.250% of the average, daily, unused portion of the new Facility. For purposes of this calculation, irrevocable standby letters of credit issued primarily in conjunction with ABM's self-insurance program and cash borrowings are counted as usage of the new Facility. The spreads for LIBOR, Alternate Base Rate and IBOR borrowings and the commitment fee percentage are based on ABM's leverage ratio. The new Facility permits ABM to request an increase in the amount of the line of credit by up to $100,000,000 (subject to receipt of commitments for the increased amount from existing and new lenders). As of October 31, 2007, the total outstanding amounts under the old Facility were $108.0 million, in the form of standby letters of credit; these standby letters of credit have been replaced and are now outstanding under the new Facility.
     The new Facility includes customary covenants for a credit facility of this type, including covenants limiting liens, dispositions, fundamental changes, investments, indebtedness, and
Table of Contents
certain transactions and payments. In addition, the new Facility also requires that ABM maintain three financial covenants: (1) a fixed charge coverage ratio greater than or equal to 1.50 to 1.0 at each fiscal quarter-end; (2) a leverage ratio of less than or equal to 3.25 to 1.0 at each fiscal quarter-end; and (3) a consolidated net worth of greater than or equal to the sum of (i) $475,000,000, (ii) an amount equal to 50% of the consolidated net income earned in each full fiscal quarter ending after the date of the new Facility (with no deduction for a net loss in any such fiscal quarter), and (iii) an amount equal to 100% of the aggregate increases in stockholders' equity of ABM and its subsidiaries after the date of the new Facility by reason of the issuance and sale of capital stock or other equity interests of ABM or any subsidiary, including upon any conversion of debt securities of ABM into such capital stock or other equity interests, but excluding by reason of the issuance and sale of capital stock pursuant to ABM's employee stock purchase plans, employee stock option plans and similar programs.
     If an event of default occurs under the new Facility, including certain cross-defaults, insolvency, change in control, and violation of specific covenants, among others, the lenders can terminate or suspend ABM's access to the new Facility, declare all amounts outstanding under the new Facility, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, to be immediately due and payable, and/or require that ABM cash collateralize the outstanding letter of credit obligations.
     The lenders and agents under the new Facility and their affiliates have in the past provided, and may in the future provide, lending, commercial banking, and other advisory services to ABM. These parties have received, and may in the future receive, customary compensation from ABM for such services. In addition, ABM and its subsidiaries provide facility services, including janitorial services, to certain of the lenders, their agents and affiliates for which it receives customary compensation. Such services are expected to continue, and additional services and payments may occur, in the future.
     The foregoing descriptions of the old Facility and the new Facility do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the credit agreement relating to the old Facility, dated as of May 25, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference from Exhibit 10.5 to ABM's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed June 9. 2005, and the credit agreement relating to the new Facility, dated as of November 14, 2007, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.
Item 1.02
Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement
     The information set forth above in Item 1.01 regarding termination of ABM's prior $300 million credit facility as of November 14, 2007, is hereby incorporated by reference.

Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
     On November 14, 2007, ABM completed its previously announced acquisition of OneSource, an international business company formed under the laws of Belize, pursuant to a merger agreement dated October 7, 2007. Effective at the closing, OneSource merged into OneSource Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ABM. The purchase price was $365.0 million which was paid by a combination of current cash and borrowings from ABM's new Facility (as described in
Table of Contents
Item 1.01 above). In addition, upon the close of the acquisition, OneSource's existing credit facility was terminated and OneSource's outstanding debt of approximately $21 million was paid in full. As of the close of the acquisition, outstanding debt under the new Facility was $285.0 million.
     The foregoing description of the transaction does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement and Plan of Merger among OneSource, ABM, and OCo Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ABM, which is hereby incorporated by reference from Exhibit 2.1 to ABM's Current Report on Form 8-K filed October 9, 2007.
     ABM and OneSource issued a press release announcing the completion of the acquisition, which is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00 noon shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.
     (b) If any payment to be made by the Company shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
     (c) Unless the Company or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Company or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Company or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, then:
          (i) if the Company failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on demand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds, at the greater of (x) the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and (y) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation; and

pay such amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make a demand therefor upon the Company, and the Company shall pay such amount to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent or the Company may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
     A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Company with respect to any amount owing under this shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
subsection (c)
     (d) If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this , and such funds are not made available to the Company by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.

     WHEREAS, each of the undersigned will benefit from the making of loans and the issuance of letters of credit pursuant to the Credit Agreement and is willing to guarantee the Liabilities (as defined below) as hereinafter set forth;
     NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each of the undersigned hereto agrees as follows:
     Each of the undersigned hereby jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, guarantees the full and prompt payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of (a) all obligations of the Company, howsoever created, arising or evidenced, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due, which arise out of or in connection with the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, as the same may be amended, modified, extended or renewed from time to time, and (b) all reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in enforcing this Guaranty or any other applicable Loan Document against such undersigned (all such obligations being herein collectively called the ""); that the liability of each of the undersigned hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount of the Liabilities which such undersigned may guaranty without rendering the obligations of such undersigned hereunder void or voidable under any fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law.
Liabilities
provided
     Each of the undersigned agrees that, in the event of the occurrence of any Event of Default under Section 8.1(f) of the Credit Agreement with respect to the Company, and if such event shall occur at a time when any of the Liabilities may not then be due and payable, such undersigned will pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders forthwith the
 
full amount which would be payable hereunder by such undersigned if all Liabilities were then due and payable.
     This Guaranty shall in all respects be a continuing, irrevocable, absolute and unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not only collectibility, and shall remain in full force and effect (notwithstanding, without limitation, the dissolution of any of the undersigned, that at any time or from time to time no Liabilities are outstanding or any other circumstance) until all Commitments have terminated and all Liabilities have been paid in full.
     The undersigned further agree that if at any time all or any part of any payment theretofore applied by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any of the Liabilities is or must be rescinded or returned by the Administrative Agent or such Lender for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or any of the undersigned), such Liabilities shall, for the purposes of this Guaranty, to the extent that such payment is or must be rescinded or returned, be deemed to have continued in existence, notwithstanding such application by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to such Liabilities, all as though such application by the Administrative Agent or such Lender had not been made.
     The Administrative Agent or any Lender may, from time to time, at its sole discretion and without notice to the undersigned (or any of them), take any or all of the following actions without affecting the liability of the undersigned hereunder: (a) retain or obtain a security interest in any property to secure any of the Liabilities or any obligation hereunder, (b) retain or obtain the primary or secondary obligation of any obligor or obligors, in addition to the undersigned, with respect to any of the Liabilities, (c) extend or renew any of the Liabilities for one or more periods (whether or not longer than the original period), alter or exchange any of the Liabilities, or release or compromise any obligation of any of the undersigned hereunder or any obligation of any nature of any other obligor with respect to any of the Liabilities, (d) release its security interest in, or surrender, release or permit any substitution or exchange for, all or any part of any property securing any of the Liabilities or any obligation hereunder, or extend or renew for one or more periods (whether or not longer than the original period) or release, compromise, alter or exchange any obligations of any nature of any obligor with respect to any such property, and (e) resort to the undersigned (or any of them) for payment of any of the Liabilities when due, whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have resorted to any property securing any of the Liabilities or any obligation hereunder or shall have proceeded against any other of the undersigned or any other obligor primarily or secondarily obligated with respect to any of the Liabilities.
     Any amounts received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender from whatever source on account of the Liabilities may be applied by it toward the payment of the Liabilities in accordance with the Credit Agreement; and, notwithstanding any payments made by or for the account of any of the undersigned pursuant to this Guaranty, the undersigned shall not be subrogated to any rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender until such time as this Guaranty shall have been discontinued as to all of the undersigned and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have received payment of the full amount of all Liabilities.
 
     The undersigned hereby expressly waive: (a) notice of the acceptance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of this Guaranty, (b) notice of the existence or creation or non-payment of all or any of the Liabilities, (c) presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, and all other notices whatsoever, and (d) all diligence in collection or protection of or realization upon any Liabilities or any security for or guaranty of any Liabilities.
     The creation or existence from time to time of additional Liabilities to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any of them is hereby authorized, without notice to the undersigned (or any of them), and shall in no way affect or impair the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or the obligations of the undersigned under this Guaranty.
     The Administrative Agent and any Lender may from time to time, without notice to the undersigned (or any of them), assign or transfer any or all of the Liabilities or any interest therein; and, notwithstanding any such assignment or transfer or any subsequent assignment or transfer thereof, such Liabilities shall be and remain Liabilities for the purposes of this Guaranty, and each and every immediate and successive assignee or transferee of any of the Liabilities or of any interest therein shall, to the extent of the interest of such assignee or transferee in the Liabilities, be entitled to the benefits of this Guaranty to the same extent as if such assignee or transferee were a Lender.
     No delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in the exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy; nor shall any modification or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty be binding upon the Administrative Agent or any Lender except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered on behalf of the Administrative Agent (or, if at any time there is no Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders or, if required pursuant to Section 10.1 of the Credit Agreement, all Lenders). No action of the Administrative Agent or any Lender permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or the obligations of the undersigned under this Guaranty. For purposes of this Guaranty, Liabilities shall include all obligations of the Company to the Administrative Agent or any Lender arising under or in connection with any Loan Document, notwithstanding any right or power of the Company or anyone else to assert any claim or defense as to the invalidity or unenforceability of any obligation, and no such claim or defense shall affect or impair the obligations of the undersigned hereunder.
     Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, (a) this Guaranty has been delivered to the Administrative Agent and (b) the Administrative Agent has been authorized to enforce this Guaranty on behalf of itself and each of the Lenders. All payments by the undersigned pursuant to this Guaranty shall be made to the Administrative Agent for application as set forth in the Credit Agreement or, if there is no Administrative Agent, to the Lenders for their ratable benefit.
     This Guaranty shall be binding upon the undersigned and the successors and assigns of the undersigned; and to the extent that the Company or any of the undersigned is either a partnership, corporation, limited liability company or other entity, all references herein to the Company and to the undersigned, respectively, shall be deemed to include any successor or successors, whether immediate or remote, to such entity. The term "" as used herein
undersigned
 
shall mean all parties executing this Guaranty and each of them, and all such parties shall be jointly and severally obligated hereunder.
     This Guaranty shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of California. Wherever possible each provision of this Guaranty shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Guaranty.
     This Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, and each such counterpart shall be deemed to be an original but all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same Guaranty. At any time after the date of this Guaranty, one or more additional persons or entities may become parties hereto by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a counterpart of this Guaranty. Immediately upon such execution and delivery (and without any further action), each such additional person or entity will become a party to, and will be bound by all of the terms of, this Guaranty.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Guaranty, any of the undersigned may be released from its obligations hereunder by the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 9.10 of the Credit Agreement. No such release shall affect the obligations of any of the other undersigned, or impair the rights or remedies of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, hereunder.
     Each of the undersigned waives: (i) any defense to the recovery by the Lenders against such undersigned of any deficiency or otherwise to the enforcement of this Guaranty or any security for this Guaranty based upon the election of any remedy by the Administrative Agent against any of the undersigned or the Company, including the defense to enforcement of this Guaranty (the so-called "Gradsky" defense) which, absent this waiver, such undersigned would have by virtue of an election by the Administrative Agent to conduct a non-judicial foreclosure sale (also known as a "trustee's sale") of any real property security for the Liabilities, it being understood by such undersigned that any such non-judicial foreclosure sale will destroy, by operation of California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580d, all rights of any party to a deficiency judgment against the Company and, as a consequence, will destroy all rights which such undersigned would otherwise have (including the right of subrogation, the right of reimbursement, and the right of contribution) to proceed against the Company; (ii) any defense or benefits that may be derived from California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580d or 726, or comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction and all other anti-deficiency and one form of action defenses under the laws of California and any other jurisdiction; (iii) any right to a fair value hearing under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 580a, or any other similar law, to determine the size of any deficiency owing (for which such undersigned would be liable hereunder) following a non-judicial foreclosure sale; (iv) any defense or benefits that may be derived from California Civil Code Sections 2808, 2809, 2810, 2819, 2845, 2849 or 2850 or comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction, and all other suretyship defenses such undersigned would otherwise have under the laws of California or any other jurisdiction.
 
     Without limiting the foregoing, or anything else contained in this Guaranty, each of the undersigned waives all rights and defenses that such undersigned may have because any of the Liabilities are at any time secured by real property. This means, among other things:
     (a) that the Lenders may collect from any of the undersigned without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the Company; and
     (b) if the Administrative Agent forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by the Company: (i) the amount of the Liabilities may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price; and (ii) the Administrative Agent may collect from any of the undersigned even if the Administrative Agent, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right such undersigned may have to collect from the Company.
     The foregoing is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses that any of the undersigned may have because the Liabilities are secured by real property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Sections 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure or comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     Each of the undersigned waives its rights of subrogation and reimbursement and any other rights and defenses available to it by reason of Sections 2787 and 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code, or comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction, including (i) any defenses it may have by reason of an election of remedies by the Administrative Agent and (ii) any rights or defenses it may have by reason of protection afforded to the Company with respect to the Liabilities pursuant to the anti-deficiency or other laws of California limiting or discharging the obligations of the Company, including Sections 580a, 580b, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure or comparable provisions of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
     
ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, SHALL BE BROUGHT AND MAINTAINED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA;
PROVIDED
THAT ANY SUIT SEEKING ENFORCEMENT AGAINST ANY COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE BROUGHT, AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S OPTION, IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION WHERE SUCH COLLATERAL OR OTHER PROPERTY MAY BE FOUND. EACH OF THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION AS SET FORTH ABOVE. EACH OF THE UNDERSIGNED FURTHER IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS BY REGISTERED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO THE ADDRESS SET FORTH UNDER ITS NAME ON THE RELEVANT SIGNATURE PAGE HEREOF (OR SUCH OTHER ADDRESS AS IT SHALL HAVE SPECIFIED IN WRITING TO THE
 
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AS ITS ADDRESS FOR NOTICES HEREUNDER) OR BY PERSONAL SERVICE WITHIN OR WITHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EACH OF THE UNDERSIGNED HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT REFERRED TO ABOVE AND ANY CLAIM THAT ANY SUCH LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.
     
SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH, EACH OF THE UNDERSIGNED, AND (BY ACCEPTING THE BENEFITS HEREOF) EACH OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND EACH LENDER, HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS GUARANTY, OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR ARISING FROM ANY FINANCING RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE FOREGOING, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A JURY.
     
IF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IS FILED IN A COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY OR AGAINST ANY PARTY HERETO IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, (A) THE COURT SHALL, AND IS HEREBY DIRECTED TO, MAKE A GENERAL REFERENCE PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 638 TO A REFEREE (WHO SHALL BE A SINGLE ACTIVE OR RETIRED JUDGE) TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ALL OF THE ISSUES IN SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING (WHETHER OF FACT OR OF LAW) AND TO REPORT A STATEMENT OF DECISION,
PROVIDED
THAT AT THE OPTION OF ANY PARTY TO SUCH PROCEEDING, ANY SUCH ISSUES PERTAINING TO A "PROVISIONAL REMEDY" AS DEFINED IN CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 1281.8 SHALL BE HEARD AND DETERMINED BY THE COURT, AND (B) THE UNDERSIGNED SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE TO PAY ALL FEES AND EXPENSES OF ANY REFEREE APPOINTED IN SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered as of the day and year first above written.

     On December 11, 2007, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results related to fiscal year 2007 and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated into this item by reference.
     On December 11, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on February 4, 2008 to stockholders of record on January 10, 2008. A copy of the press release announcing the declaration of the dividend is attached as Exhibit 99.2, which is incorporated into this item by reference.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
, a leading facility services contractor in the United States, today reported net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 of $15.0 million ($0.30 per diluted share), compared to $61.6 million ($1.24 per diluted share) for the prior year fourth quarter. Included in the fourth quarter of 2006 is a $45.1 million after-tax ($0.91 per diluted share) gain recognized into income for the settlement of World Trade Center (WTC) insurance claims. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 there is a $4.2 million after-tax ($0.08 per diluted share) reduction in the benefits realized from self insurance reserve adjustments. The insurance reserve adjustment for prior years is the difference between a benefit of $2.5 million in the Company's self insurance reserves in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 compared to a benefit of $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
SAN FRANCISCO  Dec. 11, 2007  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
Sales and other income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were $723.9 million, up 3.9 percent from $696.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006.
"We are pleased to achieve the financial targets that we set early in fiscal 2007 and ended the year with a fourth quarter at the upper range of our guidance," said Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "We took action to generate new business and expand services to customers and delivered solid performance across four of our five operating segments."
"Following the close of the quarter, we completed the acquisition of OneSource Services, which represents a significant milestone for ABM since it helps to secure our standing in the domestic facilities services market and positions us to better compete globally," Mr. Slipsager continued. "This acquisition combines two highly valuable facilities services platforms to create considerable scale, breadth and financial strength to continue to expand our business and increase shareholder value. We are on plan for OneSource to be accretive in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, excluding one-time implementation costs."
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "In addition to our business success, our financial position remains very strong. We ended the year with $136.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, and $353.1 million in working capital. We recently replaced our $300 million line of credit with a syndicated five-year $450 million line of credit in conjunction with the acquisition of OneSource.
"We project strong cash flow from operations over the next several years and expect to use it to make key investments in our expansion, to repay outstanding debt, and to support a strong dividend."
1
 
The Company reported net income during the year ended October 31, 2007 of $52.4 million ($1.04 per diluted share) on revenues of $2.84 billion, compared to $93.2 million ($1.88 per diluted share) on revenues of $2.79 billion for fiscal 2006. Sales and other income for fiscal 2007 was $2.84 billion, up 4.8 percent from $2.71 billion in 2006. The difference in net income is primarily due to the recognition of $0.91 per diluted share for the settlement of World Trade Center insurance claims in 2006.
For fiscal 2008, the Company expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.25. This guidance excludes one time expenses of approximately $20.0 million ($0.25 per diluted share) associated with achieving synergies on OneSource as well as a major financial systems upgrade, shared service center implementation, and relocation of corporate headquarters. The Company expects these expenses to be evenly distributed over the four fiscal quarters. In addition, fiscal 2008 has one additional work day of labor, which increases cost by approximately $4.0 million ($0.05 per diluted share) on janitorial fixed price contracts. Including the approximately $20.0 million of one-time expenses, the Company expects fiscal 2008 GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.00. For the first quarter, the Company expects diluted earnings per share without one time expenses to be in the range of $0.14 to $0.18 and on a GAAP basis to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.12 per diluted share.
Guidance
In addition, ABM expects to realize $14 million in incremental cash flow in fiscal 2008 from acquiring net operating loss carry forwards and existing goodwill amortization related to the OneSource acquisition.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance and non-GAAP adjusted gross-margins for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 31, 2007 and applicable prior periods is included in the tables below titled: "Reconciliation of ABM's Consolidated GAAP to Consolidated Non-GAAP."

To supplement ABM's consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, ABM uses adjusted gross margins to show the amount of sales revenue less cost of goods sold, adjusted for changes to insurance reserves for claims associated with previous periods. It has also presented its earnings per share guidance both in accordance with GAAP and excluding certain expected one time expenses. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the non-GAAP gross margin measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute gross margin or earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
On January 1, 2008, James S. Lusk became the Chief Financial Officer of ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company"). Mr. Lusk became an Executive Vice President of the Company in March 2007. Mr. Lusk's biographical information and 2007 compensation information are set forth in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 8, 2007, which is by this reference incorporated herein. Mr. Lusk's 2008 base compensation, target bonus, and equity compensation have not yet been established.
Mr. Lusk has entered into an employment agreement with the Company, with an initial term ended March 19, 2009. Under the employment agreement, he is compensated at a base salary set by the Company, eligible for a bonus that may range from 0 percent to 180 percent of a target bonus in accordance with the bonus incentive program, and is eligible to participate in the Company's equity grant program. He is subject to a number of restrictive covenants, including post-employment non-disclosure, post-employment non-solicitation of employees and customers, and non-disparagement. Mr. Lusk may terminate his agreement with 90 days written notice. Absent at least 90 days written notice of termination of employment or notice of non-renewal from ABM to Executive prior to expiration of the then current term, the agreement renews for a period of one year. The Company may terminate Mr. Lusk's agreement for cause at any time.
The Company has adopted new forms of executive employment agreement and anticipates that Mr. Lusk will enter into a new form of employment agreement in 2008, as described in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 22, 2007, which is by this reference incorporated herein. When Mr. Lusk enters into the new employment agreement, he will be eligible for the Company's severance program for senior executives as described in the Current Report on Form 8-K dated October 22, 2007, which is by this reference incorporated herein.
The Company has also entered into an agreement with Mr. Lusk, similar to those of other top senior management, that governs his compensation should his employment with the Company be terminated under certain defined circumstances following a change in control. The agreements are considered to be "double trigger" arrangements where the payment of severance compensation is predicated upon the occurrence of two triggering events: (1) the occurrence of a change in control; and (2) either the involuntary termination of employment with the Company (other than for "cause" as defined in the agreement) or the termination of employment with the Company for "good reason" as defined in the agreement. The stated benefits consist of (1) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to two times the sum of base salary (at the rate in effect for the year in which the termination date occurs) and current target bonus; (2) the continuation of all health benefits or reasonably equivalent benefits for 18 months following the date of termination; and (3) a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of any unpaid incentive compensation that was earned, accrued, allocated or awarded for a performance period ending prior to the termination date plus the value of any annual bonus or long-term incentive pay earned, accrued, allocated or awarded with respect to service during the performance period. Any payments under the severance agreement will be reduced to the extent that the executive receives payment under his employment agreement with the Company or the Company's severance program following a termination of employment.
 
Payments and benefits under the Company's severance agreements (as well as under all other agreements or plans covering an executive) are subject to reduction in order to avoid the application of the excise tax on "excess parachute payments" under the Internal Revenue Code, but only if the reduction would increase the net after-tax amount received by the named executive officer (the "modified cap") with one exception. The exception is that the reduction may be made to the extent the executive would be entitled to receive, on a net-after tax basis, at least 90% of the severance payment he would otherwise be entitled to under the severance agreement. In consideration for the protection afforded by the severance agreements, the executive agrees to non-competition provisions for the term of employment and for varying periods of time thereafter.
On January 1, 2008, Joseph F. Yospe became Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller of the Company. Mr. Yospe, 49, was elected Senior Vice President, Finance of ABM in October 2007. Prior to that appointment, he was Vice President and Assistant Controller of The Interpublic Group of Companies Incorporated from September 2004 to September 2007; and Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer Genmab A/S from September 2002 to September 2004.
Mr. Yospe has entered into an employment agreement with the Company, under which he is compensated at a base salary set by the Company, eligible for a bonus in accordance with the bonus incentive program, and eligible to participate in the Company's equity grant program. He is subject to a number of restrictive covenants, including post-employment non-disclosure, post-employment non-solicitation of employees and customers, non-disparagement, and post-employment non-competition restrictions. Mr. Yospe may terminate his agreement with 60 days written notice. Mr. Yospe's agreement does not have a specific term, and the Company may terminate the agreement at any time. In the event he is terminated without a good faith determination of "cause" as defined in the agreement, he will be eligible for severance pay and other benefits in accordance with the ABM Severance Program in effect at the time of such termination. In those circumstances under the ABM Severance Program currently in effect, Mr. Yospe would be eligible for payments of 12 months base salary and target bonus, as well as payment of the Company's portion of medical benefits for employees for that period, and up to 12 months of outplacement services. The employment agreement provides that any severance payments upon a change of control will be limited to amounts not subject to excise taxes as "excess parachute payments" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Service of 1986 as amended.
Mr. Yospe's base compensation is $330,000 annually and beginning with the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, he will be eligible for a target bonus equal to 40 percent of his annual base salary. For fiscal year 2008, the Company has guaranteed that Mr. Yospe's bonus will be at target or higher. Mr. Yospe also received a signing bonus of $105,000. Mr. Yospe is eligible to participate in the 2006 Equity Incentive Program as approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Mr. Yospe was awarded an equity grant on October 1, 2007, consisting of 7,708 restricted stock units, which will vest 50% on the second anniversary and 50% on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant; a nonqualified stock option grant for 11,546 shares with an exercise price of $20.43, which will vest over the four years after the date of grant; and 5,628 performance shares, which represent a contingent right to receive shares of common stock based on two-year profit margin and revenue targets in the period ended October 31, 2009. Dividend equivalent rights accrue on the restricted stock units and performance shares.
The resignation of George B. Sundby, former Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, became effective on December 31, 2007. As contemplated in Mr. Sundby's employment agreement, Mr. Sundby will receive a 2007 incentive bonus equal to 50% of his salary, a $100,000 bonus related to the timely filing of the Company's 2007 Form 10-K and effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Upon execution of a release, Mr. Sundby will also receive a severance payment of $540,000 and reimbursement for the cost of certain continuing health insurance benefits. To the extent Mr. Sundby provides consulting services after December 31, 2007, he will receive $300 per hour.

On January 7, 2008, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of ABM Industries Incorporated approved bonuses for executive officers and key employees under ABM's 2007 annual performance incentive program for executives and key employees. The Committee approved bonuses to James McClure, Executive Vice President & President, ABM Janitorial; James Lusk, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer; Steven Zaccagnini, Executive Vice President; and Linda Auwers, Senior Vice President & General Counsel, in accordance with the terms of the 2006 Executive Officer Incentive Plan and the 2007 annual performance incentive program. George Sundby, former Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, under the terms of his Employment Agreement as amended effective March 9, 2007, was entitled to 100 percent of his target bonus of 50 percent of his base salary. However, in recognition of Mr. Sundby's efforts during the year, the Committee approved an amount equal to what his bonus would have been under the 2007 annual performance incentive plan, resulting in a bonus payment of 112 percent of target.
At the January 7, 2008, meeting, the Committee also reviewed the fiscal year 2008 base compensation and target bonuses for Messrs. Lusk, McClure, and Zaccagnini and Ms. Auwers, evaluating current duties and responsibilities and comparative compensation information with the Committee's independent compensation consultant. Following the review, the Committee established base salaries effective as of November 1, 2007, and approved the 2008 annual performance incentive program for executives and key employees.
The criteria used in the annual performance incentive program include Company performance ("Company Results"), individual performance in providing strategic leadership, employee leadership, and compliance and administration ("Individual Performance"), and performance of the operating subsidiaries or department which such executive heads ("Unit Results"). The Company Results component is based on certain targets for income from continuing operations ("Company Income") subject to discretionary strategic results modifiers ("Strategic Results Modifiers") and achievement of a threshold Company Income amount. The performance metrics for the Strategic Results Modifiers include revenue growth, operating profit margins, cash flow, cost reduction and other strategic performance targets.
For Mr. McClure, the Unit Results component of his bonus is based on certain pre-tax net income targets of the Company's janitorial subsidiaries ("Janitorial Income"), subject to strategic results modifiers to include achievement of certain days sales outstanding targets. The Janitorial Results component is subject to achievement of a threshold amount of Janitorial Income. For Mr. Zaccagnini, the Unit Results component of his bonus is based on certain pre-tax net income targets for the Company's Engineering, Parking, Lighting and Security subsidiaries, subject to achievement of threshold amounts of pre-tax net income with respect to each of these businesses. The Unit Results component of Ms. Auwers's bonus will be based on the performance of the Legal Department that she heads in meeting its major objectives for the year. Ms. Auwers is expected to retire on May 15, 2008.
 
The 2008 fiscal year base salaries, target bonuses, bonus factors, weighting and payout ranges for Messrs. Lusk, McClure, and Zaccagnini and Ms. Auwers are shown below:
On January 8, 2008, the independent and outside directors of the Board of Directors approved Mr. Slipsager's 2007 fiscal year bonus in accordance with previously approved criteria and an increase in his base pay to $765,000. They also increased Mr. Slipsager's target bonus for 2008 to 100 percent of his base pay. Mr. Slipsager is not included in the 2008 annual performance incentive plan, although his 2008 performance objectives will reflect a number of similar objectives.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Note 1  Description of business
Introduction
OneSource Services Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on August 30, 2005 as an international business company in Belize with registered number 46,251. The Company is a holding company with no independent business operations or assets other than its investment in its subsidiaries and intercompany balances. The Company's businesses are conducted through its subsidiaries. The principal group and operating companies that comprise the Group are (i) OneSource Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries (principally companies incorporated in the United States) ("OneSource Holdings"); OneSource Holdings is a leading provider of outsourced facilities services, principally providing cleaning and value added building maintenance and support, and landscaping services to commercial, institutional, industrial and retail facilities throughout the United States; and (ii) OneSource Finance, S.A. and its subsidiaries (principally financing companies incorporated in Luxembourg and Iceland). The Company and all of its subsidiaries are herein referred to as the "Group".
On February 7, 2006, the Company entered into a demerger transaction with its then parent undertaking, BB Holdings Limited (a company incorporated in Belize and controlled by Lord Ashcroft, KCMG  ("BB Holdings"), whereby the US facilities services businesses of BB Holdings was transferred to the Company. In consideration for this transfer, the Company issued 3,764,355 additional ordinary shares to BB Holdings. On February 24, 2006, the demerger was completed and, at the same time, the Company's shares were admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) under the ticker symbol  OSS.
Note 2  Summary of significant accounting policies
Principles of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in United States dollars in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the United States. The Group consolidates companies in which it owns or controls more than fifty percent of the voting shares. The results of subsidiary companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the Unites States requires management to make extensive use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Group evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis which include, among others, an allowance for doubtful receivables, impairment of goodwill, estimates of future cash flows and discount rates associated with assets, asset impairments, useful lives of tangible assets, loss contingencies, income taxes and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, insurance reserves and the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension obligations. The Group bases its estimates on historical experience, independent and internal valuations and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at that time. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Currency translation
The reporting and functional currency of the Company is United States dollars. The results of subsidiaries which account in a functional currency other than United States dollars are translated into
 
United States dollars at the average rate of exchange for the year. The assets and liabilities of subsidiaries which account in a functional currency other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Currency translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. Gains and losses arising from currency transactions are included in the consolidated statement of income.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid instruments, with an original maturity of three months or less. As a result of the short-term maturity of these financial instruments, their carrying value is approximately equal to their fair market value.
Trade accounts receivable
Trade accounts receivable arise from services provided to the Group's customers and are generally due and payable on terms varying from the receipt of invoice to net thirty days. The Group does not consider that it has any material exposure due to either industry or regional concentrations of credit risk.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives, calculated using the straight-line method, over the following periods:
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is evaluated periodically in relation to the operating performance and future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying businesses. Where, in the opinion of the Group, a permanent diminution in the value of property, plant and equipment has occurred, the amount of the diminution is recorded in the consolidated statement of income.
Gains and losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are reflected in the consolidated statement of income. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Leases
Leases are classified as capital leases when the terms of the lease transfers substantially all risk and rewards of ownership to the lessee. Capital leases are capitalized and carried as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the life of the lease. The corresponding liability is categorized as short-term and long-term based on the payment terms of the lease. Lease payments are recorded as interest expense and a reduction of the lease obligation.
Leases where risk and rewards remain with the lessor are classified as operating leases. Lease payments are recorded in the consolidated statement of income over the term of the lease.
Goodwill
The goodwill that arises where the acquisition cost of subsidiaries exceeds the fair values attributable to the underlying net assets is capitalized in the consolidated financial statements. With effect from 2001, the Group applied the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS 142"). SFAS 142 eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill and
 
identifiable assets that have indefinite lives and initiated an annual review for impairment. Prior to adoption of SFAS 142, the Group amortized goodwill on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, covering periods not exceeding forty years.
The annual goodwill impairment review is carried out at a reporting unit level. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair market value. The first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step compares the implied fair market value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The aggregate amount of any impairment loss is included in the consolidated statement of income.
The implied fair market value of a reporting unit and its related goodwill is measured by the Group principally by reference to present value techniques, comprising discounted cash flows, based on future revenue and margin projections and plans approved by the Group, with the discount rate based on a risk weighted average cost of capital.
Treasury shares
Treasury share purchases are accounted for under the cost method and recorded as a component of shareholders' equity. Gains or losses on the disposals of treasury shares are credited or charged against contributed surplus.
Net sales
Net sales represent the invoiced value of services provided and goods supplied to customers net of sales-related taxes. Revenue from services or products is recognized in the consolidated statement of income as services are rendered or deliveries are made. The nature of the Group's business is such that revenue is recognized when a written agreement, terms and conditions or an approved customer order is in place and the services have been fully rendered. At that time, pricing is fixed and determinable. The Group's procedures require review of a customer's ability to pay prior to a service provision, at the time of such provision, and at the time of billing, such that collectability is reasonably assured.
Income taxes
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded if management determines it is more likely than not that a portion of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Note 3
Income taxes
(i) The provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of income was as follows:
 
(ii) Income before income taxes included the following components:
(iii) The reconciliation between notional US federal income taxes at the statutory rate (35 percent) on consolidated income before income taxes and the Group's income tax provision was as follows:
 
The net change in the total valuation allowance for the year ended March 31, 2007 was an increase of $5.8 million, principally arising from a net movement in temporary timing differences.
Note 4  (Loss) per ordinary share
Basic and diluted (loss) per share are based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding treasury shares. There were no potentially dilutive ordinary shares during the year ended March 31, 2007.
Note 5  Short-term / long-term restricted cash deposits
 
The Group has pledged certain cash deposits to support its self-insurance program (note 12). In view of the restriction as to the use and availability of the cash deposits to the Group, the balance cannot be classified as a cash and cash equivalent and it has therefore been classified within current assets and non-current assets in accordance with its terms. Classification of restricted cash between short-term and long-term is based upon current and future insurance payouts as projected by the Group's consulting actuary.
Note 6  Trade accounts receivable  net
Note 7  Other current assets
Note 8  Property, plant and equipment  net
At March 31, 2007, property, plant and equipment total cost and total accumulated depreciation includes
 
capital leases of $3.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Total capital expenditures (excluding capital lease additions) for the year ended March 31, 2007 were $4.3 million. For the year ended March 31, 2007, capital lease additions amounted to $3.3 million.
Total depreciation expense (including capital leases) for the year ended March 31, 2007 was $4.8 million.

As required by SFAS 142, the Group undertakes an annual goodwill impairment review. The annual review is performed during the fourth quarter of the financial year, after completion of the Group's annual forecasting process. A goodwill impairment review was performed during the year ended March 31, 2007 as a result of which no impairment of goodwill has arisen.
Note 10  Other long-term assets
Note 11  Short-term debt
In December 2005, OneSource Holdings entered into a new $60 million collateralized, revolving credit facility which can be used for general working capital purposes and letters of credit. The agreement has a term of five years, expiring in December 2010, and is collateralized by a security interest and lien on principally all of OneSource Holdings' assets including accounts receivable.
Under the terms of the facility, OneSource Holdings is required to maintain certain financial and other covenants, including restrictions on OneSource Holdings' ability to incur additional indebtedness, limitations on certain payments, and certain other financial covenants applicable to OneSource Holdings, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Amounts available under the facility are based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable. The Group expects the counterparties to fully perform under the terms of the agreement. The credit facility has been classified as a current liability because the
 
agreement contains a subjective acceleration clause and the lender also has access to OneSource Holdings' lockbox arrangements.
Amounts drawn under the terms of this facility bear interest at the prime rate for daily borrowings or at London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin of 1.5 percent for the term of 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days. The facility also bears interest on the unutilized balance based on the daily unused portion at a rate of 0.25 percent. At March 31, 2007, the weighted average interest amounted to 6.7 percent per annum.
At March 31, 2007, $47.3 million was available, of which $23.6 million was drawn together with letters of credit amounting to $4.3 million with expiration dates up to and including March 31, 2008. The letters of credit approximately reflect fair market value as a condition of their underlying purpose.
In March 2006, OneSource Holdings entered into a $0.8 million collateralized, term loan facility used to purchase capital equipment. The agreement has a term of 36 months, maturing in March 2009. The terms call for monthly recurring repayments with the outstanding balance bearing interest at the prime rate plus 0.5 percent or at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.0 percent for the term of 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days. At March 31, 2007, the weighted average interest amounted to 7.4 percent per annum.
Note 12  Insurance reserves
The Group is self-insured in the United States for workers' compensation, general liability and automobile liability coverage. The Group, however, has umbrella insurance coverage for certain risk exposures subject to specified limits. Estimated actuarially calculated liabilities and provisions under self-insurance programs are based upon historical loss experience and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at the net present value of the estimated obligations within an actuarial range. The discount rate used to calculate the net present value is the estimated risk free rate for investments with maturities matching the anticipated payment pattern of the obligations. The weighted average discount rate used to estimate the liability at March 31, 2007 was 4.7 percent. The discount amortization charged in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended March 31, 2007 was $3.6 million. The independent actuarial valuations were carried out by Alliance Actuarial Services, Inc.
In connection with certain self-insurance agreements, at March 31, 2007 the Group had issued guarantor bonds in the amount of $28.3 million (note 15). Additionally, the Group pledged certain cash deposits to support its self-insurance program. At March 31, 2007, the restricted cash deposits amounted to, in aggregate, $45.0 million (note 5).
 
Note 13  Other current liabilities
Note 14  Other long-term liabilities
Note 15  Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
The Group leases land, buildings, motor vehicles and other equipment under various contracts. The net operating lease rental expense for the year ended March 31, 2007 included in the consolidated statement of income was $12.5 million.
The future total minimum rental payments required under (i) capital leases and (ii) operating leases that have remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at March 31, 2007, are as follows:
 
Contingencies
(i) At March 31, 2007, the Group had issued guarantor surety, performance and other bonds of $46.9 million of which $28.3 million relates to the Group's self insurance arrangements (note 12). These guarantor surety, performance and other bonds are secured by a second lien on all of OneSource Holdings' assets including accounts receivable, and a commitment to provide, in the future, under certain circumstances, letters of credit up to a maximum of $29.3 million.
(ii) Financial instruments which potentially subject the Group to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Group places its cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution. The Group's trade receivables primarily result from its core business and reflect a broad customer base. Credit limits, ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are utilized to minimize the risk of loss. As a result, concentrations of credit risk are considered to be limited.
(iii) At March 31, 2007, the Group is a defendant in a number of pending legal and other proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and dispositions. The Group does not expect the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and cash flows or the consolidated financial position of the Group.
(iv) In November 2005, OneSource Holdings received a claim with respect to a possible liability arising out of its former participation in a certain union multi-employer pension plan. The claim alleged that, as a result of withdrawing from the plan in 2002, a liability has arisen to the extent that there are unfunded vested benefits which fall to be the liability of the former participating employer. Whilst, OneSource Holdings will continue to challenge this claim vigorously through arbitration, in March 2007 the Group determined that it was appropriate to record a charge (discounted) in the amount of $4.1 million which has been included in cost of sales in the consolidated financial statements and will be paid over the period to July 2014.
 
Note 16  Pensions and other plans
Defined benefit pension plan
The Group operates a non-contributory, funded, defined benefit pension plan covering certain of its non-union employees in the United States. Benefits are provided based upon a formula, as defined in the plan documentation, using an employee's length of service and average compensation. In 1989, the Group elected to freeze the plan, whereby no additional benefits are earned by plan members.
The Group's net pension expense included the following components:
The following table sets forth the actuarial present value of projected and accumulated benefit obligations and funded status of the plan:
 
The actuarial assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of accumulated benefit obligations for 2007 were 8.0 percent and 5.8 percent, respectively. The independent actuarial valuations were carried out by AON Consulting Group, using the projected unit credit method of calculation. It is the Group's policy to adjust, on an annual basis, the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation to approximate rates on high quality, long-term bond obligations. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived from a periodic study of historical rates of return on various asset classes included in the Group's target pension plan asset allocation.
The Group's defined benefit plan asset allocation by asset category was as follows:
Employer contributions for the year ending March 31, 2008 are estimated to be approximately $0.9 million.
The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are estimated to be approximately:
Defined contribution pension plan
The Group also has a defined contribution pension plan, which has adopted the salary deferral provisions of Section 401(k) of the United States Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Non-union employees with at least one year qualified service may participate in the plan by contributing up to $15,500 of their salary, the maximum set by the IRC. The Group makes matching contributions equal to 50 percent of the first 5 percent of each participant's elective contributions, for employees with at least two years of qualified service. During the year ended March 31, 2007, the Group made matching contributions of $0.6 million.
 
Deferred compensation plan
The Group also has a non-qualified, funded deferred compensation plan for certain employees not eligible to participate in the defined contribution plan described above. Under this plan, such individuals may elect to defer payment of salary and bonus on a pre-tax basis. The deferral must total at least one percent of the participant's eligible compensation for each plan year in order to participate in the plan, up to a maximum of 30 percent of such compensation, or such smaller percentage as may be established by the Group. The Group makes matching contributions equal to 50 percent of the first 5 percent of each participant's elective contributions. During the year ended March 31, 2007, the Group made matching contributions of $0.3 million. Included in other long-term liabilities at March 31, 2007 was $6.3 million (note 14) for these accumulated obligations. The total number of the Company's issued ordinary shares that were held in the deferred compensation plan at March 31, 2007 was 27,652.
Multi-employer pension arrangements
The Group also participates in several multi-employer arrangements providing defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans as required within the collective bargaining agreements for substantially all union employees. The contributions are determined based on the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. During the year ended March 31, 2007, the Group made contributions of $6.7 million.
Note 17  Share capital
At March 31, 2007, Lord Ashcroft, KCMG, the chairman of, and controlling shareholder in, the Company holds 74.4 percent of the issued ordinary shares.
Note 18  Treasury shares
The movement in treasury shares, at cost, held since April 1, 2006 has been as follows:
 
 
The Company may, from time to time, continue to purchase treasury shares principally in order to meet its 401(k) and deferred compensation plan obligations.
Note 19  Related party transactions and disclosures
(i) During the year ended March 31, 2007, the Company paid $0.2 million in management fee expense, $0.1 million of which represents guarantee fees, to the BB Holdings group for certain administrative and support services. At March 31, 2007, the Group recorded a liability in the amount of $0.1 million for the management fee expense payable to BB Holdings group.
(ii) Subsequent to the demerger between BB Holdings and the Company (note 1), BB Holdings provided: (a) an agreement of indemnity in favour of a provider of performance bonds to the Group relating to a $35 million surety performance bond line, of which $16.1 million was utilized by the Group as at March 31, 2006; and (b) guarantees for the provision of certain lessor equipment, motor vehicle fleet fuel and retrospective insurance premiums with one provider which, as at March 31, 2006, amounted to approximately $1.7 million. At March 31, 2007, such guarantees and indemnities had been released save for the provision of certain lessor equipment approximating $0.5 million. The Group is required to procure the release of BB Holdings from all of its remaining obligations as soon as is reasonably practicable and in any event no later than February 2008.
 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of OneSource Services Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of OneSource Services Inc. and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, movements in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended which, as described in note 2, have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of OneSource Services Inc. and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 2007, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
 
 
Note 1  General
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments necessary to present fairly OneSource Services Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) financial position as of September 30, 2007, and the results of its operations and cash flows for the six months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006. These adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature, except as otherwise noted. All information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and references to the year and periods are based on the Company's fiscal year which ends on March 31 and the six-month period which ends on September 30.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
The information included in this Exhibit 99.2 of this Form 8-K/A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 included in Exhibit 99.1 of this Form 8-K/A, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Note 2  Adoption of a New Accounting Standard
On April 1, 2007, OneSource adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109", which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Under FIN 48, a tax benefit may be recognized from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. FIN 48 did not have an impact on OneSource's financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2007.
In June 2006, the FASB issued Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-3 (EITF 06-3), "How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross versus Net Presentation)." EITF 06-3 requires companies to disclose the presentation of any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing transaction between a seller and a customer (sales and use tax) as either gross or net in the accounting policies included in the notes to the financial statements. EITF 06-3 became effective April 1, 2007. The Company continues to report revenues net of sales and use tax imposed on the related transaction.

Note 3  Earnings per ordinary share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the six-month periods, excluding treasury shares. There were no potentially dilutive ordinary shares during the six months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006.
Note 4  Trade accounts receivable  net
Note 5  Short-term debt
On September 30, 2007, the Company had a $60 million collateralized, revolving credit facility which could be used for general working capital purposes and letters of credit. The agreement had a term of five years, expiring in December 2010, and was collateralized by a security interest and lien on principally all of the Company's assets including accounts receivable.
Under the terms of the facility, the Company was required to maintain certain financial and other covenants, including restrictions on the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, limitations on certain payments, and certain other financial covenants applicable to the Company, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Amounts available under the facility were based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable. The credit facility has been classified as a current liability because the agreement
 
contained a subjective acceleration clause and the lender also had access to the Company's lockbox arrangements.
Amounts drawn under the terms of this facility bore interest at the prime rate for daily borrowings or at London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin of 1.5 percent for the term of 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days. The facility also bore interest on the unutilized balance based on the daily unused portion at a rate of 0.25 percent. At September 30, 2007, the weighted average interest amounted to 6.8 percent per annum.
At September 30, 2007, $53.6 million was available, of which $26.7 million was drawn together with letters of credit amounting to $5.3 million with expiration dates up to and including March 31, 2008. The letters of credit approximately reflect fair market value as a condition of their underlying purpose.
In March 2006, the Company entered into a $0.8 million collateralized, term loan facility used to purchase capital equipment. The agreement had a term of 36 months, maturing in March 2009. The terms called for monthly recurring repayments with the outstanding balance bearing interest at the prime rate plus 0.5 percent or at LIBOR plus a margin of 2.0 percent for the term of 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days. At September 30, 2007, the weighted average interest amounted to 7.6 percent per annum.
On November 14, 2007, the Company was acquired by ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM). In connection with this acquisition, ABM paid in full the outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility and term loan described above and the facilities were terminated. See Note 14, Subsequent Event.

In both of the six-month periods ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company made matching contributions of $0.3 million.
Deferred compensation plan
The Company also has a non-qualified, funded deferred compensation plan for certain employees not eligible to participate in the defined contribution plan described above. Under this plan, such individuals may elect to defer payment of salary and bonus on a pre-tax basis. The deferral must total at least one percent of the participant's eligible compensation for each plan year in order to participate in the plan, up to a maximum of 30 percent of such compensation, or such smaller percentage as may be established by the Company. The Company makes matching contributions equal to 50 percent of the first 5 percent of each participant's elective contributions. In the six-months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company made matching contributions of $0.1 million in both periods. Included in other long-term liabilities at September 30, 2007 was $7.2 million for these accumulated obligations. The Company did not hold issued ordinary shares in the deferred compensation plan at September 30, 2007.
Multi-employer pension arrangements
The Company also participates in several multi-employer arrangements providing defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans as required within the collective bargaining agreements for substantially all union employees. The contributions are determined based on the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. During the six months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company made contributions of $3.6 million and $3.4 million, respectively.
Note 11  Share capital

The disposal of treasury shares comprised 16,415 ordinary shares issued in connection with OneSource Holdings' 401(k) plan and deferred compensation plan obligations.
Note 13  Income taxes
In the six months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, the Company incurred net losses for federal and state income tax purposes. Income tax expense in the six months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 was $ 0.6 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively. Income tax expense in both periods consisted primarily of foreign tax expense incurred as a result of local country profits and fixed dollar minimum state taxes. Due to the Company's taxable loss position, all tax years are subject to examination in the U.S. and state jurisdictions.
As of September 30, 2007, the Company had established a valuation allowance against the full amount of any net deferred tax assets in the United States. The Company currently provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized.
Note 14  Subsequent Event
On November 14, 2007, the Company was acquired by ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM), a leading facility services contractor in the United States that provides janitorial, parking, security, engineering and
 
lighting services for thousands of commercial, industrial, institutional and retail facilities in hundreds of cities throughout the United States and in British Columbia, Canada. In addition, ABM paid in full the $21.4 million outstanding under the Company's credit facility following the closing. The credit facility was terminated and the lien on principally all of the Company's assets including accounts receivable was removed.

 
Exhibit 99.3
 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
     On November 14, 2007, ABM Industries Incorporated (ABM or the Company) acquired OneSource Services Inc. (OneSource), a facility services company, formed under the laws of Belize, with US operations headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The consideration was $365.0 million, which was paid by a combination of current cash and borrowings from the Company's line of credit. In addition, following the closing, the Company paid in full the $21.4 million outstanding under OneSource's then existing credit facility. With annual revenues of approximately $825 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and approximately 30,000 employees, OneSource has been a provider of outsourced facilities services, including janitorial, landscaping, general repair and maintenance and other specialized services, for more than 10,000 commercial, industrial, institutional and retail accounts in the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as in British Columbia, Canada.
     The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet and the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income are based on the historical financial statements of ABM and OneSource after giving effect to the purchase of OneSource by ABM based on the assumptions and adjustments described in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.
     The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information have been prepared using the purchase method of accounting as if the transaction had been completed as of November 1, 2006 for purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income and on October 31, 2007 for purposes of the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet. ABM's fiscal year ends October 31, whereas prior to the acquisition, OneSource had a March 31 fiscal year end. For purposes of the Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income for the year ended October 31, 2007, OneSource's operating income for the year ended September 30, 2007 was moved up to ABM's year end. The twelve-month period for OneSource was derived by adding OneSource's Statement of Income for the six-month period ended September 30, 2007 to OneSource's Statement of Income for the year ended March 31, 2007, and deducting OneSource's Statement of Income for the six-month period ended September 30, 2006 as follows:
     As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations," the purchase price is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the purchase method of accounting based on their respective fair market values, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. The pro forma purchase price allocation has been derived from estimates of the fair market value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of OneSource based upon management's estimates as more fully described in the accompanying Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information. As of January 28, 2008, the Company had not completed the allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition. Accordingly, further changes to the fair values of the assets acquired (including, but not limited to goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, net deferred tax assets, and property, plant and equipment) and liabilities assumed (including, but not limited to insurance claims liabilities) will be recorded as the valuation and purchase price allocations for the acquisition are finalized during fiscal 2008.
 
     The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Income does not include the impacts of any revenue, cost or other operating synergies and non-recurring charges expected to result from the acquisition.
     The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the separate historical Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes included in ABM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007 and OneSource's Consolidated Financial Statements for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2007 and its Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes for the six months ended September 30, 2007 and 2006 included as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 in this Current Report on Form 8-K/A. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is not intended to be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or the financial condition of ABM that would have been reported had the merger been completed as of the dates presented and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of ABM. The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is presented in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X.

NOTE 2. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED BALANCE SHEET
     Under purchase accounting, the purchase price of OneSource is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of November 14, 2007 with any excess purchase price allocated as goodwill.
     As of January 28, 2008, the Company had not completed the allocation of the purchase price of the acquisition. Accordingly, further changes to the fair values of the assets acquired (including, but not limited to goodwill, identifiable intangible assets, net deferred tax assets, and property, plant and equipment) and liabilities assumed (including, but not limited to insurance claims liabilities) will be recorded as the valuation and purchase price allocations for the acquisition are finalized during fiscal 2008.
     The components of the purchase price were as follows:
     For the purposes of determining the purchase price allocation, the fair market value of intangible assets was estimated as of November 14, 2007, the closing date of the acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price was as follows:
 
The following adjustments have been reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet:
The new credit facility, which has been recorded as long-term debt, under which the borrowings were made provides for interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 0.625% to 1.375% or at ABM's election, at the higher of the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and the Bank of America prime rate plus a spread of 0.000% to 0.375%. The credit facility has a maturity date of November 14, 2012.
 
The fair value and remaining useful life of identifiable intangible assets acquired were estimated in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, "Business Combinations" and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."
Customer contracts and related relationships represent continued sales of additional services to existing customers. The value is calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Customer contracts and related relationships are estimated to have a useful life of 14 years and are amortized on a sum-of-the years digits basis to selling, general and administrative expense. Further reviews and evaluations of OneSource's intangible assets may result in a change to the fair value assigned to customer contracts and related relationships and the related amortization period as those reviews and evaluations are finalized.
The following table presents future amortization associated with customer contracts and related relationships acquired:
 
The Company has included an estimate for the amount of net deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, that it expects to record related to the acquisition of OneSource. While the Company has not completed the full analysis as required by FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109 which the Company is adopting at the beginning of the fiscal year ending October 31, 2008, the Company has included an estimate of the amount that it expects to record. A significant portion of the net deferred tax assets relate to NOLs that OneSource had available to it on its tax returns. The future utilization of these NOLs is subject to limitation under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company has not completed the required analysis under the tax law to determine the annual limitation. The Company prepared the pro forma statements following its anticipated tax strategy of incorporating OneSource in the filing of a consolidated tax return. The amount that the Company included in its pro forma statements for net deferred tax assets could be materially different if 1) the consolidated tax return strategy is not executed effectively, or 2) the Company's final evaluation of the deferred taxes indicates that the Company has not met the "more likely than not" threshold that the Company's positions will be sustained upon examination as required by FIN 48. Any changes as a result of our final analysis will be an adjustment to goodwill.
"
While the Company has not yet completed its analysis of the tax attributes acquired as part of the acquisition of OneSource, it has included in the pro forma presentation its best estimate of the amount it expects to record in its historical financial statements based primarily upon (i) management's judgement concerning the realizability of certain OneSource tax attributes based on the representations of the seller and their tax advisors, and (ii) the Company's anticipated tax strategy, including OneSource, in its consolidated tax returns. The amount of deferred tax assets that the Company will ultimately include in its consolidated financial statements may be materially different than as presented herein if, among other things,

(a) On February 7, 2008, Martinn H. Mandles sent a letter to all members of the Board of Directors of ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company"), in which Mr. Mandles resigned as a director of the Company effective immediately. A copy of Mr. Mandles' letter is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K. Mr. Mandles was not a member of any committee of the Board at the time of his resignation.
On January 7, 2008, the Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors unanimously determined not to recommend the nomination of Mr. Mandles to stand for re-election as a director at the Company's 2008 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "2008 Annual Meeting"). The Governance Committee consists of three directors, each of whom is independent within the meaning of New York Stock Exchange listing standards. Mr. Mandles' three-year term as a director was to expire at the 2008 Annual Meeting. In making its determination with respect to a recommended slate of nominees, the Governance Committee considered the qualifications of the directors whose terms in office were expiring at the 2008 Annual Meeting, the needs of the Board, and the Board and Committee year-end evaluation process. The Governance Committee concluded that it would recommend to the Board what it believed to be the best slate of director nominees.
At a meeting of the Board of Directors held on January 8, 2008, the Governance Committee recommended to the full Board that two other incumbent directors whose terms in office were to expire at the 2008 Annual Meeting, Maryellen C. Herringer (who serves as Chairman of the Board) and Anthony G. Fernandes, be nominated to stand for re-election as directors, and that Mr. Mandles not be nominated to stand for re-election as a director.
The Governance Committee informed the full Board of the reasons for its recommendation. Following discussion, which included arguments made by Mr. Mandles and two other directors, Theodore T. Rosenberg and William W. Steele, in favor of Mr. Mandles' nomination, the Board of Directors, by a vote of 7 to 3, accepted the Governance Committee's recommendation. The three dissenting votes at the Board meeting were cast by Mr. Mandles, Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Steele, each of whom is a former officer of the Company.
In his February 7, 2008 letter to the directors, Mr. Mandles stated that the letter "incorporates only [his] opinions and recollections that might or might not be correct." He stated his disagreement with the Board's decision not to nominate him and with "several other [Board decisions] past and present."
 
The letter set forth Mr. Mandles' belief as to why he was not nominated, including, among other things, his unwillingness to habitually support the Company's Chief Executive Officer and agree with other directors; his belief that the other directors are more interested in entrenchment, unanimity and collegiality than in overseeing, monitoring and advising management; his objections to certain acquisitions made by the Company and to the relocation of the Company's corporate headquarters from California to New York; his opposition to any further increases in Board compensation unless justified by earnings and stock price performance; his opposition to any extension or replacement of the Company's shareholder rights plan without shareholder approval; and his opposition to certain matters voted on at a recent meeting of the Board of Directors.
Mr. Mandles concluded his letter by stating that he was resigning as a director because he has "no desire to be where I'm not wanted and welcomed by all of my colleagues, despite our differences." The Company understands this to mean that Mr. Mandles resigned from the Board because he was not nominated by the Board to stand for election as a director at the 2008 Annual Meeting. The Company also believes that this is the reason for Mr. Mandles' resignation.
The Company disagrees with the statements made in Mr. Mandles' letter as to the reasons he was not nominated.
The summary of certain portions of Mr. Mandles' letter set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full letter, which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

Exhibit 17.1
Thursday, February 7, 2008
BY FAX AND/OR EMAIL TO ALL OF THE OTHER DIRECTORS OF ABM INDUSTRIES
Dear Bill, Chuck, Henrik, Linda, Luke, Maryellen, Skip, Ted and Tony:
Signing and sending this letter   will be my last official acts as a director of ABM Industries Incorporated.
ALL of which incorporates ONLY my opinions and recollections that might or might not be correct
Notwithstanding  or because of  my faithful service to ABM's shareholders as an officer and/or director of the Company for 36 years, including eight years as Chairman of the Board (and I'm still only 67 years of age), a majority of you recently decided not to nominate me for reelection to the Board at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Shareholders on March 4th, which explains my absence from the list of candidates (both of whom are other incumbents) in the Company's 2008 Proxy Statement that's now hot off the press. Of course I'm in disagreement with that decision and several others past and present.
As such, I hope that this letter will be accepted as constructive criticism and a wake-up call, instead of being dismissed as "sour grapes from a sore loser," by those of you who prevented my nomination and reelection. Suffice it to say that I practice what I preach  and even teach about director independence at the ISS-accredited UCLA Anderson School of Management Corporate Director Education & Certification Program, of which I'm also a graduate.
Having been stonewalled by ABM's lawyer in seeking to defend myself with regard to any possible allegations of illegal or unethical conduct made in secret against me, I can only conclude that banishment from the Board is nothing more or less than retaliation for my failure and refusal to habitually go-along-to-get-along ("GAGA") with ABM's imperial CEO -and his cadre of GAGA directors, who seem more interested in the entrenchment, enrichment, unanimity and collegiality of the Board than in overseeing, monitoring and advising management  or so it seems to me as a director of the Company.
 
For instance, the written record makes clear my reasonable and responsible objections to what I considered the excessive purchase prices paid by ABM to acquire Security Services of America in 2004 and One Source Services in 2007, as well as my serious doubts about the motive and justification for relocating ABM's corporate headquarters from California to New York in 2008. In the exercise of my management oversight, business judgment and fiduciary duty as a member of the ABM Board, I voted with the loyal opposition against a majority of you on these and several other significant proposals from time-to-time. To do otherwise would have been worse than unconscionable for me as a director of ABM.
Likewise, you were or would be correct to assume that I'm also opposed to any further increase in Board compensation unless and until justified by significant improvements in ABM's earnings per share (reported in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and stock price (reported by the New York Stock Exchange)  and any extension or replacement without shareholder approval of the Company's ten-year "poison pill" beyond its current expiration date of April 22, 2008. I believe that such "perks and pills" are still favored by some perhaps self-serving Boards of Directors, but are now opposed by many more shareholders and their advisors, advocates and activists  of which I'm one!
It's also worth noting that at our most recent Board meeting on January 28, 2008  when the Board was presented with four matters to be decided (for which unanimous written consents had been sought)  I, as merely one of ten directors: (a) voted with the majority twice, (b) raised an issue before and during the meeting that resulted in one proposal being returned to Committee because it benefited directors, but not employees, participating in the same stock option plan, and (c) was the only dissenting vote against approving an almost immediate windfall in restricted stock units for another director and myself, which I will still forego as an intended consequence of this letter. For me, this was "just another day at the office" doing what I believed to be the right things for the right reasons for all three of ABM's inseparable constituencies; our customers, our employees and our shareholders (in alphabetical order).
In doing so, my interests were as always directly aligned with those of ABM's shareholders in general. I own about 50,000 shares of ABM stock in my personal trust, and share voting and investment power for about 1.2 million shares held by third-party trusts of which I'm the trustee or a co-trustee. To the best of my knowledge, this total is exceeded by only one other director  who is also ABM's largest shareholder (9.6%), Ted Rosenberg at about 4.9 million shares. Ted, as well as another ABM director, Bill Steele at about 100,000 shares, both expressed their support for my nomination and reelection to the Board, but all to no avail.
Although I've always considered the shareholders of ABM to be my extended family  and the Company as my home away from home  I have no desire to be where I'm not wanted and welcomed by all of my colleagues, despite our differences. So immediately after signing and sending this letter, I resign from the Board of Directors of ABM Industries Incorporated.
Sincerely,
/s/ Martinn Martinn H. Mandles

Explanatory Note: this Current Report on Form 8-K/A amends the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by ABM Industries Incorporated with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2008.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
(a) On February 13, 2008, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") filed a Current Report on Form 8-K (the "February 13 Form 8-K") in connection with the resignation of Martinn H. Mandles as a director of the Company. In accordance with Items 5.02(a)(3)(i) and (ii) of Form 8-K, the Company provided Mr. Mandles with a copy of the February 13 Form 8-K. On February 14, 2008, Mr. Mandles sent a letter to all members of the Company's Board of Directors, in which he stated that he disagreed with certain of the Company's statements in the February 13 Form 8-K.
Any statement herein relating to Mr. Mandles February 14, 2008 letter is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full letter which, in accordance with Item 5.02(a)(3)(iii) of Form 8-K, is filed as an exhibit to this amendment to the February 13 Form 8-K.

     (d) Exhibits
     17.2 Letter dated February 14, 2008, from Martin H. Mandles.
 
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

 
Exhibit 17.2
BY FAX AND/OR EMAIL TO ALL OF THE OTHER DIRECTORS OF ABM INDUSTRIES
Dear Bill, Chuck, Henrik, Linda, Luke, Maryellen, Skip, Ted and Tony:
This letter is in response to the SEC Form 8-K filed by the Company on February 13, 2008.
In my opinion, ABM's filing was for the most part correct, so I will not take exception to the Company's selective excerpts, additions and deletions in paraphrasing the text of my letter of resignation, because a facsimile of the letter itself was attached verbatim to the Form 8-K.
On the other hand, I disagree with the Company's statement that "The Governance Committee informed the full Board of the reasons for its recommendation," because the ONLY explanation given to the full Board by the Governance Committee was that, "We think it is in the best interest of our stockholders not to renominate Martinn."
Although ABM states in its Form 8-K that, "The Company disagrees with the statements made in Mr. Mandles' letter as to the reasons he was not nominated," ABM is yet to disclose to me  or to the SEC  any reason WHY the Governance Committee and a majority of the full Board believed it was "in the best interest of our stockholders not to renominate Martinn."
Therefore, my letter of resignation will continue to speak for itself, and for me.
Sincerely,
/s/ Martinn Martinn H. Mandles

Exhibit 99.1
CONTACT: Jim Lusk Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer ABM Industries Inc. (212) 297-0200
a leading facility services contractor, today reported sales and other income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of $922.6 million, up 31.1% from $703.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $6.4 million ($0.13 per diluted share), compared to $8.7 million ($0.18 per diluted share) for the prior year first quarter.
NEW YORK, NY  March 3, 2008  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
"Our record first quarter revenue and solid earnings per share of $0.13, which exceeded guidance, reflects the initial operational improvements and synergies we are achieving with our recent acquisitions combined with the strength of our existing business," stated Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer.
The Company's non-GAAP earnings from operations increased 93.5% to $18.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 from $9.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The non-GAAP earnings from operations excludes several items affecting comparability, including a benefit from the reduction of the Company's self-insurance reserves that increased net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 and expenses associated with achieving synergies at OneSource and corporate initiatives that reduced net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 (see "Reconciliation of ABM Industries Non-GAAP Earnings from Operations to Consolidated Operating Income" in the accompanying financial tables).
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "We are very pleased with our performance, which is primarily due to the revenues contributed by the recent OneSource acquisition, new business in Janitorial, Parking and Engineering segments and cost saving synergies. The pace of our business remains strong despite the current economic climate. We are on track with the integration of OneSource and our most recent acquisition, Southern Management, and the development of our new strategic core platform. OneSource has surprised us to the upside with a annual revenue run rate $25 million to $50 million higher than anticipated."

Guidance
Based on continued organic growth, the benefit of recent acquisitions and lower costs associated with the Company's infrastructure initiatives, the Company is increasing its fiscal 2008 guidance. The Company now expects fiscal 2008 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.35. This excludes expenses of approximately $16.0 million ($0.20 per diluted share) associated with achieving infrastructure initiatives. In addition, fiscal 2008 has one additional work day, which is expected to increase labor expenses in the second quarter by approximately $4.0 million ($0.05 per diluted share) due to janitorial fixed price contracts. Including the approximately $16.0 million of expenses for infrastructure initiatives, the Company now expects fiscal 2008 GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.15.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance and non-GAAP earnings from operations for the quarter ended January 31, 2008 and applicable prior periods is included in the tables below titled: "Reconciliation of ABM Industries Non-GAAP Earnings from Operations to Consolidated Operating Income".

2
 
environment that may be inadequate to support the growth of the business; (3) disruption in functions affected by the transition to a Shared Services Center and relocation of corporate headquarters from San Francisco to New York City; (4) a change in the frequency or severity of claims against the Company, a deterioration in claims management, the cancellation or non-renewal of the Company's primary insurance policies or a change in our customers' insurance needs; (5) a change in estimated claims; (6) debt service requirements that cause expense variations and affect cash flow; (7) labor disputes that lead to a loss of sales or expense variations; (8) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates lowers sales and profitability; (9) financial difficulties or bankruptcy of a major customer; (10) acquisition activity slows; (11) the loss of long-term customers; (12) intense competition that lowers revenue or reduces margins; (13) an increase in costs that the Company cannot pass on to customers; (14) natural disasters or acts of terrorism that disrupt the Company in providing services; (15) significant accounting and other control costs that reduce the Company's profitability; and (16) other issues and uncertainties that may include: unanticipated adverse jury determinations, judicial rulings or other developments in litigation to which the Company is subject, new accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies, changes in U.S. immigration law that raise the Company's administration costs, labor shortages that adversely affect the Company's ability to employ entry level personnel, legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally impacts the Company's expenses or reduces sales by adversely affecting the Company's customers, a reduction or revocation of the Company's line of credit that increases interest expense and the cost of capital, low levels of capital investments by customers, which tend to be cyclical in nature, that adversely impact the results of the Company's Lighting segment; and the resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more of the Company's key executives that adversely affects customer retention or day-to-day management of the Company.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, ABM has presented its first quarter operating income for fiscal 2008 and 2007, and fiscal 2008 guidance as adjusted for items impacting comparability. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the non-GAAP earnings from operations measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute gross margin or earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Item 2.02
Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
     On June 3, 2008, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") issued a press release announcing financial results related to the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated into this item by reference.
Item 8.01
Other Events.
     On June 3, 2008, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on August 4, 2008 to stockholders of record on July 3, 2008. A copy of the press release announcing the declaration of the dividend is attached as Exhibit 99.2, which is incorporated into this item by reference.
Item 9.01
Financial Statements and Exhibits.
(c) Exhibits.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

Exhibit 99.1
a leading facility services contractor, today reported sales and other income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 of $938.5 million, up 34.5%, from $697.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2008 was $11.1 million ($0.22 per diluted share), compared to $16.7 million ($0.33 per diluted share) for the prior year second quarter.
NEW YORK, NY  June 3, 2008  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
The Company's non-GAAP earnings from operations increased 25.2% to $25.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, from $20.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The non-GAAP earnings from operations excludes several items affecting comparability, including a charge associated with the impairment of goodwill in the Company's Lighting segment, which had a $4.5 million ($0.08 per diluted share) impact. The majority of the goodwill impairment is not tax deductible. In addition, expenses associated with corporate and infrastructure initiatives, and the integration of OneSource reduced net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. These were partially offset by a benefit from the reduction in self-insurance reserves relating to prior years in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. The second quarter of 2007 included a gain from the sale of an off-airport parking garage lease. (See "Reconciliation of ABM Industries Non-GAAP Earnings from Operations to Consolidated Operating Profit" in the accompanying financial tables.)
"Our strong second quarter performance reflects continued organic growth of our broad customer base and the benefit of recent acquisitions, which contributed $219.0 million of additional revenue," stated Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "We executed well against our operating plans and experienced strong revenue and non-GAAP earnings from operations in our Janitorial, Parking, Security and Engineering segments, despite the current economic environment and one additional work day in the quarter, which increases labor expenses on Janitorial fixed price contracts. We continue to make excellent progress on the integration of OneSource and have met many of our key milestones, including realizing $6.8 million in synergies, a $14.5 million reduction in our outstanding debt, and with the OneSource transaction accretive in the second quarter. To date, we have accomplished, on an annualized basis, approximately 50 to 60 percent of the cost saving synergies related to the integration of OneSource, which is slightly better than anticipated."
Mr. Slipsager concluded, "I am very pleased with the way our people are performing across our segments and remain confident that our operating discipline will serve us well as we leverage our recent acquisitions. We are conducting a strategic evaluation of our lighting segment as we continue focusing management's attention and capital on our core businesses."
The Company reported net income for the six months ended April 30, 2008 of $17.4 million ($0.34 per diluted share) on sales of $1.9 billion, compared to $25.4 million ($0.51 per diluted
1
 
share) on sales of $1.4 billion in the same period last year. Excluding items affecting comparability, the Company's non-GAAP earnings from operations increased 46.8% to $43.9 million in the first six months of fiscal 2008 from $29.9 million in the same period last year. (See "Reconciliation of ABM Industries Non-GAAP Earnings from Operations to Consolidated Operating Profit" in the accompanying financial tables.)
Guidance
The Company is maintaining its fiscal 2008 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance of $1.20 to $1.35. The Company continues to expect fiscal 2008 GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.00 to $1.15. In addition, as previously communicated, fiscal 2008 has one additional work day, which increased labor expenses by $2.3 million ($0.05 per diluted share) in the second quarter due to Janitorial fixed price contracts.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance for fiscal 2008 is included in the tables below titled: "Reconciliation of Consolidated GAAP to Consolidated Non-GAAP Earnings Guidance for 2008."

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

2
 
on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2008. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the remainder of the year. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (1) diversion of management time and focus from operations as a result of the OneSource and other acquisitions or the failure to timely realize anticipated cost savings and synergies or at all; (2) functional delays and resource constraints from the Company's transition to new information technology systems; (3) disruption in functions affected by the transition to a Shared Services Center and relocation of corporate headquarters from San Francisco to New York City; (4) a change in the frequency or severity of claims against the Company, a deterioration in claims management, the cancellation or non-renewal of the Company's primary insurance policies or a change in our customers' insurance needs; (5) a change in the Company's estimated claims costs that affects results as the Company bases its pricing in part on estimated claims costs; (6) debt service requirements that cause expense variations and affect cash flow; (7) impairment of goodwill recognized on the OneSource or other acquisitions; (8) labor disputes that lead to a loss of sales or expense variations; (9) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates that lowers sales and profitability; (10) financial difficulties or bankruptcy of a major customer; (11) slowing of acquisition activity; (12) the loss of long-term customers; (13) intense competition that lowers revenue or reduces margins; (14) an increase in costs that the Company cannot pass on to customers; (15) natural disasters or acts of terrorism that disrupt the Company in providing services; (16) significant accounting and other control costs that reduce the Company's profitability; and (17) other issues and uncertainties that may include: unanticipated adverse jury determinations, judicial rulings or other developments in litigation to which the Company is subject, new accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies, changes in U.S. immigration law that raise the Company's administration costs, labor shortages that adversely affect the Company's ability to employ entry level personnel, legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally impacts the Company's expenses or reduces sales by adversely affecting the Company's customers, a reduction or revocation of the Company's line of credit that increases interest expense and the cost of capital, low levels of capital investments by customers, which tend to be cyclical in nature, that adversely impact the results of the Company's Lighting segment; and the resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more of the Company's key executives that adversely affects customer retention or day-to-day management of the Company. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties the Company faces is contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other reports it files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated condensed financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, ABM has presented its second quarter operating profit for fiscal 2008 and 2007, and fiscal 2008 guidance as adjusted for items impacting comparability. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, non-GAAP earnings from operations is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute gross margin or earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Exhibit 10.2
EXECUTION COPY
          This Amended and Restated Severance Agreement (this "Agreement"), effective as of July 15, 2008, is made between ABM Industries Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and the individual executing this Agreement as the Executive on the signature page (the "Executive").
     A. The Executive is a senior executive of the Company and has made and is expected to continue to make major contributions to the short- and long-term profitability, growth and financial strength of the Company;
     B. The Company recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control exists and that such possibility, and the uncertainty it may create among management, may result in the distraction or departure of management personnel, to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders, including a reduction of the value received by stockholders in a Change in Control transaction;
     C. The Executive and the Company are party to a Severance Agreement dated December 13, 2005 (the "Prior Agreement");
     D. The parties desire to amend and restate the Prior Agreement to reflect changes required to comply with Section 409A and Section 162(m) of the Code;
     E. The Company desires to assure itself of both present and future continuity of management and to establish fixed severance benefits for certain of its senior executives, including the Executive, applicable in the event of a Change in Control; and
     F. The Company desires to provide additional inducement for the Executive to continue to remain in the employ of the Company. Accordingly, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:
     1. . In addition to terms defined elsewhere herein, the following terms have the following meanings when used in this Agreement with initial capital letters:
Certain Defined Terms
          (a) "After-Tax Amount" means the amount to be received by an Executive determined on an after-tax basis taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law and any applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes.
          (b) "Base Pay" means the Executive's annual base salary rate as in effect at the time a determination is required to be made under Section 4.
 
          (c) "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company; any action of the Board herein contemplated will be valid if adopted by a majority of the total number of directors then in office or a majority of the Incumbent Directors and, for purposes of interpreting, amending or waiving any portion of this Agreement, may be adopted by a majority of the Incumbent Directors by written action, whether or not unanimous, or may be delegated by specific action of the Board of Directors after the date hereof to any directorate committee comprised solely of Incumbent Directors who are also Independent Directors.
          (d) "Cause" means that, prior to any termination, the Executive shall have:
               (i) been charged with a crime involving fraud, embezzlement or theft in connection with Executive's duties or in the course of Executive's employment with the Company or any Subsidiary or been convicted of a felony;
               (ii) intentionally breached his fiduciary obligations to the Company or any securities laws applicable to the Company; or
               (iii) committed intentional wrongful engagement in any Competitive Activity;
and any such act shall have been demonstrably and materially harmful to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, no act or failure to act on the part of the Executive will be deemed "intentional" if it was due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence, but will be deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive will not be deemed to have been terminated for "Cause" hereunder unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose, after reasonable notice to the Executive and an opportunity for the Executive, together with the Executive's counsel (if the Executive chooses to have counsel present at such meeting), to be heard before the Board, finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board after consultation with outside counsel, there is clear and convincing evidence that the Executive had committed an act constituting "Cause" as herein defined and specifying the particulars thereof in reasonable detail. Nothing herein will limit the right of the Executive or Executive's beneficiaries to contest the validity or propriety of any such determination.
          (e) "Change in Control" means that during the Term any of the following events occurs, provided that the occurrence of such event constitutes a "change in effective ownership or control" of the Company, as defined in Section 409A:

within the meaning of Rule 14a-12(c) under the Exchange Act and (B) within 18 months after either such event, individuals who were members of the Board of Directors of the Company immediately prior to either such event cease to constitute a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company; or
               (ii) a majority of the Board ceases to be comprised of Incumbent Directors; or
               (iii) the consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, plan of liquidation or dissolution, recapitalization or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the acquisition of the stock or assets of another corporation, or other transaction (each, a "Business Transaction"), unless, in any such case, (A) no Person (other than the Company, any entity resulting from such Business Transaction or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company, any Subsidiary or such entity resulting from such Business Transaction) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 35% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Voting Stock of the entity resulting from such Business Transaction or, if it is such entity, the Company and (B) at least one-half of the members of the Board of Directors of the entity resulting from such Business Transaction were Incumbent Directors at the time of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business Transaction.
          (f) "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
          (g) "Competitive Activity" means the Executive's participation, without the written consent signed by an officer of the Company and authorized by the Board, in the management of any business enterprise if (i) such enterprise engages in substantial and direct competition with the Company and such enterprise's sales of any product or service competitive with any product or service of the Company amounted to 10% of such enterprise's net sales for its most recently completed fiscal year and if the Company's net sales of said product or service amounted to 10% of the Company's net sales for its most recently completed fiscal year or (ii) the primary business done or intended to be done by such enterprise is in direct competition with the business of providing facility services in any geographic market in which the Company operates. "Competitive Activity" will not include the mere ownership of securities in any such enterprise and the exercise of rights appurtenant thereto, if such ownership is less than 5% of the outstanding voting securities or units of such enterprise.
          (h) "Employee Benefits" means the benefits and service credit for benefits as provided under any and all employee retirement income and welfare benefit policies, plans, programs or arrangements in which the Executive is entitled to participate, including without limitation any stock option, performance share, performance unit, stock purchase, stock appreciation, savings, pension, supplemental executive retirement, or other retirement income or welfare benefit, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, group or other life, health, medical/hospital or other insurance (whether funded by actual insurance or self-insured by the Company or a Subsidiary), disability, salary continuation, expense reimbursement and other employee benefit policies, plans,
 
programs or arrangements that may now exist or any equivalent successor policies, plans, programs or arrangements that may be adopted hereafter by the Company or a Subsidiary, providing benefits and service credit for benefits at least as great in the aggregate as are payable thereunder immediately prior to a Change in Control.

               (ii) Failure of the Company to remedy any of the following within 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company of written notice thereof from the Executive: (A) a significant adverse change in the nature or scope of the authorities, powers or functions attached to the position with the Company which the Executive held immediately prior to the Change in Control, (B) a material reduction in the Executive's Base Pay, (C) a material reduction in the Executive's Incentive Pay Opportunity or Incentive Pay Target, or (D) the termination or denial of the Executive's rights to material Employee Benefits or a material reduction in the scope or value thereof, unless such termination or reduction referred to in clauses (B), (C) or (D) applies on a substantially similar basis to all executives of the Company and its parent entities or such right is replaced with a right with a substantially similar scope or value;
               (iii) The liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company or the transfer of all or substantially all of its business and/or assets, unless the successor or successors (by liquidation, merger, consolidation, reorganization, transfer or otherwise) to which all or substantially all of its business and/or assets have been transferred (by operation of law or otherwise) assumed all duties and obligations of the Company under this Agreement pursuant to Section 11(a);
               (iv) If the Executive's principal residence at the time in question is within 35 miles of the Company's headquarters or the headquarters of the Subsidiary

               (v) Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, any material breach of this Agreement or any Other Employment Agreement (as defined in Section 6) by the Company or any successor thereto which is not remedied by the Company within 10 calendar days after receipt by the Company of written notice from the Executive of such breach.
A termination of employment by the Executive for one of the reasons set forth in clauses (i)  (v), above, will not constitute "Good Reason" unless, within the 60-day period immediately following the occurrence of such Good Reason event, the Executive has given written notice to the Company specifying in reasonable detail the event or events relied upon for such termination and the Company has not remedied such event or events within 10 days of the receipt of such notice. The Company and the Executive may mutually waive in writing any of the foregoing provisions with respect to an event or events that otherwise would constitute Good Reason.
          (m) "Incumbent Directors" means the individuals who, as of the date hereof, are Directors of the Company and any individual becoming a Director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, nomination for election by the Company's shareholders or appointment was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the then Incumbent Directors (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which such person is named as a nominee for director, without objection to such nomination); provided, however, that an individual shall not be an Incumbent Director if such individual's election or appointment to the Board occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest (as described in Rule 14a-12(c) of the Exchange Act) with respect to the election or removal of Directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board.
          (n) "Incentive Pay" means compensation in addition to Base Pay determined by reference to one or more performance measures, whether payable in cash, securities or otherwise.
          (o) "Incentive Pay Opportunity" means the maximum amount of Incentive Pay that the Executive would receive pursuant to any Incentive Pay Plan in existence immediately prior to a Change in Control (disregarding the effects of the Change in Control, including without limitation increased depreciation or amortization, financing expense and transaction costs), assuming satisfaction of all thresholds or other conditions thereto established (i) prior to the Change in Control or (ii) after the Change in Control either (A) with the Executive's specific prior written approval or (B) by action of a committee of the Board comprised solely of Independent Directors.
 
          (p) "Incentive Pay Plan" means any plan, program, agreement or arrangement (excluding employee stock options, restricted stock or other rights the value of which is determined solely by reference to the value of the Company's common stock).
          (q) "Incentive Pay Target" means the amount or value of Incentive Pay the Executive would have received assuming that the Incentive Pay Plans in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control continue unchanged and are satisfied at the target level and, if applicable, any conditions to entitlement to payment at the target level thereunder that are not measured by the Company's results of operation are satisfied at the target level.
          (r) "Independent Directors" means directors who qualify as "independent" directors under then-applicable New York Stock Exchange rules applicable to compensation committees (whether or not the Company's securities continue to be listed for trading thereon).
          (s) "Other Agreement" means an agreement, contract or understanding (including any option or equity plan or agreement) other than this Agreement, heretofore or hereafter entered into by the Executive with the Company or any Subsidiary.
          (t) "Retirement Plans" means the benefit plans of the Company that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and any supplemental executive retirement benefit plan or any other plan that is a successor thereto as such Retirement Plans were in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control and if the Executive was a participant in such Retirement Plan immediately prior to the Change in Control.
          (u) Section 162(m) means Section 162(m) of the Code, and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder, or any successor statute.

          (y) "Term" means the period commencing as of the date hereof and expiring on the close of business on December 31, 2008; provided, however, that (i) commencing on January 1, 2009 and each January 1 thereafter, the term of this Agreement will automatically be extended for an additional year unless, not later than September 30 of the immediately preceding year, the Company or the Executive shall have given notice that it or the Executive, as the case may be, does not wish to have the Term extended; (ii) if a Change in Control occurs during the Term, the Term will expire
 
on the last day of the Severance Period; and (iii) subject to Section 3(c), if, prior to a Change in Control, the Executive ceases for any reason to be a full-time employee of the Company, thereupon without further action the Term shall be deemed to have expired and this Agreement will immediately terminate and be of no further effect.
          (z) "Termination Date" means the date on which the Executive's employment is terminated (the effective date of which will be the date of termination, or such other date that may be specified by the Executive if the termination is pursuant to Section 3(b)).
          (aa) "Voting Stock" means securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.

     2. . This Agreement will be effective and binding immediately upon its execution, but, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, except as provided in Section 3(c), this Agreement will not be operative unless and until a Change in Control occurs. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control at any time during the Term, without further action, this Agreement will become immediately operative.
Operation of Agreement
     3. . (a) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Executive's employment may be terminated by the Company during the Severance Period and the Executive will be entitled to the benefits provided by Section 4 unless such termination is the result of the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
Termination Following a Change in Control
               (i) The Executive's death;
               (ii) if the Executive becomes permanently disabled within the meaning of, and begins actually to receive disability benefits pursuant to, the long-term disability plan in effect for, or applicable to, the Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control; or
               (iii) Cause.
If, during the Severance Period, the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than pursuant to Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii) or 3(a)(iii), the Executive will be entitled to the benefits provided by Section 4, provided that such termination constitutes a "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A.
          (b) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Executive may terminate employment with the Company during the Severance Period for
 
Good Reason with the right to severance compensation as provided in Section 4 regardless of whether any other reason, other than Cause, for such termination exists or has occurred, including without limitation other employment.
          (c) Nothing in this Agreement will (i) be construed as creating an express or implied contract of employment, changing the status of Executive as an employee at will, giving Executive any right to be retained in the employ of the Company, or giving Executive the right to any particular level of compensation or benefits or (ii) interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the employment of the Executive at any time with or without Cause, subject in either case to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.
     4. . (a) If, following the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company terminates the Executive's employment during the Severance Period other than pursuant to Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii) or 3(a)(iii), or if the Executive terminates Executive's employment pursuant to Section 3(b) (any such termination, a "Triggering Termination"), provided that such Triggering Termination constitutes a "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A, the Company will pay to the Executive the amounts described in Annex A within five business days after the Termination Date (subject to the provisions of Section 4(d) of this Agreement) and will continue to provide to the Executive the benefits described in Annex A for the periods described therein.
Severance Compensation
          (b) Without limiting the rights of the Executive at law or in equity, if the Company fails to make any payment or provide any benefit required to be made or provided hereunder on a timely basis, the Company will pay interest on the amount or value thereof at an annualized rate of interest equal to the "prime rate" as set forth from time to time during the relevant period in The Wall Street Journal "Money Rates" column, plus 200 basis points, compounded monthly, or, if less, the maximum rate legally allowed. Such interest will be payable as it accrues on demand. Any change in such prime rate will be effective on and as of the date of such change.
          (c) Unless otherwise expressly provided by the applicable plan, program or agreement, after the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company will pay in cash to the Executive a lump sum amount equal to the sum of (i) any unpaid Incentive Pay that has been earned, accrued, allocated or awarded to the Executive for any performance period that by its terms as in effect prior to a Triggering Termination has been completed (any such period, a "Completed Performance Period") (regardless of whether payment of such compensation would otherwise be contingent on the continuing performance of services by the Executive) and (ii) the Pro Rata Portion of the Incentive Pay Target in effect for any subsequent performance period. For this purpose, "Pro Rata Portion" means (x) the number of days from and including the first day immediately following the last day of the immediately preceding Completed Performance Period to and including the Termination Date, divided by (y) the total number of days in such subsequent performance period. Such payments will be made at the earlier of (x) the date prescribed for payment pursuant to the applicable plan, program or agreement and (y)
 
within five business days after the Termination Date, and will be payable and calculated disregarding any otherwise applicable vesting requirements.
          (d) To the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Executive's termination of employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Executive's termination of employment (or upon the Executive's death, if earlier). In addition, for purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments described in Annex A that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise.
     5. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any Other Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement or any Other Agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment (including after taking into account the value, to the maximum extent permitted by Section 280G of the Code, of the covenants in Section 8 hereof), but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement and any Other Agreement will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction will not be made if such reduction would result in Executive receiving an After-Tax Amount less than 90% of the After-Tax Amount of the severance payments he or she would have received under Section 4 or under any Other Agreement without regard to this clause. Whether requested by the Executive or the Company, the determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is required pursuant to the preceding sentence, and the value to be assigned to the Executive's covenants in Section 8 hereof for purposes of determining the amount, if any, of the Excess Parachute Payment will be made at the expense of the Company by the Company's independent accountants or benefits consultant. The fact that the Executive's right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 5 will not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or any Other Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 5, the Executive will be entitled to designate the payments and/or benefits to be so reduced in order to give effect to this Section 5, provided, however, that payments that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall be reduced first. The Company will provide the Executive with all information reasonably requested by the Executive to permit the Executive to make such designation. In the event that the Executive fails to make such designation within 10 business days after receiving notice from the Company of a reduction under this Section 5, the Company may effect such reduction in any manner it deems appropriate.
Limitations on Payments and Benefits
 
     6. . (a) The Company hereby acknowledges that it will be difficult and may be impossible for the Executive to find reasonably comparable employment following the Termination Date. Accordingly, the payment of the severance compensation by the Company to the Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is hereby acknowledged by the Company to be reasonable, and the Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings or other benefits from any source whatsoever create any mitigation, offset, reduction or any other obligation on the part of the Executive hereunder or otherwise, except as expressly provided in Paragraph 2(E) of Annex A.
No Mitigation Obligation; Other Agreements
          (b) A termination of employment pursuant to Section 3(a), 3(b) or 3(c) will not affect any rights that the Executive may have pursuant to any agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company or Subsidiary providing Employee Benefits, which rights will be governed by the terms thereof. To the extent that the Executive receives payments by reason of his or her termination of employment pursuant to any other employment or severance agreement or employee plan (collectively, "Other Employment Agreements"), the amounts otherwise receivable under Section 4 will be reduced by the amounts actually paid pursuant to the Other Employment Agreements, but not below zero, to avoid duplication of payments so that the total amount payable or value of benefits receivable hereunder and under the Other Employment Agreements is not less than the amounts so payable or value so receivable had such benefits been paid in full hereunder.
     7. . It is the intent of the Company that the Executive not be required to incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Executive's rights in connection with any dispute arising under this Agreement because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive hereunder. Accordingly, if it should appear to the Executive that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Executive the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain counsel of Executive's choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to advise and represent the Executive in connection with any such dispute or proceeding. Without respect to whether the Executive prevails, in whole or in part, in connection with any of the foregoing, the Company will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all reasonable attorneys' and related fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that, in regard to such matters, the Executive has not acted in bad faith or with no colorable claim of success. The Executive shall promptly submit a written request for reimbursement of such expenses, but in no event later than ninety days following the date on which such expenses were incurred, accompanied by such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company may reasonably require, and such reimbursements will be made within ten business days after delivery of the Executive's written requests for payment.
Legal Fees and Expenses
 
     8. . (a) For the period following the Termination Date specified in Paragraph (3) of Annex A (the "Non-Competition Period"), subject to the Executive's receipt of benefits under Section 4, the Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, engage in any Competitive Activity.
Competitive Activity; Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation
          (b) During the Term, the Company agrees that it will disclose to Executive its confidential or proprietary information (as defined in this Section 8(b)) to the extent necessary for Executive to carry out Executive's obligations to the Company. The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, during the Term and two years thereafter disclose to any person not employed by the Company, or use in connection with engaging in competition with the Company, any confidential or proprietary information of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "confidential or proprietary information" will include all information of any nature and in any form that is owned by the Company and that is not publicly available (other than by Executive's breach of this Section 8(b)) or generally known to persons engaged in businesses similar or related to those of the Company. Confidential or proprietary information will include, without limitation, the Company's financial matters, customers, employees, industry contracts, strategic business plans, product development (or other proprietary product data), marketing plans, and all other secrets and all other information of a confidential or proprietary nature. For purposes of the preceding two sentences, the term "Company" will also include any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Restricted Group"). The obligations imposed by this Section 8(b) will not apply (i) during the Term, in the course of the business of and for the benefit of the Company, (ii) if such confidential or proprietary information has become, through no fault of the Executive, generally known to the public or (iii) if the Executive is required by law to make disclosure (after giving the Company notice and an opportunity to contest such requirement).
          (c) The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that for a period ending one year after the Termination Date Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent will not unreasonably be withheld as to Executive's personal assistant, on behalf of Executive or on behalf of any person, firm or company, directly or indirectly, attempt to influence, persuade or induce, or assist any other person in so persuading or inducing, any employee of the Restricted Group to give up, or to not commence, employment or a business relationship with the Restricted Group.
          (d) Executive and the Company agree that the covenants contained in this Section 8 are reasonable under the circumstances and subject to the provisions of Section 14 of this Agreement. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Company for breach of any of Executive's obligations under this Section 8 would be inadequate and that damages flowing from such a breach may not readily be susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Executive acknowledges, consents and agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law, in equity or under this Agreement, upon adequate proof of Executive's violation of any such provision of this Agreement, the Company will be
 
entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual damage.
     9. . Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will create any right or duty on the part of the Company or the Executive to have the Executive remain in the employment of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to or following any Change in Control.
Employment Rights
     10. . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company is required to withhold pursuant to any applicable law, regulation or ruling.
Withholding of Taxes
     11. . (a) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including without limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor will thereafter be deemed the "Company" for the purposes of this Agreement), but will not otherwise be assignable, transferable or delegable by the Company.
Successors and Binding Agreement
          (b) This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees and legatees.
          (c) This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties hereto will, without the consent of the other, assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except as expressly provided in Sections 11(a) and 11(b). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Executive's right to receive payments hereunder will not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest, or otherwise, other than by a transfer by Executive's will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 11(c), the Company will have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned, transferred or delegated.
     12. . For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications, including without limitation notices, consents, requests or approvals, required or permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by electronic facsimile transmission (with receipt thereof orally confirmed), or five business days after having been mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or three business days after having been sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service such as FedEx or UPS, addressed to the Company (to the attention of the
Notices
 
Secretary of the Company) at its principal executive office and to the Executive at Executive's principal residence, or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing and in accordance herewith, except that notices of changes of address will be effective only upon receipt.
     13. . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware and federal law, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws of such State, except as expressly provided herein. In the event the Company exercises its discretion under Section 8(d) to bring an action to enforce the covenants contained in Section 8 in a court of competent jurisdiction where the Executive has breached or threatened to breach such covenants, and in no other event, the parties agree that the court may apply the law of the jurisdiction in which such action is pending in order to enforce the covenants to the fullest extent permissible.
Governing Law
     14. . If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, including without limitation Section 8 hereof, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstance will not be affected, and the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal will be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable, valid or legal. If any covenant in Section 8 should be deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable because its time, geographical area, or restricted activity, is considered excessive, such covenant will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to render the modified covenant valid, legal and enforceable.
Validity
     15. . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto or compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party will be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, expressed or implied with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. The headings used in this Agreement are intended for convenience or reference only and will not in any manner amplify, limit, modify or otherwise be used in the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. References to Sections are to Sections of this Agreement. References to Paragraphs are to Paragraphs of an Annex to this Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement to a provision of a statute, rule or regulation will also include any successor provision thereto.
Miscellaneous
     16. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties' respective rights and obligations under Sections 3(c), 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11(b), 16 and 18 will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or the termination of the Executive's employment following a Change in Control for any reason whatsoever.
Survival
 
     17. . The Executive will be entitled to select (and change, to the extent permitted under any applicable law) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following the Executive's death, and may change such election, in either case by giving the Company written notice thereof in accordance with Section 12. In the event of the Executive's death or a judicial determination of the Executive's incompetence, reference in this Agreement to the "Executive" will be deemed, where appropriate, to the Executive's beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.
Beneficiaries
     18. . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
Counterparts
     19. . To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A. This Agreement will be administered in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause the Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A will have no force and effect until amended to comply with Section 409A (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A and may be made by the Company without the consent of the Executive). Prior to any Change in Control, the Company and the Executive will agree to any amendment of this Agreement approved by the Board based on the advice of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, LLP or any other nationally recognized law firm designated by the Board that such amendment, if implemented, is or is reasonably likely to reduce any adverse effect on the Company or the Executive of any rule, regulation or IRS interpretation of Section 409A and that such firm is recommending similar changes or provisions to its other clients that have change-in-control, severance or employment agreements or plans.
Section 409A
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
 
Annex A
     (1) A lump sum payment in an amount equal to two times the sum of (A) Base Pay (at the rate in effect for the year in which the Termination Date occurs), plus (B) Incentive Pay Target (or, if the Incentive Pay Target shall not have been established or shall be reduced after a Change in Control, the highest aggregate Incentive Pay Target as in effect for any of the three fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurred).
     (2) (A) For any Welfare Benefits that the Executive was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date (or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination or denial described in Section 1(1)(ii)) that are considered to be "reimbursement arrangements" covered under Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iv)(A) of the Code:
 
          (B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of the Agreement, for purposes of determining the period of continuation coverage to which the Executive or any of Executive's dependents is entitled pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code under the Company's medical, dental and other group health plans, or successor plans, the Executive's "qualifying event" will be the termination of the Continuation Period and the Executive will be considered to have remained actively employed on a full-time basis through that date, provided, however, that (1) with respect to health benefits the continuation period will in all events terminate on the 18-month anniversary of the termination date as so determined and (2) the Company will pay, or reimburse the Executive for, all COBRA continuation costs during such period.
          (C) For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence and for purposes of calculating service or age to determine the Executive's eligibility for welfare benefits, including benefits under any retiree medical benefits or life insurance plan or policy, the Executive will be considered to have remained actively employed on a full-time basis through the termination of the Continuation Period.
          (D) For any Welfare Benefits that the Executive was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date (or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination, or denial described in Section 1(1)(5)) that are not considered to be "reimbursement arrangements" covered under Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iv)(A) of the Code, the Company shall pay to the Executive, within the time period described in Section 4(a), in a lump sum, an amount equal to the present value of the continuation of such benefits for 18 months following the Termination Date.
          (E) Welfare Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Paragraph 2 will be reduced to the extent comparable Welfare Benefits are actually received by the Executive from another employer during the Continuation Period following the Executive's Termination Date, and any such Welfare Benefits actually received by the Executive will be reported by the Executive to the Company.
     (3) The Non-Competition Period contemplated by Section 8(a) will be 12 months from the Termination Date.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers
          On August 8, 2008, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") entered into an executive employment agreement substantially in the form of the Executive Employment Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this current report (the "Amended Executive Employment Agreement") with James P. McClure (Executive Vice President). On August 12, 2008, the Company entered into an Amended Executive Employment Agreement with James S. Lusk (Chief Financial Officer) and with Steven M. Zaccagnini (Executive Vice President). Messrs. Lusk, McClure and Zaccagnini are individually referred to herein as an "Executive". The Amended Executive Employment Agreement supersedes each Executive's prior employment agreement. The prior employment agreements for Messrs. McClure and Zaccagnini were scheduled to expire on October 31, 2008, and the prior employment agreement for Mr. Lusk was scheduled to expire on March 31, 2009.
          The initial term of the Amended Executive Employment Agreement will expire on October 31, 2010, and the term will automatically renew for consecutive one-year terms unless the Company provides notice not to renew. Each Executive will continue to receive their current base salary, equal to $434,700 for Messrs. Lusk and Zaccagnini, and $550,000 for Mr. McClure. In addition, under the terms of the Amended Executive Employment Agreement, each Executive is eligible to receive an annual cash bonus pursuant to the Company's Performance Incentive Program, to participate in the Company's 2006 Equity Incentive Program and to receive such perquisites as are generally provided to similarly situated executives of the Company.
          The Amended Executive Employment Agreement provides that the Company may terminate an Executive's employment without "Cause" (as defined in the Amended Executive Employment Agreement). Upon such a termination, an Executive's right to severance benefits will be governed by the terms of the Company's Severance Policy or any similar plan or policy of the Company as in effect from time to time that provides severance benefits upon a termination of employment. The Amended Executive Employment Agreement provides that if any amount or benefit to be paid to an Executive, whether pursuant to the Company's Severance Policy or otherwise, would create an obligation for an Executive to pay an excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (an "Excess Parachute Payment"), such payment will be reduced so that no portion of the payment constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment, unless such reduction would result in an Executive receiving an amount that is less than 90% of the amount of the severance payment, after taking into account all applicable taxes on such payment, including any excise taxes.
          The terms of the Amended Executive Employment Agreement provide that upon the termination of an Executive's employment for any reason, the Executive will refrain from competing with, or soliciting the employees or customers of the Company for one year following the termination of employment.

7.7 Agreement Not to Compete
     Sellers understand that Purchaser shall be entitled to protect and preserve the going concern value of the Business to the extent permitted by law and that Purchaser would not have entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of this Section 7.7 and, therefore, Sellers agree that for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Sellers will not (other than with respect to Permitted Services), directly or indirectly (including through Affiliates), (i) engage in a Competitive Business, (ii) own, manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of a Competitive Business, (iii) provide financing or other support for a Competitive Business, or (iv) be related or otherwise affiliated in any manner with any Person that is engaged in a Competitive Business.

In the event Sellers or their respective Affiliates acquire a Competitive Business, Sellers shall divest such Competitive Business by way of auction or other competitive bidding process, negotiation, sale or such other manner or divestiture as Sellers shall deem appropriate and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to do so within a period of six (6) months from the date of such acquisition.
(a)
Target Business
 
     Notwithstanding the definition of Permitted Services, and without intending to limit in any way the provisions of this Section 7.7, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Parent and its Affiliates shall not:
(b)
          (i) solicit, negotiate, bid for, enter into or perform, any Stand Alone Lighting Work or any contracts for Stand Alone Lighting Work;
          (ii) dedicate any of their respective personnel to performing solely Lighting Work, or hire any additional personnel solely for Lighting Work;
          (iii) use any Employees not hired by Purchaser to perform solely Lighting Work;
          (iv) hire any subcontractors, other than Purchaser and/or its Affiliates, to perform Lighting Work, except for Compelling Reasons; or
          (v) charge customers for Lighting Work or receive any compensation from customers for Lighting Work, separate and apart from compensation for Non-Lighting Work.
          For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and its Affiliates may, without being in violation of this Section 7.7, solicit, negotiate, bid for, enter into and perform Multi-Service Work so long as, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Parent and its Affiliates include (as a subcontractor, co-bidder, or otherwise) only Purchaser and/or its Affiliates for Lighting Work, except for Compelling Reasons. In addition, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, Parent and its Affiliates will use (as a subcontractor, co-bidder or otherwise) only Purchaser and/or its Affiliates for Lighting Work needed by Parent or its Affiliates (other than Permitted Services), except for Compelling Reasons.
     For a period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, Sellers and their Affiliates shall not solicit any Transferred Employees or otherwise affirmatively and intentionally induce any Transferred Employee or any other employees of Purchaser engaged in the Business to leave such employ for purposes of accepting a position with Sellers or their Affiliates.
(c)
     Sellers and Purchaser intend that the covenants contained in this Section 7.7 be construed as a series of separate covenants and Sellers acknowledge that the limitations as to time, geographic area and scope of activity set forth above are reasonable and do not impose a greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill and the Business to be acquired by Purchaser under this Agreement.
(d)
     Sellers acknowledge that, with respect to any Assumed Contract that is terminated by the customer thereunder as of or after the Closing or as to which the customer under such Assumed Contract does not permit Purchaser to continue the Business under such Assumed Contract, the provisions of this Section 7.7 prohibit, for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date, the Sellers and their Affiliates from providing services to such customer of the kind provided for in such terminated
(e)
 
Assumed Contract, whether or not requested by such customer, except with respect to Permitted Services.
     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is understood by the parties hereto and agreed that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to Section 9.2 and other remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the covenants contained in this Section 7.7, and each party hereto agrees that the other party shall be entitled to equitable relief, including the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach or attempted breach of such covenants. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court refuses to enforce any of the separate covenants contained in this Section 7.7, the unenforceable covenant will be considered eliminated from this Section 7.7 for the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants to be enforced.
(f)
     Nothing contained herein to the contrary shall prohibit Parent (or any of its Affiliates) from being acquired, through sale, merger or related transaction, by any entity which qualifies as, owns or operates or is affiliated with, a Competitive Business. Purchaser agrees that neither any such acquirer nor any of its Affiliates (other than Parent and its Affiliates in existence immediately prior to such acquisition) will be bound by the terms of this Section 7.7.

(a)
     With respect to any guarantees by Parent of Assumed Leases, all of which are set forth on Schedule 5.14 of Sellers Disclosure Schedule to be delivered not later than ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall promptly following Closing use commercially reasonable efforts to replace such guarantees with suitable equivalent guarantees, if required, of Purchaser or a subsidiary of Osram Sylvania Inc. pursuant to such Assumed Leases and use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly obtain a release of Parent with respect to all such guarantees; , , this Section 7.8(b) shall not apply with respect to any Assumed Lease as to which the respective landlord has not given its consent to the assignment thereof to Purchaser. To the extent a landlord has consented to the assignment of an Assumed Lease but the applicable guarantee has not been so replaced, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and
(b)
provided

hold harmless Sellers for any Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out of such guarantee for Purchaser's failure to perform the Assumed Liabilities under such Assumed Lease.

(c)
 
Sellers, the Neutral Accountant shall resolve any disagreement.

Such notice shall describe the nature of the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and will indicate the estimated amount, if practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee.
(a)
"Third Party Claim"
     The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in any Third Party Claim or, by giving written notice to the Indemnitee, in which notice the Indemnifying Party agrees that it will indemnify the Purchaser Group for any Indemnifiable Losses that may result from such Third Party Claim, to elect to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel approved by the Indemnitee (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the Indemnitee will cooperate in good faith in such defense at such Indemnitee's own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnitee to participate in such defense or settlement through counsel chosen by the Indemnitee, with the fees and expenses of such counsel borne by the Indemnitee unless under applicable standards of professional conduct a conflict may exist between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee in which event the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim which would lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee for which the Indemnitee is not indemnified hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party shall not have exercised its right to assume the defense, the Indemnitee shall assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel chosen by it and approved by the Indemnifying Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim, the cost of such participation to be at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of the Indemnitee to the extent that such fees and expenses relate to claims as to which indemnification is due hereunder. The Indemnitee shall not dispose of such action or enter into any monetary compromise or settlement for which indemnification is due hereunder without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
(b)
     Any Indemnitee having a claim under these indemnification provisions shall make a good faith effort to recover all losses, damages, costs and expenses from third party insurers of such Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies so as to reduce the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss hereunder; , , that such Indemnitee shall be entitled to make such indemnification claim in advance of the disposition of any such insurance claim and the pendency of such insurance claim shall not entitle the Indemnifying Party to delay performance of its indemnification claim

If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any third party (non-captive) insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other entity, the amount of such reduction (less any deductibles, self-retentions, costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection therewith) will promptly be paid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any indemnity payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party (non captive) insurer in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the indemnity payment relates; , , that (i) for purposes of this Agreement, payments made by a third party insurer administering claims under a fronting policy or any self-insurance program shall not be considered payments by a third party (non-captive) insurer, (ii) the Indemnifying Party will then be in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss, and (iii) until the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Indemnifiable Loss, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third party (non-captive) insurer on account of said indemnity payment is hereby made expressly subordinated and subjected in right of payment to the Indemnitee's rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination rights. Nothing in this Section 9.3(c) shall be construed to require any party hereto to obtain or maintain any insurance coverage.

For Immediate Release
a leading facility services contractor, today reported sales and other income of $930.6 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, up 34.7% from $690.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Operating profit for the third quarter of fiscal 2008 was $29.9 million compared to $16.1 million for the prior year third quarter. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, which includes the effects of discontinued operations, was $16.4 million ($0.32 per diluted share) for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, up 36.8% from $12.0 million ($0.24 per diluted share) for the prior year third quarter.
NEW YORK, NY  September 4, 2008  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM),
On August 29, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the operating assets of its Amtech Lighting Services business to Sylvania Lighting Services, a subsidiary of OSRAM SYLVANIA. Proceeds from the sale of the lighting business, as well as amounts anticipated to be realized over time from retained assets, primarily accounts receivable, are expected to yield approximately $70 million to $75 million for the Company. The Amtech Lighting Services business is presented as discontinued operations.
The Company's adjusted operating profit increased 37.1% to $28.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, from $21.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Adjusted operating profit excludes several items affecting comparability, including a benefit from the reduction in self-insurance reserves relating to prior years in the third quarter of fiscal 2008, partially offset by expenses associated with corporate initiatives and the integration of OneSource. (See "ABM Industries Incorporated Reconciliation of Operating Profit to Adjusted Operating Profit" in the accompanying financial tables.)
"During the third quarter, we continued to experience growth in revenue and operating profit in our janitorial, parking, security and engineering segments," said Henrik Slipsager, ABM's president and chief executive officer. "Despite weakness in certain regions and economic sectors, we achieved 4% organic growth in revenue, 86% growth in operating profit, due primarily to achieving $9.9 in million in cost-saving synergies with the acquisition of OneSource, and we reduced outstanding debt by approximately $17 million in the quarter. We also expect to achieve a further reduction in taxes paid of $3 million to $5 million beyond the $14 million in annual tax cost savings associated with the acquisition of OneSource. Our performance provides a clear measure of the success of our prior strategic actions to expand our geographic footprint and broaden our customer base, which has resulted in a stronger, more resilient company. With the
1
 
successful acquisition of OneSource, we are able to better capitalize on growth opportunities across all our segments and minimize the impact of economic slowing in any individual region."
Slipsager concluded, "We decided to sell our lighting business after careful consideration of the best use of our resources and its strategic fit with our long-term goals. We are pleased that this divestiture will allow us to focus on our core businesses and improve our return on assets."
The Company reported operating profit for the nine months ended July 31, 2008 of $73.7 million on sales and other income of $2.7 billion, compared to $53.1 million on sales and other income of $2.0 billion in the same period last year. Net income for the nine months ended July 31 2008, which includes the effects of discontinued operations, was $33.9 million ($0.66 per diluted share), compared to $37.4 million ($0.74 per diluted share) for the first nine months of fiscal 2007. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to higher interest costs in 2008, due to the OneSource acquisition, and the goodwill impairment charge related to Amtech Lighting Services recorded in the second quarter. Excluding items affecting comparability, the Company's adjusted operating profit increased 49.4% to $72.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2008 from $48.8 million in the same period last year. (See "ABM Industries Incorporated Reconciliation of Operating Profit to Adjusted Operating Profit" in the accompanying financial tables.)
Acknowledging a general decline in discretionary spending in some customer sectors and regions, the Company is narrowing its net income from continuing operations per diluted share guidance for fiscal year 2008 to $1.00 to $1.05, and expects adjusted net income from continuing operations per diluted share for fiscal of $1.10 to $1.15. The net income from continuing operations per diluted share guidance excludes the Amtech Lighting Services business, which is presented as discontinued operations.
Guidance
A reconciliation of the 2008 guidance of net income from continuing operations per diluted share to adjusted net income from continuing operations is included in the table below titled: "ABM Industries Incorporated 2008 Guidance Reconciliation of Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share to Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share."

In addition, the financial results reported in this release continue to be subject to adjustment until filing of the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2008. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the remainder of the year.

3
 
resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more of the Company's key executives that adversely affects customer retention or day-to-day management of the Company. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties the Company faces is contained in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K
and in other reports it files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, ABM has presented its third quarter operating profit for fiscal 2008 and 2007, and net income from continuing operations per diluted share for fiscal 2008 guidance, as adjusted, for items impacting comparability. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, adjusted operating profit and adjusted net income from continuing operations per diluted share is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating profit or net income from continuing operations per common share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

     2.1 Name. This Plan shall be known as the "ABM Industries Incorporated Executive Stock Option Plan".
     2.2 Purpose. The purpose of the Plan is to advance the interests of the Company and its shareholders by affording to Nonemployee Directors and to key management employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries an opportunity to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in the Company by the grant to such individuals of Options under the terms set forth herein. By thus encouraging such individuals to become owners of the Company shares, the Company seeks to motivate, retain, and attract those highly competent individuals upon whose judgment, initiative, leadership, and continued efforts the success of the Company in large measure depends.
     Any officer or other key management employee of the Company of its Subsidiaries shall be eligible to participate in the Plan. Prior to December 9, 2003, the Committee may grant Options to any eligible employee in accordance with such determinations as the Committee from time to time in its sole discretion shall make. Effective December 9, 2003, no additional Options shall be granted under the Plan. Each Nonemployee Director who both (1) is such on the date of the 1995 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and (2) does not hold an Option, automatically shall receive as of such date only, an Option to purchase 12,000 shares of Stock, but subject to Section 6.2 (regarding the ineligibility of
 
10 percent ((10%) holders). Each Nonemployee Director who becomes such after the 1995 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and prior to December 9, 2003, automatically shall receive, as of the date of his or her election or appointment to the Board, an Option to purchase 12,000 shares of Stock.
     4.1 Duties and Powers of Committee. The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall have the sole discretion and authority to determine from among eligible employee those to whom an the time or times at which the Options may be granted and the number of shares of Stock to be subject to each Option. Subject to the express provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall also have complete authority to interpret the Plan, to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to it, to determine the details and provisions of each Stock Option Agreement, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable in the administration of the Plan.
     4.2 Majority Rule. A majority of the members of the committee shall constitute a quorum, and any action taken by a majority present at a meeting at which a quorum is present or any action taken without a meeting evidenced by a writing executed by a majority of the whole Committee shall constitute the action of the Committee.
     4.3 Company Assistance. The Company shall supply fill and timely information to the Committee on all matters relating to eligible employees and Nonemployee Directors, their employment or service, death, retirement, disability or other termination of employment or service, and such other pertinent facts as the Committee may require. The Company shall furnish the Committee with such clerical and other assistance as is necessary in the performance of its duties.
     4.4 Beneficiary Designation. Optionees and their Beneficiaries may designate on the prescribed form one or more Beneficiaries to whom distribution shall be made of any vested Options outstanding at the time of the Optionee's or Beneficiary's death. An Optionee or Beneficiary may change such designation at any time by filing the prescribed form with the Committee or its designee. If a Beneficiary has not been designated or if no designated Beneficiary survives the Optionee or Beneficiary, distribution will be made to the residuary beneficiary under the terms of the Optionee's or Beneficiary's last will and testament or, in the absence of a last will and testament, to the Optionee's or Beneficiary's estate as beneficiary.
 
     5.1 Limitations. Subject to adjustment pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.3 hereof, the number of shares of Stock which may be issued and sold hereunder shall not exceed 2,360,000 shares. Such shares may be either authorized and unissued shares or shares issued and thereafter acquired by the Company.
     5.2 Options and Awards Granted Under Plan. Shares of Stock with respect to which an Option granted hereunder shall have been exercised shall not again be available for Options hereunder. If Options granted hereunder shall terminate for any reason without being wholly exercised, new Options may be granted hereunder for the number of shares to which such Option termination relates.
     5.3 Antidilution. In the event that the outstanding shares of Stock hereafter are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or other securities of the Company or of another corporation by reason of merger, consolidation, other reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination of shares, stock split-up or stock dividend:
(a) The aggregate number and kind of shares subject to Options which may be granted hereunder shall be adjusted appropriately;
(b) Rights under outstanding Options granted hereunder, both as to the number of subject shares and the Option price, shall be adjusted appropriately;
(c) Where dissolution or liquidation of the Company or any merger or combination in which the Company is not a surviving corporation is involved, each outstanding Option granted hereunder shall terminate, but the Optionee shall have the right, immediately prior to such dissolution, liquidation, merger, or combination, to exercise his Option in whole or in part, without regard to any time of exercise provisions.
     The foregoing adjustments and the manner of application of the foregoing provisions shall be determined solely the Committee, and any such adjustment may provide for the elimination of fractional share interests
     6.1 Option Grant and Agreement. Each Option granted hereunder shall be evidenced by minutes of a meeting or the written consent of the Committee and by a written Stock Option Agreement dated as of the date of grant and executed by the Company and the Optionee, which Agreement shall set forth such terms and conditions as my be determined by the Committee consistent with the Plan.
     6.2 Participant Limitation. The Committee shall not grant an Option to any individual for such number of shares of Stock that, immediately after the grant, the total number of shares of Stock owned or subject to all options exercisable at any time by such individual
 
exceed ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all Stock of the Company or its Subsidiaries. For this purpose an individual shall be considered as owning stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for his brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half blood), spouse, ancestors, and lineal descendents, and stock owned, directly or indirectly, by or for a corporation, partnership, estate, or trust shall be considered as being owned proportionately by or for its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries.
     6.3 Option Price. The per share Option price of the Stock subject to each Option shall be determined by the Committee, but the per share price shall not be less than the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the Option is granted. The per share Option price of the Stock subject to each Option granted to a Nonemployee Director shall equal 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the date the Option is granted.
     6.4 Period of Exercisablity. Subject to Sections 6.5 (a) and 6.7, the period during which each Option may be exercised shall be determined in accordance with the following rules. As to the first fifty percent (50%) of the shares covered by an Option, the Option may be exercised during the period commencing on the Optionee's Initial Vesting Date and ending one (1) year after the Optionee's termination of employment with the Company and all of its Subsidiaries (termination from the Board, in the case of Nonemployee Director).
     As to the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the shares covered by the Option, the Option may be exercised during the period commencing on the Optionee's Final Vesting Date and ending one (1) year after the Optionee's termination of employment with the Company and all of its Subsidiaries (termination from the Board, in the case of a Nonemployee Director).
     6.5 Option Exercise.
(a) Options granted hereunder may not be exercised unless the Optionee shall have remained in the employ of the Company or its Subsidiaries (on the Board in the case of a Nonemployee Director) until the applicable Vesting Date.
(b) Options may be exercised in whole or in part from time to time with respect to whole shares only, during such period for the exercise thereof, and shall be exercised by written notice of exercise with respect to a specified number of shares delivered to the Company at its headquarters office, and payment in full to the Company at said office of the amount of the Option price for the number of shares of Stock with respect to which the Option is exercised. In addition to and at the time of payment of the Option price, Optionee shall pay to the Company in cash the full amount of all the federal and/or state withholding taxes applicable to the taxable income of such Optionee resulting from such exercise.
     6.6 Nontransferability of Option. Options shall be exercisable, during the Optionee's lifetime, only by the Optionee. No Option or any right granted thereunder shall be
 
transferable by the Optionee by operation of law or otherwise, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Optionee may designate a Beneficiary to succeed, after the Optionee's death, to all of the Optionee's Options outstanding on the date of death.
     6.7 Effect of Change in Control on Options. In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing Company or other business entity or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiror") may, without the consent of any Optionee, either assume or continue the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Options or substitute for outstanding Options substantially equivalent options covering the Acquiror's stock. All options assumed or continued by the Acquiror in connection with a Change in Control will become fully vested and exercisable if, during the 12-month period following the Change in Control, the Optionee's employment is terminated without Cause or, in the case of a Nonemployee Director, the Optionee's service to the Company as a Director is terminated. Any Options that are neither assumed nor continued by the Acquiror in connection with the Change in Control shall, contingent on the Change in Control, become fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Change in Control.
     6.8 Effect of Termination of Employment or Service. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.7 above, if, prior to an Optionees applicable Vesting Date, the Optionee's employment or service shall be terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary with or without Cause, or by the act of the Optionee, the right to exercise such Option (or portion thereof) shall terminate and all rights thereunder shall cease.
     6.9 Rights as Stockholder. An Optionee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any shares subject to such Option prior to the purchase of such shares by exercise of such Option as provided herein.
 
     The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate for shares of Stock purchased upon the exercise of any Option granted hereunder prior to fulfillment of all the following conditions:
(a) The admission of such shares to listing on all stock exchanges on which the Stock is then listed;
(b) The completion of any registration or other qualification of such shares under any federal or state law or under the rulings or regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body, which the Committee shall in its sole discretion deem necessary or advisable;
(c) The obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any federal or state governmental agency which the Committee shall in its sole discretion determine to be necessary or advisable; and
(d) The lapse of such reasonable period of time following the exercise of the Option as the Committee from time to time may establish or approve for reasons of administrative convenience.
     The Board may at any time, or from time to time, amend or terminate the Plan in any respect, except that, to the extent required to maintain this Plan's qualification under Rule 16b-3, any amendment shall be subject to stockholder approval.
     9.1 No Effect on Employment or Service. Nothing in the Plan or in any Option granted hereunder or in any Stock Option Agreement shall confer upon any employee the right to continue as a member of the Board or in the employ of the Company or in any Subsidiary.
 
     9.2 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Stock pursuant to the exercise of Options shall be added to the Company's general funds and used for general corporate purposes.
     9.3 Effective Date. The effective date of this amendment and restatement of the Plan is January 11, 2005. The amendment and restatement of the Plan shall have no effect on the Options granted under the Plan prior to the amendment and restatement.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
today reported revenues of $905.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, a 31% increase over $691.4 million in the year-ago quarter. For the full fiscal year, ABM increased revenues by 34%, to $3.6 billion, compared to fiscal year 2007 revenues of $2.7 billion. Net income was $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with $15.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. Full-year net income was $45.4 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared to $52.4 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2007. Net income for fiscal year 2008 includes a $7.3 million loss, or $0.15 per diluted share, related to the Company's former Amtech Lighting Services business.
NEW YORK, NY  December 15, 2008  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $14.8 million compared to $14.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted income from continuing operations, which excludes items affecting comparability, increased 28% to $18.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $14.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year, the Company reported income from continuing operations of $52.7 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared to $50.6 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2007. Adjusted income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2008 increased 15% to $56.3 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared to fiscal year 2007 adjusted income from continuing operations of $48.8 million, or $0.96 per diluted share. Fiscal year 2008 results for both income from continuing operations and adjusted income from continuing operations were in line with guidance. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased to $25.8 million, up 7% over fourth quarter of 2007 operating profit of $24 million. Operating profit for fiscal year 2008 also rose, to $99.5 million, a 29% increase compared to fiscal year 2007 operating profit of $77.2 million.

The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $42.0 million, 52% higher than fourth quarter of 2007 adjusted EBITDA of $27.6 million. Fiscal year 2008 adjusted EBITDA grew by 46% to $133.4 million compared to $91.5 million for fiscal year 2007. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
"ABM produced strong operating results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year, despite one of the most historically challenging economic climates for doing business," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer of ABM Industries. "The Company's double-digit growth in revenues, operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for the full year demonstrates the strength of our businesses. We achieved 3% organic revenue growth in fiscal 2008, excluding OneSource revenues, even with economic deterioration in certain regions and sectors. Our acquisition of OneSource early in the fiscal year enabled us to achieve revenue growth of 34% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 46% for fiscal year 2008, which we believe is a clear indication of our successful integration of this strategic acquisition."
As previously announced, during the fourth quarter of 2008 the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the operating assets of its Amtech Lighting Services business to Sylvania Lighting Services, a subsidiary of OSRAM SYLVANIA. The proceeds already received from the sale of the lighting business, and amounts anticipated to be realized over time from retained assets, primarily receivables, are expected to total approximately $70 million to $75 million.
Slipsager continued: "Given economic and market conditions, we are conservatively managing resources and expenses. We lowered the Company's debt by $86 million, to $230 million, compared to the level at January 31, 2008. Operating cash flow from continuing operations improved by $4.7 million for the year, and by $15.1 million compared to the third quarter of 2008. We believe that the combination of continued growth in our core businesses, strong management of cash and operations and our unmatched national footprint in facility services will position us for improved results in fiscal year 2009, despite continued economic weakness."
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.13 per common share payable on February 2, 2009 to stockholders of record on January 8, 2009. This will be ABM's 171st consecutive quarterly cash dividend, and is $0.005, or 4%, above the $0.125 per share quarterly dividend declared and paid for the first quarter of 2008.
Guidance
In light of the uncertain economic environment, the Company is providing guidance for only the first half of fiscal year 2009. The Company expects income from continuing operations per diluted share in the range of $0.42 to $0.50 for the first half of fiscal year 2009 and, for the same period, adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share in the range of $0.46 to $0.54. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, we have presented fourth quarter and full-year income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 and 2007 and guidance for the first half of fiscal year 2009, as adjusted for items impacting comparability. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2008 and 2007. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)

Form of Change in Control Agreement with Henrik C. Slipsager, President and Chief Executive Officer , James S. Lusk, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, James P. McClure, Executive Vice President, and Steven M. Zaccagnini, Executive Vice President
     On December 30, 2008, the Company entered into a Change in Control Agreement (the "Agreement") with each Executive. The Agreement amends and restates each Executive's prior severance agreement (1) with respect to Messrs. Lusk, McClure and Zaccagnini, to reflect changes required to comply with the provisions of Sections 409A and 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and (2) with respect to each Executive, to amend the definition of "Cause" set forth in the Change in Control Agreement. Mr. Slipsager's prior severance agreement had been amended in July 2008 to reflect changes required to comply with Sections 409A and 162(m). A copy of the form of the Change in Control Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 to this current report and is incorporated herein by reference.

Exhibit 10.1
EXECUTION COPY
          This Amended and Restated Change in Control Agreement (formerly referred to as the Severance Agreement) (this "Agreement"), effective as of December 30, 2008, is made between ABM Industries Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and the individual executing this Agreement as the Executive on the signature page (the "Executive").
     A. The Executive is a senior executive of the Company and has made and is expected to continue to make major contributions to the short- and long-term profitability, growth and financial strength of the Company;
     B. The Company recognizes that the possibility of a Change in Control, as hereinafter defined, exists and that such possibility, and the uncertainty it may create among management, may result in the distraction or departure of management personnel, to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders, including a reduction of the value received by stockholders in a Change in Control transaction;
     C. The Executive and the Company are party to a Severance Agreement dated [insert applicable date] (the "Prior Agreement");
     D. The parties desire to amend and restate the Prior Agreement to reflect changes required to comply with Section 409A and Section 162(m) of the Code, to revise the definition of "Cause" set forth in the Prior Agreement, and to change the name of the Prior Agreement to the Change in Control Agreement;
     E. The Company desires to assure itself of both present and future continuity of management and to establish fixed severance benefits for certain of its senior executives, including the Executive, applicable in the event of a Change in Control; and
     F. The Company desires to provide additional inducement for the Executive to continue to remain in the employ of the Company. Accordingly, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:
     1. . In addition to terms defined elsewhere herein, the following terms have the following meanings when used in this Agreement with initial capital letters:
Certain Defined Terms
          (a) "After-Tax Amount" means the amount to be received by an Executive determined on an after-tax basis taking into account the excise tax imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code, or any successor provision thereto, any tax imposed by any comparable provision of state law and any applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes.
 
          (b) "Base Pay" means the Executive's annual base salary rate as in effect at the time a determination is required to be made under Section 4.
          (c) "Board" means the Board of Directors of the Company; any action of the Board herein contemplated will be valid if adopted by a majority of the total number of directors then in office or a majority of the Incumbent Directors and, for purposes of interpreting, amending or waiving any portion of this Agreement, may be adopted by a majority of the Incumbent Directors by written action, whether or not unanimous, or may be delegated by specific action of the Board of Directors after the date hereof to any directorate committee comprised solely of Incumbent Directors who are also Independent Directors.
          (d) "Cause" shall mean, with respect to the Executive: (i) the willful and continued failure to substantially perform the Executive's duties and responsibilities for reasons other than death or disability, after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to him/her by the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Company believes that the Executive has not substantially performed the Executive's duties; (ii) the Executive's conviction(or entry of a plea bargain admitting criminal guilt) of any felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (iii) intentional breach by the Executive of his/her fiduciary obligations to the Company or any securities laws applicable to the Company; or (iv) intentional wrongful engagement by the Executive in any Competitive Activity; and, for purposes of this subsection (iv), any such act shall have been demonstrably and materially harmful to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, no act or failure to act on the part of the Executive will be deemed "intentional" if it was due primarily to an error in judgment or negligence, but will be deemed "intentional" only if done or omitted to be done by the Executive not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the best interest of the Company.
          (e) "Change in Control" means that during the Term any of the following events occurs, provided that the occurrence of such event constitutes a "change in effective ownership or control" of the Company, as defined in Section 409A:

               (ii) a majority of the Board ceases to be comprised of Incumbent Directors; or
 
               (iii) the consummation of a reorganization, merger, consolidation, plan of liquidation or dissolution, recapitalization or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the acquisition of the stock or assets of another corporation, or other transaction (each, a "Business Transaction"), unless, in any such case, (A) no Person (other than the Company, any entity resulting from such Business Transaction or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company, any Subsidiary or such entity resulting from such Business Transaction) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 35% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding shares of Voting Stock of the entity resulting from such Business Transaction or, if it is such entity, the Company and (B) at least one-half of the members of the Board of Directors of the entity resulting from such Business Transaction were Incumbent Directors at the time of the execution of the initial agreement providing for such Business Transaction.
          (f) "Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

"Competitive Activity" will not include the mere ownership of securities in any such enterprise and the exercise of rights appurtenant thereto, if such ownership is less than 5% of the outstanding voting securities or units of such enterprise.
          (h) "Employee Benefits" means the benefits and service credit for benefits as provided under any and all employee retirement income and welfare benefit policies, plans, programs or arrangements in which the Executive is entitled to participate, including without limitation any stock option, performance share, performance unit, stock purchase, stock appreciation, savings, pension, supplemental executive retirement, or other retirement income or welfare benefit, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, group or other life, health, medical/hospital or other insurance (whether funded by actual insurance or self-insured by the Company or a Subsidiary), disability, salary continuation, expense reimbursement and other employee benefit policies, plans, programs or arrangements that may now exist or any equivalent successor policies, plans, programs or arrangements that may be adopted hereafter by the Company or a Subsidiary, providing benefits and service credit for benefits at least as great in the aggregate as are payable thereunder immediately prior to a Change in Control.

          (j) "Excess Parachute Payment" means a payment that creates an obligation for Executive to pay excise taxes under Section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto.

               (i) Failure to elect or reelect or otherwise to maintain the Executive in the office or the position he had with the Company immediately prior to a Change in Control, or a substantially equivalent or better office or position than that which he had with the Company immediately prior to the Change in Control, in either such case with the Company, any legal successor to the Company or, if the Company merges with or into another entity with substantial operations, with respect to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries substantially as conducted immediately prior to the Change in Control;
               (ii) Failure of the Company to remedy any of the following within 30 calendar days after receipt by the Company of written notice thereof from the Executive: (A) a significant adverse change in the nature or scope of the authorities, powers or functions attached to the position with the Company which the Executive held immediately prior to the Change in Control, (B) a material reduction in the Executive's Base Pay, (C) a material reduction in the Executive's Incentive Pay Opportunity or Incentive Pay Target, or (D) the termination or denial of the Executive's rights to material Employee Benefits or a material reduction in the scope or value thereof, unless such termination or reduction referred to in clauses (B), (C) or (D) applies on a substantially similar basis to all executives of the Company and its parent entities or such right is replaced with a right with a substantially similar scope or value;
               (iii) The liquidation, dissolution, merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company or the transfer of all or substantially all of its business and/or assets, unless the successor or successors (by liquidation, merger, consolidation, reorganization, transfer or otherwise) to which all or substantially all of its business and/or assets have been transferred (by operation of law or otherwise) assumed all duties and obligations of the Company under this Agreement pursuant to Section 11(a);
               (iv) If the Executive's principal residence at the time in question is within 35 miles of the Company's headquarters or the headquarters of the Subsidiary that is Executive's employer, the Company requires the Executive to have Executive's principal location of work changed to any location that is in excess of 50 miles from such residence without Executive's prior written consent; or
               (v) Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, any material breach of this Agreement or any Other Employment Agreement (as defined in Section 6) by the Company or any successor thereto which is not remedied by the
 
Company within 10 calendar days after receipt by the Company of written notice from the Executive of such breach.
A termination of employment by the Executive for one of the reasons set forth in clauses (i)  (v), above, will not constitute "Good Reason" unless, within the 60-day period immediately following the occurrence of such Good Reason event, the Executive has given written notice to the Company specifying in reasonable detail the event or events relied upon for such termination and the Company has not remedied such event or events within 30 days of the receipt of such notice. The Company and the Executive may mutually waive in writing any of the foregoing provisions with respect to an event or events that otherwise would constitute Good Reason.
          (m) "Incumbent Directors" means the individuals who, as of the date hereof, are Directors of the Company and any individual becoming a Director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, nomination for election by the Company's shareholders or appointment was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the then Incumbent Directors (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which such person is named as a nominee for director, without objection to such nomination); provided, however, that an individual shall not be an Incumbent Director if such individual's election or appointment to the Board occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest (as described in Rule 14a-12(c) of the Exchange Act) with respect to the election or removal of Directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board.

          (o) "Incentive Pay Opportunity" means the maximum amount of Incentive Pay that the Executive would receive pursuant to any Incentive Pay Plan in existence immediately prior to a Change in Control (disregarding the effects of the Change in Control, including without limitation increased depreciation or amortization, financing expense and transaction costs), assuming satisfaction of all thresholds or other conditions thereto established (i) prior to the Change in Control or (ii) after the Change in Control either (A) with the Executive's specific prior written approval or (B) by action of a committee of the Board comprised solely of Independent Directors.
          (p) "Incentive Pay Plan" means any plan, program, agreement or arrangement (excluding employee stock options, restricted stock or other rights the value of which is determined solely by reference to the value of the Company's common stock).
          (q) "Incentive Pay Target" means the amount or value of Incentive Pay the Executive would have received assuming that the Incentive Pay Plans in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control continue unchanged and are satisfied at the target level and, if applicable, any conditions to entitlement to payment at the target level
 
thereunder that are not measured by the Company's results of operation are satisfied at the target level.
          (r) "Independent Directors" means directors who qualify as "independent" directors under then-applicable New York Stock Exchange rules applicable to compensation committees (whether or not the Company's securities continue to be listed for trading thereon).

     2. . This Agreement will be effective and binding immediately upon its execution, but, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, except as provided in Section 3(c), this Agreement will not be operative unless and until a Change in Control occurs. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control at any time during the Term, without further action, this Agreement will become immediately operative.
Operation of Agreement
     3. . (a) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Executive's employment may be terminated by the Company during the Severance Period and the Executive will be entitled to the benefits provided by Section 4 unless such termination is the result of the occurrence of one or more of the following events:
Termination Following a Change in Control
               (i) The Executive's death;
               (ii) if the Executive becomes permanently disabled within the meaning of, and begins actually to receive disability benefits pursuant to, the long-term disability plan in effect for, or applicable to, the Executive immediately prior to the Change in Control; or
               (iii) Cause.
If, during the Severance Period, the Executive's employment is terminated by the Company other than pursuant to Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii) or 3(a)(iii), the Executive will be entitled to the benefits provided by Section 4, provided that such termination constitutes a "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A.
          (b) In the event of the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Executive may terminate employment with the Company during the Severance Period for Good Reason with the right to severance compensation as provided in Section 4 regardless of whether any other reason, other than Cause, for such termination exists or has occurred, including without limitation other employment.
          (c) Nothing in this Agreement will (i) be construed as creating an express or implied contract of employment, changing the status of Executive as an employee at will, giving Executive any right to be retained in the employ of the Company,
 
or giving Executive the right to any particular level of compensation or benefits or (ii) interfere in any way with the right of the Company to terminate the employment of the Executive at any time with or without Cause, subject in either case to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.
     4. . (a) If, following the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company terminates the Executive's employment during the Severance Period other than pursuant to Section 3(a)(i), 3(a)(ii) or 3(a)(iii), or if the Executive terminates Executive's employment pursuant to Section 3(b) (any such termination, a "Triggering Termination"), provided that such Triggering Termination constitutes a "separation from service" as defined in Section 409A, the Company will pay to the Executive the amounts described in Annex A within five business days after the Termination Date (subject to the provisions of Section 4(d) of this Agreement) and will continue to provide to the Executive the benefits described in Annex A for the periods described therein.
Severance Compensation
          (b) Without limiting the rights of the Executive at law or in equity, if the Company fails to make any payment or provide any benefit required to be made or provided hereunder on a timely basis, the Company will pay interest on the amount or value thereof at an annualized rate of interest equal to the "prime rate" as set forth from time to time during the relevant period in The Wall Street Journal "Money Rates" column, plus 200 basis points, compounded monthly, or, if less, the maximum rate legally allowed. Such interest will be payable as it accrues on demand. Any change in such prime rate will be effective on and as of the date of such change.
          (c) Unless otherwise expressly provided by the applicable plan, program or agreement, after the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company will pay in cash to the Executive a lump sum amount equal to the sum of (i) any unpaid Incentive Pay that has been earned, accrued, allocated or awarded to the Executive for any performance period that by its terms as in effect prior to a Triggering Termination has been completed (any such period, a "Completed Performance Period") (regardless of whether payment of such compensation would otherwise be contingent on the continuing performance of services by the Executive) and (ii) the Pro Rata Portion of the Incentive Pay Target in effect for any subsequent performance period. For this purpose, "Pro Rata Portion" means (x) the number of days from and including the first day immediately following the last day of the immediately preceding Completed Performance Period to and including the Termination Date, divided by (y) the total number of days in such subsequent performance period. Such payments will be made at the earlier of (x) the date prescribed for payment pursuant to the applicable plan, program or agreement and (y) within five business days after the Termination Date, and will be payable and calculated disregarding any otherwise applicable vesting requirements.
          (d) To the extent required in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement during the six-month period immediately following the Executive's termination of employment shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six months following the Executive's
 
termination of employment (or upon the Executive's death, if earlier). In addition, for purposes of this Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Section 409A, and any payments described in Annex A that are due within the "short term deferral period" as defined in Section 409A shall not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise.
     5. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or any Other Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement or any Other Agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment (including after taking into account the value, to the maximum extent permitted by Section 280G of the Code, of the covenants in Section 8 hereof), but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement and any Other Agreement will be reduced to the minimum extent necessary (but in no event to less than zero) so that no portion of any such payment or benefit, as so reduced, constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided, however, that the foregoing reduction will not be made if such reduction would result in Executive receiving an After-Tax Amount less than 90% of the After-Tax Amount of the severance payments he or she would have received under Section 4 or under any Other Agreement without regard to this clause. Whether requested by the Executive or the Company, the determination of whether any reduction in such payments or benefits to be provided under this Agreement or otherwise is required pursuant to the preceding sentence, and the value to be assigned to the Executive's covenants in Section 8 hereof for purposes of determining the amount, if any, of the Excess Parachute Payment will be made at the expense of the Company by the Company's independent accountants or benefits consultant. The fact that the Executive's right to payments or benefits may be reduced by reason of the limitations contained in this Section 5 will not of itself limit or otherwise affect any other rights of the Executive pursuant to this Agreement or any Other Agreement. In the event that any payment or benefit intended to be provided is required to be reduced pursuant to this Section 5, the Executive will be entitled to designate the payments and/or benefits to be so reduced in order to give effect to this Section 5, provided, however, that payments that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A shall be reduced first. The Company will provide the Executive with all information reasonably requested by the Executive to permit the Executive to make such designation. In the event that the Executive fails to make such designation within 10 business days after receiving notice from the Company of a reduction under this Section 5, the Company may effect such reduction in any manner it deems appropriate.
Limitations on Payments and Benefits
     6. . (a) The Company hereby acknowledges that it will be difficult and may be impossible for the Executive to find reasonably comparable employment following the Termination Date. Accordingly, the payment of the severance compensation by the Company to the Executive in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is hereby acknowledged by the Company to be reasonable, and the Executive will not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, nor will any profits, income, earnings or other benefits from any source whatsoever create any
No Mitigation Obligation; Other Agreements
 
mitigation, offset, reduction or any other obligation on the part of the Executive hereunder or otherwise, except as expressly provided in Paragraph 2(E) of Annex A.
          (b) A termination of employment pursuant to Section 3(a), 3(b) or 3(c) will not affect any rights that the Executive may have pursuant to any agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement of the Company or Subsidiary providing Employee Benefits, which rights will be governed by the terms thereof. To the extent that the Executive receives payments by reason of his or her termination of employment pursuant to any other employment or severance agreement or employee plan (collectively, "Other Employment Agreements"), the amounts otherwise receivable under Section 4 will be reduced by the amounts actually paid pursuant to the Other Employment Agreements, but not below zero, to avoid duplication of payments so that the total amount payable or value of benefits receivable hereunder and under the Other Employment Agreements is not less than the amounts so payable or value so receivable had such benefits been paid in full hereunder.
     7. . It is the intent of the Company that the Executive not be required to incur legal fees and the related expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Executive's rights in connection with any dispute arising under this Agreement because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Executive hereunder. Accordingly, if it should appear to the Executive that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any proceeding designed to deny, or to recover from, the Executive the benefits provided or intended to be provided to the Executive hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain counsel of Executive's choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to advise and represent the Executive in connection with any such dispute or proceeding. Without respect to whether the Executive prevails, in whole or in part, in connection with any of the foregoing, the Company will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all reasonable attorneys' and related fees and expenses incurred by the Executive in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that, in regard to such matters, the Executive has not acted in bad faith or with no colorable claim of success. The Executive shall promptly submit a written request for reimbursement of such expenses, but in no event later than ninety days following the date on which such expenses were incurred, accompanied by such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as the Company may reasonably require, and such reimbursements will be made within thirty business days after delivery of the Executive's written requests for payment.
Legal Fees and Expenses
     8. . (a) For the period following the Termination Date specified in Paragraph (3) of Annex A (the "Non-Competition Period"), subject to the Executive's receipt of benefits under Section 4, the Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, engage in any Competitive Activity.
Competitive Activity; Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation
 
          (b) During the Term, the Company agrees that it will disclose to Executive its confidential or proprietary information (as defined in this Section 8(b)) to the extent necessary for Executive to carry out Executive's obligations to the Company. The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, during the Term and two years thereafter disclose to any person not employed by the Company, or use in connection with engaging in competition with the Company, any confidential or proprietary information of the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "confidential or proprietary information" will include all information of any nature and in any form that is owned by the Company and that is not publicly available (other than by Executive's breach of this Section 8(b)) or generally known to persons engaged in businesses similar or related to those of the Company. Confidential or proprietary information will include, without limitation, the Company's financial matters, customers, employees, industry contracts, strategic business plans, product development (or other proprietary product data), marketing plans, and all other secrets and all other information of a confidential or proprietary nature. For purposes of the preceding two sentences, the term "Company" will also include any Subsidiary (collectively, the "Restricted Group"). The obligations imposed by this Section 8(b) will not apply (i) during the Term, in the course of the business of and for the benefit of the Company, (ii) if such confidential or proprietary information has become, through no fault of the Executive, generally known to the public or (iii) if the Executive is required by law to make disclosure (after giving the Company notice and an opportunity to contest such requirement).
          (c) The Executive hereby covenants and agrees that for a period ending one year after the Termination Date Executive will not, without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent will not unreasonably be withheld as to Executive's personal assistant, on behalf of Executive or on behalf of any person, firm or company, directly or indirectly, attempt to influence, persuade or induce, or assist any other person in so persuading or inducing, any employee of the Restricted Group to give up, or to not commence, employment or a business relationship with the Restricted Group.
          (d) Executive and the Company agree that the covenants contained in this Section 8 are reasonable under the circumstances and subject to the provisions of Section 14 of this Agreement. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law available to the Company for breach of any of Executive's obligations under this Section 8 would be inadequate and that damages flowing from such a breach may not readily be susceptible to being measured in monetary terms. Accordingly, Executive acknowledges, consents and agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Company may have at law, in equity or under this Agreement, upon adequate proof of Executive's violation of any such provision of this Agreement, the Company will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and may obtain a temporary order restraining any threatened or further breach, without the necessity of proof of actual damage.
     9. . Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement will create any right or duty on the part of the Company or the Executive to have the Executive remain in the employment of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to or following any Change in Control.
Employment Rights
 
     10. . The Company may withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement all federal, state, city or other taxes as the Company is required to withhold pursuant to any applicable law, regulation or ruling.
Withholding of Taxes
     11. . (a) The Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including without limitation any persons acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor will thereafter be deemed the "Company" for the purposes of this Agreement), but will not otherwise be assignable, transferable or delegable by the Company.
Successors and Binding Agreement
          (b) This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees and legatees.
          (c) This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties hereto will, without the consent of the other, assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except as expressly provided in Sections 11(a) and 11(b). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Executive's right to receive payments hereunder will not be assignable, transferable or delegable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest, or otherwise, other than by a transfer by Executive's will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 11(c), the Company will have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned, transferred or delegated.
     12. . For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications, including without limitation notices, consents, requests or approvals, required or permitted to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by electronic facsimile transmission (with receipt thereof orally confirmed), or five business days after having been mailed by United States registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or three business days after having been sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service such as FedEx or UPS, addressed to the Company (to the attention of the Secretary of the Company) at its principal executive office and to the Executive at Executive's principal residence, or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing and in accordance herewith, except that notices of changes of address will be effective only upon receipt.
Notices
     13. . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware and federal law, without giving effect to the
Governing Law
 
principles of conflict of laws of such State, except as expressly provided herein. In the event the Company exercises its discretion under Section 8(d) to bring an action to enforce the covenants contained in Section 8 in a court of competent jurisdiction where the Executive has breached or threatened to breach such covenants, and in no other event, the parties agree that the court may apply the law of the jurisdiction in which such action is pending in order to enforce the covenants to the fullest extent permissible.
     14. . If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, including without limitation Section 8 hereof, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to any other person or circumstance will not be affected, and the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal will be reformed to the extent (and only to the extent) necessary to make it enforceable, valid or legal. If any covenant in Section 8 should be deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable because its time, geographical area, or restricted activity, is considered excessive, such covenant will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to render the modified covenant valid, legal and enforceable.
Validity
     15. . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto or compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party will be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, expressed or implied with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. The headings used in this Agreement are intended for convenience or reference only and will not in any manner amplify, limit, modify or otherwise be used in the construction or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement. References to Sections are to Sections of this Agreement. References to Paragraphs are to Paragraphs of an Annex to this Agreement. Any reference in this Agreement to a provision of a statute, rule or regulation will also include any successor provision thereto.
Miscellaneous
     16. . Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the parties' respective rights and obligations under Sections 3(c), 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11(b), 16 and 18 will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or the termination of the Executive's employment following a Change in Control for any reason whatsoever.
Survival
     17. . The Executive will be entitled to select (and change, to the extent permitted under any applicable law) a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or benefit payable hereunder following the Executive's death, and may change such election, in either case by giving the Company written notice thereof in accordance with Section 12. In the event of the Executive's death or a judicial determination of the Executive's incompetence, reference in this Agreement to the "Executive" will be deemed, where appropriate, to the Executive's beneficiary, estate or other legal representative.
Beneficiaries
 
     18. . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same agreement.
Counterparts
     19. . To the extent applicable, it is intended that this Agreement comply with the provisions of Section 409A. This Agreement will be administered in a manner consistent with this intent, and any provision that would cause the Agreement to fail to satisfy Section 409A will have no force and effect until amended to comply with Section 409A (which amendment may be retroactive to the extent permitted by Section 409A and may be made by the Company without the consent of the Executive). Prior to any Change in Control, the Company and the Executive will agree to any amendment of this Agreement approved by the Board based on the advice of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, LLP or any other nationally recognized law firm designated by the Board that such amendment, if implemented, is or is reasonably likely to reduce any adverse effect on the Company or the Executive of any rule, regulation or IRS interpretation of Section 409A and that such firm is recommending similar changes or provisions to its other clients that have change-in-control, severance or employment agreements or plans.
Section 409A
 
EXECUTION COPY
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed and delivered as of the date first above written.
 
Annex A
     (1) A lump sum payment in an amount equal to two times the sum of (A) Base Pay (at the rate in effect for the year in which the Termination Date occurs), plus (B) Incentive Pay Target (or, if the Incentive Pay Target shall not have been established or shall be reduced after a Change in Control, the highest aggregate Incentive Pay Target as in effect for any of the three fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which the Change in Control occurred).
     (2) (A) For any Welfare Benefits that the Executive was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date (or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination or denial described in Section 1(1)(ii)) that are considered to be "reimbursement arrangements" covered under Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iv)(A) of the Code:
 
     (B) Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of the Agreement, for purposes of determining the period of continuation coverage to which the Executive or any of Executive's dependents is entitled pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code under the Company's medical, dental and other group health plans, or successor plans, the Executive's "qualifying event" will be the termination of the Continuation Period and the Executive will be considered to have remained actively employed on a full-time basis through that date, provided, however, that (1) with respect to health benefits the continuation period will in all events terminate on the 18-month anniversary of the termination date as so determined and (2) the Company will pay, or reimburse the Executive for, all COBRA continuation costs during such period.
     (C) For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence and for purposes of calculating service or age to determine the Executive's eligibility for welfare benefits, including benefits under any retiree medical benefits or life insurance plan or policy, the Executive will be considered to have remained actively employed on a full-time basis through the termination of the Continuation Period.
     (D) For any Welfare Benefits that the Executive was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to the Termination Date (or, if greater, immediately prior to the reduction, termination, or denial described in Section 1(1)(5)) that are not considered to be "reimbursement arrangements" covered under Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iv)(A) of the Code, the Company shall pay to the Executive, within the time period described in Section 4(a), in a lump sum, an amount equal to the present value of the continuation of such benefits for 18 months following the Termination Date.
     (E) Welfare Benefits otherwise receivable by the Executive pursuant to this Paragraph 2 will be reduced to the extent comparable Welfare Benefits are actually received by the Executive from another employer during the Continuation Period following the Executive's Termination Date, and any such Welfare Benefits actually received by the Executive will be reported by the Executive to the Company.
   (3) The Non-Competition Period contemplated by Section 8(a) will be 12 months from the Termination Date.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          On January 20, 2009, ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") and International Business Machines Corporation (the "Supplier"), entered into a binding Memorandum of Understanding (the "MOU") pursuant to which ABM and Supplier agreed to: (i) terminate certain Services currently provided by Supplier to ABM under the Master Professional Services Agreement dated October 1, 2006 (the "Agreement"); (ii) transition the Terminated Services (as hereinafter defined) to ABM and/or its designee; (iii) resolve certain other disputes arising under the Agreement; and (iv) modify certain terms applicable to Services that Supplier will continue to provide ABM. Capitalized terms used in this Current Report on Form 8-K that are not otherwise defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement. The Agreement was previously filed as Exhibit 10.36 to ABM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006.
Terminated Services
          Contemporaneous with the execution of the MOU, ABM delivered a notice to Supplier terminating for convenience (the "Termination"), effective immediately, the following Functional Service Areas (collectively, the "Terminated Services"):
          In connection with the Termination, ABM agreed to pay Supplier the following Termination Charges:
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, ABM may direct Supplier to continue to provide certain of the Terminated Services until the date on which the transition of the Terminated Services is expected to be completed (such dates ranging from February 15, 2009 through August 1, 2009 depending upon the service being terminated), and ABM shall pay the Charges specified in the Transition Agreement (as hereinafter defined) or, if the Transition Agreement has not yet been executed, the Charges it would have been obligated to pay under the Agreement had the Terminated Services not been terminated by the MOU. ABM may also direct Supplier to continue to provide Terminated Services after the dates on which the transition of the Terminated Services are expected to be completed, provided that: (i) such extension shall not exceed six months; (ii) Application Management Services will be provided by Supplier for the applicable Charges specified in the existing Agreement; and (iii) for all other Terminated Services, ABM shall be charged on a time and materials basis at the rates and Charges specified in Section 4.3(b)(9) of the Agreement. In addition to the extension of certain Termination Services described above, Supplier has also agreed to provide certain Termination Assistance Services on a time and materials basis at the rates and Charges specified in Section 4.3(b)(9) of the Agreement.
Transition Agreement; Amended Agreement
          In connection with the termination of the Terminated Services, ABM and Supplier have agreed to use all commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement (the "Transition Agreement"), on or before January 30, 2009, which memorializes the applicable terms of the MOU as well as any other terms applicable to the termination of the Terminated Services. Notwithstanding the Termination, beginning March 1, 2009, Supplier will provide certain data center services to ABM. ABM and Supplier have also agreed to use all commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an amendment to the Agreement (the "Amended Agreement"), on or before January 30, 2009, which will set forth the Base Charges, ARC/RRC Rates and Service Levels applicable to the new data center services.
Table of Contents
          Upon execution, each of the Transition Agreement and the Amended Agreement shall supersede the MOU in pertinent part and, upon the execution of both agreements, the MOU will be of no further force and effect.
Mutual Settlement and Release Agreement
          Contemporaneous with the execution of the MOU, ABM and Supplier entered into a Mutual Settlement and Release Agreement in which each party agreed to release the other from all claims, known and unknown, relating to the Agreement and arising on or before December 31, 2008.

Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
551 Fifth Avenue Suite 300 New York, NY 10176
For Immediate Release
today reported revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 of $887.5 million compared to first quarter fiscal year 2008 revenues of $887.8 million. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $14.2 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, a 123% increase over $6.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was the highest first quarter net income in the Company's history.
NEW YORK, NY  March 2, 2009  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $14.8 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, an increase of 135% compared to $6.3 million, or $.0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Adjusted income from continuing operations, which excludes items affecting comparability, increased 63% to $13.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 compared to $8.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Items affecting comparability showed, in total, a net gain of $1.8 million after tax, or $0.04 per diluted share, from the $5.8 million after tax benefit of a settlement with a former third-party administrator of workers' compensation claims, partially offset by $4.0 million after tax of costs relating to corporate initiatives which are expected to conclude by the end of 2009. Both income from continuing operations and adjusted income from continuing operations were the highest first quarter totals ever recorded by the Company. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Operating profit for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 increased to $26.0 million, up 73% over the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 operating profit of $15.0 million. First quarter of fiscal year 2009 operating profit also was the highest recorded by the Company for the first quarter.
 
"We are very pleased with the strength of our performance, particularly given the pressures on our customer base in this economy," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer of ABM Industries. "While our revenues continue to be affected by the weak economic climate, our earnings remain strong as we further improve our operating efficiencies and profitability through aggressive cost containment, synergies from the OneSource acquisition and eliminating less profitable business. As a result, all of our core businesses  janitorial, engineering, parking and security  grew their operating profits compared to the year-ago quarter, and the integration of OneSource continues to drive profitability."
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $30.3 million, 27% higher than first quarter of fiscal year 2008 adjusted EBITDA of $23.8 million. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $26.1 million compared to net cash used of $24.9 million in the year-ago quarter, representing a net improvement of $51 million. Additionally, the Company reduced its net debt by $14 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.13 per common share payable on May 4, 2009 to stockholders of record on April 9, 2009. This will be ABM's 172 consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
nd
Guidance
In light of first quarter results, the Company is improving its guidance for the first half of fiscal year 2009. The Company now expects income from continuing operations per diluted share in the range of $0.48 to $0.52 for the first half of fiscal year 2009 and, for the same period, adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share in the range of $0.52 to $0.56. Full-year estimates remain difficult, given the challenging and uncertain market environment. The Company's estimate for the full fiscal year 2009 is income from continuing operations per diluted share in the range of $1.10 to $1.20 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, in the range of $1.25 to $1.35. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)

In addition, the financial results reported in this release continue to be subject to adjustment until filing of the Company's quarterly report on
Form 10-Q

These factors include but are not limited to: (1) a slowdown in the Company's acquisition activity, diversion of management focus from operations as a result of acquisitions or failure to timely realize anticipated cost savings and synergies from acquisitions; (2) functional delays and resource constraints related to the Company's transition to new information technology systems; (3) unanticipated costs associated with the transition of certain IT services from IBM to third-party vendors or associated with providing those services internally, and service disruptions or the failure or delay of certain projects relating to the Company's IT platforms and systems occasioned by such transition; (4) resource constraints relating to the support of multiple concurrent projects or the inability to complete certain projects on schedule; (5) disruption in functions affected by the transition to Shared Services Centers; (6) the inability to collect accounts receivable retained by the Company in connection with the sale of its lighting business; (7) changes in estimated claims or in the frequency or severity of claims against the Company, deterioration in claims management, cancellation or non-renewal of the Company's primary insurance policies or changes in the Company's customers' insurance needs; (8) increase in debt service requirements; (9) further declines in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates relating to a deepening of the current recession; (10) the inability of customers to access the credit markets impacting the Company's ability to collect receivables; (11) labor disputes leading to a loss of sales or expense variations; (12) loss of long-term customers or financial difficulties or bankruptcy of a major customer or multiple customers; (13) intense competition that lowers revenue or reduces margins; (14) an increase in costs that the Company cannot pass on to customers; (15) natural disasters or acts of terrorism that disrupt the Company in providing services; (16) events or circumstances that may result in impairment of goodwill recognized on the OneSource or other acquisitions; (17) significant accounting and other control costs that reduce the Company's profitability; and (18) the unfavorable outcome in one or more of the several class and representative action lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims. Other issues and uncertainties may include: unanticipated adverse jury determinations, judicial rulings or other developments in litigation to which the Company is
 
subject, new accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies, changes in U.S. immigration law that raise the Company's administration costs, labor shortages that adversely affect the Company's ability to employ entry level personnel, legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally impacts the Company's expenses or reduces sales by adversely affecting the Company's customers, a reduction or revocation of the Company's line of credit that increases interest expense and the cost of capital; and the resignation, termination, death or disability of one or more of the Company's key executives that adversely affects customer retention or day-to-day management of the Company. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties the Company faces is contained in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K/A
and in other reports it files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, we have presented first quarter income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 and guidance for the first half and full year of fiscal year 2009, as adjusted for items impacting comparability. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, we have presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the first quarter of fiscal years 2009 and 2008. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

As noted above, the year-over-year comparison reflects a $7.2 million benefit ($4.4 million after-tax) in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 resulting from the reduction in self-insurance reserves relating to prior years. Adjusted income from continuing operations, which excludes items affecting comparability, increased to $16.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 compared to $14.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $36.1 million compared to $32.7 million in the year-ago quarter. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
 
"Our growth in net income and adjusted EBITDA reflects the focused actions we have taken to contain costs, preserve cash and maintain or increase operating margins," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer of ABM Industries Incorporated. "We are proactively working with our clients to help them meet their cost pressures and, at the same time, aggressively managing our own bottom line and credit risk by scaling back or eliminating less profitable contracts. While these measures contributed to modestly lower revenues, we are improving our profit margins and serving a healthier, stronger client base. We also are generating strong operating cash flow and effectively managing our working capital across the business. These actions should continue to leave us well positioned when the U.S. economy rebounds."
The Company reported net income for the six months ended April 30, 2009 of $27.0 million, an increase of 54.8% compared to $17.4 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2008. Earnings per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal year 2009 increased 52.9% to $0.52 per diluted share compared to $0.34 per diluted share in the first half of fiscal year 2008. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2009 increased to $27.8 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $21.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2008. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal year 2009 was $29.4 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $22.0 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2008. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Key financial information for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 is presented below.
 
 
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a third quarter cash dividend of $0.13 per common share payable on August 3, 2009 to stockholders of record on July 2, 2009. This will be ABM's 173 consecutive quarterly cash dividend.

To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, the Company has presented income from continuing operations for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal years 2009 and 2008 and guidance for fiscal year 2009, as adjusted for items impacting comparability. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal years 2009 and 2008.

PRESS RELEASE
(See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)

Net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $12.3 million, a 25.2% decrease from $16.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 included a $2.2 million after-tax insurance expense related to prior years compared to a $4.6 million after-tax insurance benefit related to prior years in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 decreased 25.0% to $0.24 compared to third quarter of fiscal year 2008 earnings per diluted share of $0.32.
NEW YORK, NY  September 2, 2009  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
 
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $12.4 million ($0.24 per diluted share) compared to $16.3 million ($0.32 per diluted share) in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. Adjusted income from continuing operations increased to $18.7 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, which excludes the $2.2 million after-tax insurance expense noted above and approximately $3 million after-tax costs related to the closing stages of the corporate initiatives which began in 2007. This compares to $15.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, which excludes a net $0.5 million benefit from items impacting comparability. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $37.8 million compared to $35.0 million in the year-ago quarter. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
"We continue to deliver strong results from our operating divisions," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer of ABM Industries Incorporated. "I am pleased that revenues in our third quarter increased slightly over the second quarter as we start to see signs of an improving economy. Combined, our operating divisions increased profits and margins, driven by aggressive cost controls. Adjusted income from continuing operations increased 18% for the quarter and adjusted EBITDA, a key measure of the strength of our operations, was up 8% year-over-year for the third quarter and nearly 14% for the first nine months of the fiscal year." (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Slipsager added: "We also continue to generate strong operating cash flow across the business. Net cash from operations increased to approximately $77 million through the first nine months of the year, which helped support our acquisition of facility services assets from Control Holding Group during the quarter. Additionally, we continue to reduce borrowings under our line of credit, net of acquisitions. These ongoing aggressive steps to improve profitability and generate cash from operations strongly position the Company for a rebound in the U.S economy."
The Company reported net income for the nine months ended July 31, 2009 of $39.3 million, an increase of 16.0% compared to $33.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2008. Earnings per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal year 2009 increased 15.2% to $0.76 per diluted share compared to $0.66 per diluted share in the first nine months of fiscal year 2008. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2009 increased to $40.2 million ($0.78 per diluted share) compared to $37.9 million ($0.74 per diluted share) for the first nine months of fiscal year 2008. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2009 was $48.0 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared to $37.7 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2008. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.13 per common share payable on November 2, 2009 to stockholders of record on October 8, 2009. This will be ABM's 174consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
th
Guidance
The Company now estimates that full fiscal year 2009 income from continuing operations per diluted share will be in the range of $1.05 to $1.15, which takes into consideration the unanticipated impact of the insurance expense related to prior years. The Company is reaffirming its guidance for fiscal year 2009 adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, which it expects will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.35. (See
 
accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such person's conduct was unlawful.
Section 7.1. Actions, Suits or Proceedings Other Than by or in the Right of the Corporation.
provided
however
 
The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was or has agreed to become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against costs, charges, expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action, suit or proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such costs, charges and expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper; , , that the foregoing indemnity shall not be applicable as to any person who is or was or agreed to become an employee or agent of the Corporation (other than employees or agents who also are or were or agreed to be officers or directors of the Corporation), or is or was serving or agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, (other than employees or agents who also are or were or agreed to be officers or directors of any such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan), unless and until such indemnity is specifically approved by the Board of Directors.
Section 7.2. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation.
provided
however
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article (including, without limitation, Section 7.4), to the extent that a present or former director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article), of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including, without limitation, the dismissal of an action without prejudice, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against all costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.
Section 7.3. Indemnification for Costs, Charges and Expenses of Successful Party.
 
Any indemnification under Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be paid by the Corporation unless a determination is made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of the quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders, that indemnification of the director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article) is not proper in the circumstances because he has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this Article.
Section 7.4. Determination of Right to Indemnification.
To the extent permitted by law, costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a person referred to in Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate; , , that the payment of such costs, charges and expenses incurred by a director or officer in his capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer) in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
Section 7.5. Advance of Costs, Charges and Expenses.
provided
however
Any indemnification under Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 of this Article or payment with respect to a claim under Section 7.5 of this Article shall be made promptly, and in any event within 30 days, upon the written request of the director, officer, employee or agent. The right to indemnification or advancement of costs, charges and expenses as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 of this Article or seeking advancement pursuant to Section 7.5 of this Article) in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition is made within 30 days. Any determination under Section 7.4 of this Article that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of care shall not bar the right of the claimant to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the right to indemnification granted by this Article. The Corporation shall indemnify such persons against costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification or advancement of costs, charges and expenses, in whole or in part, in any such action. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 7.5 of this Article) that the claimant has not, as provided in Section 7.4, met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) under Section 7.4 of this Article that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct , shall create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Section 7.6. Procedure for Indemnification.
 
The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office or while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article), and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of such person. All rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this Article shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article) of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Article or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to such director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article), or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder.
Section 7.7. Other Rights; Continuation of Right to Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
The Corporation shall purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him or on his behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article, provided that such insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be made by a vote of a majority of the Entire Board.
Section 7.8. Insurance.
If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee and agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.
Section 7.9. Savings Clause.
 
The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Section 8.1. Fiscal Year.
The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation, the year of its organization, and the name of the state of its incorporation. The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
Section 8.2. Seal.
. The shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be represented by a certificate, unless and until the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopts a resolution permitting shares to be uncertificated. Notwithstanding the adoption of any such resolution providing for uncertificated shares, every holder of capital stock of the Corporation theretofore represented by certificates and, upon request, every holder of uncertificated shares, shall be entitled to have a certificate for shares of capital stock of the Corporation signed by, or in the name of the Corporation by, (a) the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or any Executive Vice President, and (b) the Chief Financial Officer, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, certifying the number of shares owned by such stockholder in the Corporation.
Section 9.1. Shares of Stock
. Any or all of the signatures on a certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
Section 9.2. Signatures
. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate or uncertificated shares be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issuance of a new certificate or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owner's legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.
Section 9.3. Lost Certificates
 
. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the manner prescribed by applicable law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation, and in the case of certificated shares of stock, only by the person named in the certificate or by such person's attorney lawfully constituted in writing and upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, properly endorsed for transfer and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; or, in the case of uncertificated shares of stock, upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered holder of the shares or by such person's attorney lawfully constituted in writing, and upon payment of all necessary transfer taxes and compliance with appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form; provided, however, that such surrender and endorsement, compliance or payment of taxes shall not be required in any case in which the officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive such requirement. With respect to certificated shares of stock, every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the Corporation shall be marked "Cancelled," with the date of cancellation, by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or the transfer agent thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.
Section 9.4. Transfers
. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.
Section 9.5. Dividend Record Date
. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise required by law.
Section 9.6. Record Owners
. The Corporation may from time to time maintain one or more transfer offices or agencies and registry offices or agencies at such place or places as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Section 9.7. Transfer and Registry Agents
Subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed at any regular meeting of the stockholders (or at any special meeting duly called for that purpose) by a vote of not less than 70% of the outstanding stock entitled to vote at such meeting; provided that in the notice of such special meeting, notice of such purpose shall be given. Subject to the laws of the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may by majority vote of those present at any meeting at which a quorum is present amend these Bylaws, or enact such other bylaws as in their judgment may be advisable for the regulation of the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation.

PRESS RELEASE

(See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
today reported revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 of $868.0 million compared to fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 revenues of $905.8 million. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $15.0 million, a 29.7% increase from $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 increased 38.1% to $0.29 compared to fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 net income per diluted share of $0.21.
NEW YORK, NY  December 16, 2009  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
 
Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $15.3 million ($0.29 per diluted share) compared to $14.8 million ($0.28 per diluted share) in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted income from continuing operations (which excludes items impacting comparability) increased to $20.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations of $18.9 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
"Despite a challenging business environment, operating profit from our four divisions improved year-over-year for the quarter by $1.9 million, driven by continued cost controls and an aggressive focus on operating margins," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer of ABM Industries Incorporated.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009 was $41.3 million compared to $42.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Slipsager continued: "The Company delivered outstanding results for the quarter and the full year, particularly in light of what was an exceptionally challenging economy through the course of the 2009 fiscal year. Revenues for the fourth quarter were essentially flat compared sequentially to the third quarter, reversing earlier declines and showing signs of a stabilizing economy. Our consistent focus on job profitability and expense management clearly contributed to our successful performance. Adjusted income from continuing operations increased 22% for the fiscal year. These solid financial results, combined with the revenue trends we are seeing, strongly position the Company for a rebound in the U.S. economy and an improved outlook for fiscal year 2010."
Slipsager concluded: "We also finished the fiscal year with record net cash from operations of more than $140 million. Our cash flow enabled the Company to reduce the debt on our line of credit by more than $57 million and pay out nearly $27 million in dividends." (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
The Company reported revenues for the fiscal year that ended October 31, 2009 of $3.5 billion compared to fiscal year 2008 revenues of $3.6 billion. Net income for fiscal year 2009 was $54.3 million, an increase of 19.5% compared to $45.4 million for fiscal year 2008. Net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2009 increased 19.3% to $1.05 compared to $0.88 per diluted share in fiscal year 2008. Income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 increased to $55.5 million ($1.07 per diluted share) compared to $52.7 million ($1.03 per diluted share) for fiscal year 2008. Adjusted income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $68.8 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, compared to $56.4 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2008. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.135 per common share, which is nearly a 4% increase, payable on February 1, 2010 to stockholders of record on January 7, 2010. This will be ABM's 175consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
th
 
Guidance
The Company estimates that full fiscal year 2010 income from continuing operations per diluted share will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.35 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, will be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)

Factors that could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to the following: (1) risks relating to our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations; (2) intense competition can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (3) we are subject to volatility associated with high deductibles for certain insurable risks; (4) an increase in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (5) we provide our services pursuant to agreements which are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 60 days' notice; (6) our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients; (7) our transition to a shared services function could create disruption in functions affected; (8) we incur significant accounting and other control costs that reduce profitability; (9) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (10) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (11) the financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect results; (12) our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash; (13) because ABM conducts business operations through operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations; (14) certain future declines or fluctuations in the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired could negatively impact our earnings; (15) uncertainty in the credit markets and the financial services industry may impact our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and may negatively impact our cash flow; (16) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect our results of operations; (17) an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (18) we are defendants in several class and representative actions or other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (19) since we are an attractive employer for recent migrs to this country and many of our jobs are filled by such, changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly adversely affect our labor force, operations and financial results and our reputation; (20) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; and (21) we participate in multi-employer defined benefit plans which could result in substantial liabilities being incurred. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties the Company faces is contained in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K/A
for the year ended October 31, 2008 and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, the Company has presented income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and fiscal years 2009 and 2008 and guidance for fiscal year 2010, as adjusted for items impacting comparability. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the fourth quarter and fiscal years 2009 and 2008. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

PRESS RELEASE
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations", and "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share". Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
today announced revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 of $869.9 million compared to first quarter of fiscal year 2009 revenues of $887.5 million. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $12.8 million, a 10.1% decrease from $14.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 decreased 14.3% to $0.24 compared to first quarter of fiscal year 2009 net income
NEW YORK, NY  March 1, 2010  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
 
per diluted share of $0.28. Net income for the first quarter of 2010 included a $1.2 million after-tax expense ($0.03 per diluted share) from items impacting comparability compared to a net gain of $1.8 million ($0.04 per diluted share) from items impacting comparability in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, which included a $5.8 million after-tax benefit from a settlement with a former third-party administrator of workers' compensation claims.
"The Company's financial results essentially met our expectations for the first quarter of the fiscal year" said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries Incorporated. "We are encouraged that revenues increased sequentially, our sales pipeline remains strong and client retention is improving compared to the first half of fiscal 2009  all pointing to an improving sales outlook.
"We are successfully executing our operating strategies around cost controls and cash and expense management. We decreased total expenses by nearly 2% in the first quarter, and reduced our SG&A expenses by 12% year-over-year. SG&A reductions were driven by lower information technology costs as we conclude the upgrade of our enterprise systems and continued aggressive cost controls measures by the Janitorial Division. Operating cash flow remains on plan for the year. Our rigorous focus on managing job profitability helped us achieve 8% increases in both adjusted income and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year.
"Operating profit for our divisions increased nearly 6%. Engineering had a very strong first quarter, with revenues growing nearly 16%, operating profit increasing 7% and a robust sales pipeline building, particularly for ABM Energy Services. Parking increased operating profit by 21% and Janitorial by nearly 6%. We also continue to meet our clients' demand for an environmentally sustainable approach to facility services as we surpassed more than 200 million square feet of space operating under ABM Janitorial's industry-leading green cleaning program, including more than 50 million square feet of space that is LEED-certified by the U.S. Green Building Council."
Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $12.8 million ($0.24 per diluted share) compared to $14.8 million ($0.29 per diluted share) in the year-ago quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, income from continuing operations increased to $14.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. This compares to income from continuing operations (excluding items impacting comparability) of $13.0 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $32.7 million compared to $30.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009.
Slipsager continued: "During last year's recession, we took a series of actions to navigate a difficult economy and position the Company for future growth. We see the signs of progress as revenue trends are moving in the right direction, even with extended sales cycles. While we anticipated increases in state unemployment insurance rates, the states raised these even beyond our projections, which impacted first quarter results by $0.01 to $0.02 cents per diluted share and will have greater impact in the second quarter. We are taking the appropriate action across the Company to mitigate the effect of these taxes going forward. Our existing sales pipeline, coupled with an improving economy, should lead to top line growth year-over-year in the second half of fiscal 2010, and we will continue our aggressive measures to generate bottom line savings by successfully executing our operating strategies."
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.135 per common share payable on May 3, 2010 to stockholders of record on April 8, 2010. This will be ABM's 176consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
th
Guidance
The Company reiterates its estimates that full fiscal year 2010 income from continuing operations per diluted share will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.35 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, will be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. For comparison purposes, the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 has one additional work day compared to the year-ago quarter.

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On March 31, 2010, the Compensation Committee of the Company approved equity grants consisting of stock options and restricted stock units to James Lusk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, James McClure, Executive Vice President and President of ABM Janitorial Services, Steven M. Zaccagnini, Executive Vice President and President of ABM Facility Services, and Sarah H. McConnell, Senior Vice President and General Counsel. These grants are effective on March 31, 2010. Henrik C. Slipsager, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, had requested that the Compensation Committee consider making equity grants to these executive officers, consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy which seeks to motivate and retain key executives as well as to recognize contributions made by these executives to the Company. Mr. Slipsager specifically requested that he not be considered for an award. The Compensation Committee reviewed various considerations related to the proposed awards and determined that such awards were appropriate and would further the Company's goals and objectives as it relates to retention and recognition. As described below, the equity grants consist of stock option awards and awards of restricted stock units which do not vest until the fifth anniversary of the date of grant and which do not contain accelerated vesting in the event of an executive's retirement prior to the vesting date.
In connection with these grants, on March 31, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company amended and restated the Statement of Terms and Conditions Applicable to Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Shares Granted to Employees Pursuant to the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the flexibility of the administrator under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan to establish vesting criteria with respect to equity awards.
The above summary is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated Statement of Terms and Conditions Applicable to Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Shares Granted to Employees Pursuant to the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1.
The number of restricted stock units awarded to each officer is based on the fair market value of ABM common stock at the close of business on March 31, 2010 and is determined by dividing the dollar amount set forth opposite each officer's name on the list below by the fair market value of ABM common stock on March 31, 2010. The fair market value means the closing price at which ABM common stock traded on March 31, 2010 (FMV) which was $21.20.
The number of shares subject to the nonqualified stock options awarded to each officer is established by reference to the dollar amount set forth opposite such officer's name on the list below and based on the Black-Scholes value for such options on March 31, 2010. The exercise price for such options is the FMV of ABM common stock at the close of business on March 31, 2010, which was $21.20.
 
Restricted stock units granted to each such officer will vest on March 31, 2015 and stock options granted to each officer will vest on March 31, 2015. Unvested restricted stock units and unvested stock options may vest prior to March 31, 2015, on a pro rata basis, in the event of the officer's death or disability. In addition, unvested restricted stock units and unvested stock options may vest prior to March 31, 2015, in the event of a change of control.
The above summary relating to the grant of restricted stock units and stock options is qualified in its entirety by the terms and conditions set forth in the form of restricted stock unit award agreement and form of stock option award agreement, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3, respectively; and by the Amended and Restated Statement of Terms and Conditions Applicable to Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Shares Granted to Employees Pursuant to the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1; and to the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan.

Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations", and "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share". Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
 
today announced revenues for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 of $855.5 million compared to second quarter of fiscal year 2009 revenues of $855.7 million. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $8.6 million, a 32.9% decrease from $12.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009. Net income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 decreased 36.0% to $0.16 compared to second quarter of fiscal year 2009 net income per diluted share of $0.25. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was impacted by a $2.7 million after-tax expense ($0.05 per diluted share) for a specific legal contingency; a $2.2 million after-tax expense ($0.04 per diluted share) resulting from one additional day of labor expense in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 compared to the year-ago quarter; and higher than anticipated state unemployment insurance expense of approximately $0.03 per diluted share.
NEW YORK, NY  June 2, 2010  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
"The Company's adjusted earnings for the quarter are as anticipated and we continue to expect year-over-year growth in the second half of the fiscal year," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries Incorporated. "Revenues were flat for the quarter and the first six months of the fiscal year, pointing to signs of gradual improvement in the economic climate compared to fiscal year 2009. Traditional seasonal reductions in labor expense in the second half of the fiscal year combined with one less working day in the third quarter will contribute to improved profitability. We also will mitigate the impact of higher unemployment insurance expense during the second half of the year through a combination of government hiring incentives, working with our clients and improved operating efficiencies. Further, we expect that recent sales wins, our expanding sales pipeline and an increasing focus on client retention will drive top-line growth going forward."
"We also are continuing to have success with our strategies for effectively managing costs and capital. We reduced our line of credit by $27 million, to $145 million, in the quarter. Our days sales outstanding of 48 decreased by 3 days since January 31, 2010. Executing our cost and capital strategies helped the Company achieve net operating cash flow from continuing operations of $50 million, a more than 60% increase over the year-ago quarter. We will continue our successful operating strategies to deliver bottom line savings and generate cash."
"Our divisions continue to secure new business as the economy improves while maintaining a sharp focus on job profitability. Engineering had another strong quarter, with both revenues and operating profit growing by more than 20% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. While Parking revenues were essentially flat year-over-year, the Division increased operating profit by more than 6% in the second quarter, driven by strong performance with several airport clients and an ongoing focus on management of indirect expenses. The Janitorial Division continues to aggressively manage labor and other costs to offset pressures on revenues. The Division's results were primarily impacted by the one additional day of labor expense in the second quarter and higher state unemployment insurance costs. Security revenues were slightly down for the quarter, and profitability was also impacted by the higher than anticipated state unemployment insurance tax rates."
Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $8.6 million ($0.16 per diluted share) compared to $13.0 million ($0.25 per diluted share) in the year-ago quarter. As noted above, income was impacted by a $2.7 million after-tax expense ($0.05 per diluted share) for a specific legal contingency; a $2.2 million after-tax expense ($0.04 per diluted share) resulting from one additional day of labor expense in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 compared to the year-ago quarter; and higher than anticipated state unemployment insurance expense of approximately $0.03 per diluted share. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted income from continuing operations was $11.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations of $16.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $29.4 million compared to $36.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.
 
The Company reported revenues for the six months ended April 30, 2010 of $1.7 billion, flat compared to year-ago revenues of $1.7 billion. Net income for the first six months of fiscal year 2010 was $21.4 million, a decrease of 20.9% compared to $27.0 million for the first half of fiscal year 2009. Net income per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal year 2010 decreased 21.2% to $0.41 per diluted share compared to $0.52 per diluted share in the first half of fiscal year 2009. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2010 was $21.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $27.8 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2009. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal year 2010 was $26.0 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $29.4 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2009. Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of fiscal year 2010 was $62.0 million compared to $66.4 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2009.
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a third quarter cash dividend of $0.135 per common share payable on August 2, 2010 to stockholders of record on July 1, 2010. This will be ABM's 177consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
th
Guidance
The Company reiterates its estimates that full fiscal year 2010 income from continuing operations per diluted share will be in the range of $1.25 to $1.35 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, will be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45.

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. In addition, the financial results reported in this release continue to be subject to adjustment until filing of the Company's quarterly report on
Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended April 30, 2010. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to the following: (1) risks relating to our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations; (2) intense competition can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (3) we are subject to volatility associated with high deductibles for certain insurable risks; (4) an increase in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (5) we provide our services pursuant to agreements which are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 60 days' notice; (6) our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients; (7) our transition to a shared services function could create disruption in functions affected; (8) we incur significant accounting and other control costs that reduce profitability; (9) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (10) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (11) the financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect results; (12) our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash; (13) because ABM conducts business operations through operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations; (14) certain future declines or fluctuations in the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired could negatively impact our earnings; (15) uncertainty in the credit markets and the financial services industry may impact our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and may negatively impact our cash flow; (16) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect our results of operations; (17) an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (18) we are defendants in several class and representative actions or other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (19) since we are an attractive employer for recent migrs to this country and many of our jobs are filled by such, changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly and adversely affect our labor force, operations and financial results and our reputation; (20) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; (21) federal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations; (22) we participate in multi-employer defined benefit plans which could result in substantial liabilities being incurred; and (23) natural disasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt our services. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties the Company faces is contained in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K
for the year ended October 31, 2009 and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, the Company has presented income from continuing operations for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and guidance for fiscal year 2010, as adjusted for items impacting comparability. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods.

PRESS RELEASE

Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
today announced revenues for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 of $869.0 million compared to third quarter of fiscal year 2009 revenues of $870.6 million. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $21.0 million, a 70.8% increase from $12.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.

NEW YORK, NY  August 31, 2010  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
 
"Overall, the Company delivered good financial results for the quarter," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries. "Revenues were flat as the Janitorial business in particular was still affected by the slower pace of economic recovery, which continues to pressure client spending. We are focused on client retention to sustain and build revenues; streamlining the Janitorial organization to strengthen sales performance, service delivery and cost controls; and we are expanding our sales pipeline. We also continue to aggressively manage cash, costs and margins to mitigate slow economic growth and maintain profitability. These combined efforts continue to yield positive results as income was up in the quarter, and adjusted EBITDA, a key measure of our performance, grew 22% year-over-year."
"Operating cash flow from continuing operations increased to $35.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 compared to $8.3 million in the year-ago quarter. At the same time, our SG&A expenses decreased 15.5% in the third quarter as a result of cost control measures and lower compensation costs. SG&A expenses are down 8.8% for the first nine months of the fiscal year. As planned, we completed the core project work associated with our investment in the Company's infrastructure and reported no additional one-time expenses associated with these corporate initiatives in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010, compared to $3.1 million in after-tax expenses in the year-ago quarter."
"Operationally, the Engineering Division had a terrific quarter as revenues grew more than 14%, driven by sales to both new and existing clients, and operating profit increased 21% year-over-year. Parking revenues were down slightly, primarily as a result of lower management reimbursement revenues. Parking increased operating profit for the quarter by more than 17%. Security revenues increased slightly, driven by new client sales, while operating profit decreased due to cost pressures on existing clients and certain one-time items. Janitorial operating profit increased more than 10%, benefiting from one less workday compared to the prior year. During the quarter, the Janitorial Division also acquired Diversco, Inc., a provider of outsourced facility services, particularly to manufacturing and industrial clients. The acquisition of Diversco strategically expands ABM's janitorial and security footprint  within key regions and among key client segments  and the integration is proceeding on course. Acquisitions remain a key focus of our strategy."
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $21.0 million ($0.40 per diluted share) compared to $12.4 million ($0.24 per diluted share) in the year-ago quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted income from continuing operations was $22.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations of $18.6 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $45.9 million compared to $37.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.
The Company reported revenues for the nine months ended July 31, 2010 of $2.6 billion, flat compared to year-ago revenues of $2.6 billion. Net income for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010 was $42.3 million, an increase of 7.8% compared to $39.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2009. Net income per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010 was $0.80 per diluted share compared to $0.76 per diluted share for the first nine months of fiscal year 2009. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010 was $42.4 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared to $40.2 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2009. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010 was $47.9 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $48.0 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2009. Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010 was $108.0 million compared to $104.2 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2009.
 
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.135 per common share payable on November 1, 2010 to stockholders of record on October 7, 2010. This will be ABM's 178consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
th
Guidance
As a result of the slower pace of economic recovery, the Company estimates that full fiscal year 2010 income from continuing operations per diluted share will be in the range of $1.15 to $1.19 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, will be in the range of $1.33 to $1.37.

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. In addition, the financial results reported in this release continue to be subject to adjustment until filing of the Company's quarterly report on
Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended July 31, 2010. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to the following: (1) risks relating to our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations; (2) intense competition can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (3) we are subject to volatility associated with high deductibles for certain insurable risks; (4) an increase in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (5) we provide our services pursuant to agreements which are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 60 days' notice; (6) our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients; (7) our transition to a shared services function could create disruption in functions affected; (8) we incur significant accounting and other control costs that reduce profitability; (9) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (10) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (11) the financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect results; (12) our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash; (13) because ABM conducts business operations through operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations; (14) certain future declines or fluctuations in the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired could negatively impact our earnings; (15) uncertainty in the credit markets and the financial services industry may impact our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and may negatively impact our cash flow; (16) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect our results of operations; (17) an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (18) we are defendants in several class and representative actions or other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (19) since we are an attractive employer for recent migrs to this country and many of our jobs are filled by such, changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly and adversely affect our labor force, operations and financial results and our reputation; (20) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; (21) federal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations; (22) we participate in multi-employer defined benefit plans which could result in substantial liabilities being incurred; and (23) natural disasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt our services. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties the Company faces is contained in the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K
for the year ended October 31, 2009 and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, the Company has presented income from continuing operations, as adjusted for items impacting comparability, for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2010 and 2009. The Company also presents guidance for fiscal year 2010, as adjusted. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)

Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On October 25, 2010, ABM Industries Incorporated (the "Company") entered into an executive employment agreement substantially in the form of the Executive Employment Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this current report (the "Executive Employment Agreement") with Sarah H. McConnell (Senior Vice President and General Counsel). On October 26, 2010, the Company entered in an Executive Employment Agreement with each of James S. Lusk (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer) and Steven M. Zaccagnini (Executive Vice President), and on October 27, 2010, the Company entered into an Executive Employment Agreement with James P. McClure (Executive Vice President). The Executive Employment Agreement will replace each executive's current employment agreement. The current employment agreements for each such officer are scheduled to expire on October 31, 2010. The current employment agreement between the Company and Henrik Slipsager, President and Chief Executive Officer, does not expire until October 31, 2013.
The initial term of the Executive Employment Agreement will expire on October 31, 2012, and the term will automatically renew for consecutive one-year terms unless the Company provides notice not to renew. Each executive will continue to receive their current base salary, equal to $471,435 for Messrs. Lusk and Zaccagnini, $581,500 for Mr. McClure and $389,000 for Ms. McConnell. In addition, under the terms of the Executive Employment Agreement, each executive is eligible to receive an annual cash bonus pursuant to the Company's Performance Incentive Program, to participate in the Company's 2006 Equity Incentive Program and to receive such perquisites as are generally provided to similarly situated executives of the Company.
The Executive Employment Agreement provides that the Company may terminate an executive's employment without "Cause" (as defined in the Executive Employment Agreement). Upon such a termination, an executive's right to severance benefits will be governed by the terms of the Company's Severance Policy or any similar plan or policy of the Company as in effect from time to time that provides severance benefits upon a termination of employment. The Executive Employment Agreement provides that if any amount or benefit to be paid to an executive, whether pursuant to the Company's Severance Policy or otherwise, would create an obligation for an executive to pay an excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (an "Excess Parachute Payment"), such payment will be reduced so that no portion of the payment constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment, unless such reduction would result in an executive receiving an amount that is less than 90% of the amount of the severance payment, after taking into account all applicable taxes on such payment, including any excise taxes.
The terms of the Executive Employment Agreement provide that upon the termination of an executive's employment for any reason, the executive will refrain from competing with, or soliciting the employees or customers of the Company for one year following the termination of employment, as set forth in the Executive Employment Agreement.
A copy of the form of the Executive Employment Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 to this current report and is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Credit Agreement
On November 30, 2010, ABM Industries Incorporated ("ABM") entered into a Credit Agreement (the "New Credit Agreement") with Bank of America, N.A. ("Bank of America"), as administrative agent, swing line lender and letter of credit issuer and the lenders party thereto. The New Credit Agreement has a five-year term and provides for revolving loans, swingline loans and letters of credit up to an aggregate of $650 million (the "New Credit Facility"). Subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity, ABM will be able to elect to increase the size of the New Credit Facility up to a maximum of $850 million. The New Credit Agreement has a maturity date of November 30, 2015.
The obligations of ABM and any designated borrowers under the New Credit Agreement are guaranteed jointly and severally by ABM and certain current and future subsidiaries of ABM.
Interest on the borrowings under the New Credit Agreement is payable, at the option of ABM, at either a "Base rate" or a "Eurodollar rate," and with respect to swingline loans, an "IBOR rate," in each case plus an applicable margin and, with respect to Eurodollar rate borrowings, a mandatory cost. Borrowings under the New Credit Agreement may be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures.
The New Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of its type, including, but not limited to, limitations on the incurrence of liens, asset dispositions, investments, indebtedness, dividends, restricted payments and transactions with affiliates. The New Credit Agreement requires ABM to meet certain financial tests, including (1) a minimum consolidated net worth test, (2) a fixed charge coverage ratio test, and (3) a leverage ratio test.
The New Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to certain indebtedness, certain events of bankruptcy, certain events under ERISA, inability to pay debts, issuance of writs or warrants of attachment against assets, material judgments, invalidity of loan documents and changes of control. If an event of default occurs under the New Credit Agreement, the agents and lenders under the New Credit Agreement will be entitled to take various actions, including accelerating amounts due under the New Credit Facility.
Concurrent with the execution of the New Credit Agreement, ABM and Bank of America terminated the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2007, by and among ABM, various financial institutions and Bank of America, as administrative agent (the "Prior Credit Agreement").
The foregoing summary of the New Credit Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the New Credit Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
Acquisition of The Linc Group
On December 1, 2010, ABM acquired The Linc Group, LLC ("TLG") pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 1, 2010 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among ABM, TLG, GI Manager L.P., as the Members Representative, and Lightning Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of ABM ("Merger Sub").
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into TLG, and TLG continued as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of ABM. The aggregate purchase price for all of the outstanding limited liability company interests of TLG was $300 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contained certain customary representations and warranties, and the parties have agreed to certain covenants.
 
The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties by ABM and TLG made solely for the benefit of the other. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties are qualified by information in confidential disclosure schedules that the parties have exchanged in connection with signing the Merger Agreement. Moreover, certain representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were made as of a specified date, may be subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from what might be viewed as material to stockholders or may have been used for the purpose of allocating risk between the parties rather than establishing matters as facts. Accordingly, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement should not be relied on by any persons as characterizations of the actual state of facts about the parties at the time they were made or otherwise.
Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.
In connection with entering into the New Credit Agreement, on November 30, 2010, ABM terminated the Prior Credit Agreement. The Prior Credit Agreement was terminated because it has been replaced with the New Credit Facility, as discussed in Item 1.01 under the heading "Credit Agreement" above.

Each Loan Party agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to ) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or repayments.

If the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from or to another currency (which conversion, if any, shall be effected by the Administrative Agent in accordance with its normal banking procedures) incurred by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), that each Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
Treatment of Certain Refunds
provided
3.2 . If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) or, in the case of the Swing Line Lender, IBOR Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate or, in the case of the Swing Line Lender, the IBOR Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Company through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans or IBOR Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans, shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all such Eurodollar Rate Loans or IBOR Rate Loans, as applicable, of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans or IBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans or IBOR Rate Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrowers shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
Illegality
 
3.3 . If the Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or (c) the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. If the Swing Line Lender determines that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the IBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed IBOR Rate Loan, or that the IBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed IBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Swing Line Lender of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or the Swing Line Lender to make or maintain IBOR Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders or the Swing Line Lender, as applicable) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies or IBOR Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Revolving Borrowing or a Swing Line Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(iv) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans or IBOR Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan or IBOR Rate Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right to demand such compensation, that no Borrower shall be required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
Delay in Requests
provided
(e) . The Company shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurodollar funds or deposits (currently known as ""), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender and, in the case of the Swing Line Lender, the actual costs of such reserves allocated to the applicable IBOR Rate Loan by such Lender (in each case as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurodollar Rate Loans or, in the case of the Swing Line Lender, IBOR Rate Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Loan, the Company shall have received at least 10 days' prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs from such Lender.

Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE: ABM) announced today that it has acquired The Linc Group, LLC (TLG) for $300 million in cash. The transaction closed earlier today.
NEW YORK, December 1, 2010 
ABM, which operates through its subsidiaries, is a leading United States provider of facility services. Irvine, California-based TLG is a premier provider of end-to-end integrated facilities services that improve operating efficiencies, reduce energy consumption and lower overall operational costs of critical facilities, installations and buildings in the government, commercial and residential markets. TLGs 2009 revenues totaled $579.2 million.
This is a game changer for ABMs business, said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries Incorporated. Acquiring a firm of TLGs quality transforms our engineering and energy business overnight and completely differentiates us from our competitors. This strengthens ABMs position in a higher growth segment and cements our leadership role in the facilities services industry. By combining ABMs existing Engineering Division with TLG, we are bringing two entities together with proven track records of double-digit growth both in sales and earnings. The combined engineering operations will be close to $1 billion in revenues.
Slipsager continued: With this move, we are in an outstanding position to deliver leading client solutions to meet the global drive towards green buildings and energy efficiency. We aim to be the provider of choice for those clients. This transaction also brings us into the $70 billion government marketplace, where TLG brings broad experience and deep client relationships. This is a winning combination where we gain new customers and geographic scope, and the combined team has the talent to drive our growth.
TLG Chairman, President and CEO Tracy Price will become president of the combined ABM engineering group and will report directly to Slipsager. Mr. Price will continue to work from Irvine, California.
 
The integrated facilities services sector offers substantial growth opportunities driven by increasing demand for efficiency and the growing awareness that power generating resources are finite, said Price. These opportunities include: the growing use of third-party facilities services vendors; the increasing focus on green buildings and energy efficiency; the convergence of energy and communications technology; international expansion; and the drive for cost-effective facilities management service for large-scale facilities. Leveraging our experience with mission-critical facilities, customized solutions and advanced technologies, we are well-positioned to capitalize on these market trends. Joining with ABM provides excellent new opportunities for our clients and employees and our team is excited about the opportunity to take what we have built to a new level under the auspices of Henrik and ABM.
Slipsager added, Our companies are highly complementary. The combined company will add TLGs offerings to ABMs existing vertical and geographic markets. By leveraging the existing businesses of both TLG and ABM, we will be able to offer clients truly integrated facility services and turn-key, in-house solutions. Were particularly excited about the advantages that TLG brings to the table: existing relationships and extensive work in the government sector, expanding international operations, and technology-oriented capabilities, including highly complicated energy efficiency work and retrofitting.
Geographically, TLGs operational footprint spans more than one billion square feet over more than 25,000 facilities, including some international presence across six continents. In the U.S., it operates in 46 states.
Combining the two businesses will generate synergies for ABM. The expected synergies will only have partial impact in fiscal year 2011, and full impact in 2012. Therefore, ABM expects the deal to be slightly accretive to fiscal year 2011 earnings and further accretive in 2012.
On Thursday, December 16, 2010, ABM will conduct a meeting for investors and analysts in New York where the expected impact of the acquisition will be discussed in detail. The session will be webcast and further details will follow in a subsequent announcement.
With this transaction, ABM is expected to join the 2011 ranks of the Fortune 500.
Jones, Day acted as legal counsel to ABM for the transaction and Credit Suisse served as ABMs financial advisor. Jefferies & Company, Inc. served as financial advisor to TLG and Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP served as legal counsel.

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to the following: (1) risks relating to our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations; (2) intense competition can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (3) an increase in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (4) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (5) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (6) the financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect results; (7) because ABM conducts business operations through operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations; (8) uncertainty in the credit markets and the financial services industry may impact our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and may negatively impact our cash flow; (9) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect our results of operations; (10) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; (11) our ability to draw down under the new credit agreement is subject to our being in compliance with various financial and other business-related covenants at the time we wish to borrow additional funds; (12) the new credit agreement contains terms which restrict our ability to engage in certain activities, including making additional investments, which could limit our ability to use the credit facility to fund our strategic objectives; and (13) increases in our level of debt or in our interest rates under the new credit facility could reduce our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business activity.

Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by any consent in writing by such holders. Attendance of a stockholder (or stockholder's proxy) at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when a stockholder (or stockholder's proxy) objects, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened; , that attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required by law or these Bylaws to be included in the notice but not so included if such objection is expressly made at the meeting.

If the office of any director becomes vacant for any reason or any new directorship is created by any increase in the authorized number of directors, a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, may choose a successor or successors to fill the vacancy or newly created directorship.

The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was or has agreed to become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against costs, charges, expenses (including attorneys' fees) judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the

The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was or has agreed to become a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against costs, charges, expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom, if such person acted in good faith and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action, suit or proceeding was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such costs, charges and expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper; , , that the foregoing indemnity shall not be applicable as to any person who is or was or agreed to become an employee or agent of the Corporation (other than employees or agents who also are or were or agreed to be officers or directors of the Corporation), or is or was serving or agreed to serve at the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, (other than employees or agents who also are or were or agreed to be officers or directors of any such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan), unless and until such indemnity is specifically approved by the Board of Directors.
Section 7.2. Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation.
provided
however
 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article (including, without limitation, Section 7.4), to the extent that a present or former director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article), of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise, including, without limitation, the dismissal of an action without prejudice, in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against all costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or on his behalf in connection therewith.
Section 7.3. Indemnification for Costs, Charges and Expenses of Successful Party.
Any indemnification under Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court) shall be paid by the Corporation unless a determination is made (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of the quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders, that indemnification of the director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article) is not proper in the circumstances because he has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 of this Article.
Section 7.4. Determination of Right to Indemnification.
To the extent permitted by law, costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by a person referred to in Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate; , , that the payment of such costs, charges and expenses incurred by a director or officer in his capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person while a director or officer) in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article.
Section 7.5. Advance of Costs, Charges and Expenses.
provided
however
Any indemnification under Sections 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 of this Article or payment with respect to a claim under Section 7.5 of this Article shall be made promptly, and in any event within 30 days, upon the written request of the director, officer, employee or agent. The right to indemnification or advancement of costs, charges and expenses as granted by this Article shall be enforceable by the director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 of this Article or seeking advancement pursuant to Section 7.5 of this Article) in any court of competent jurisdiction, if the Corporation denies such request, in whole or in part, or if no disposition is made within 30 days. Any determination under Section 7.4 of this Article that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of care shall not bar the right of the claimant to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the right to indemnification granted by this Article. The Corporation shall indemnify such persons against costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his right to indemnification or advancement of costs, charges and expenses, in whole or in part, in any such action. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of costs, charges and expenses under Section 7.5 of this Article) that the claimant has not, as provided in Section 7.4, met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article, nor the fact that there has been an actual determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, its independent legal counsel, and its stockholders) under Section 7.4 of this Article that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Section 7.6. Procedure for Indemnification.
 
The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by this Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding office or while employed by or acting as agent for the Corporation, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article), and shall inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of such person. All rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this Article shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article) of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while this Article is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Article or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law or any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses to such director or officer (or employee or agent being indemnified pursuant to Section 7.1 or 7.2 of this Article), or the obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder.
Section 7.7. Other Rights; Continuation of Right to Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
The Corporation shall purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him or on his behalf in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article, provided that such insurance is available on acceptable terms, which determination shall be made by a vote of a majority of the Entire Board.
Section 7.8. Insurance.
If this Article or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director, officer, employee and agent of the Corporation as to costs, charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to the full extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article that shall not have been invalidated and to the full extent permitted by applicable law.

NEW YORK, NY  December 15, 2010  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
"The Company's fourth quarter results delivered a strong finish to the fiscal year," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries Incorporated. "Revenues increased nearly 4% as the Company produced year-over-year growth for the first time in several quarters, including revenues generated from our acquisitions during the fiscal year. We are seeing signs of improvement in our organic growth. Improving revenues, combined with effective management of costs, produced double-digit earnings gains in the fourth quarter as net income increased 45% year-over-year."
"As a result of our ongoing focus on controlling costs to improve margins and sustain profitability, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% compared to the year-ago quarter. SG&A for the quarter decreased more than 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower IT costs, and we continue to reduce these expenses as a percentage of revenues. Further, our days sales outstanding declined to 47 days. The combination of our aggressive focus on increased profitability, lower long-term receivables and other assets and tax benefits from the OneSource acquisition helped generate a record $141 million in net cash flow from continuing operations in 2010."
"All four Divisions produced year-over-year revenue increases, a positive direction in what remains a slow economy. Parking grew revenues by more than 13% in the quarter and Security revenues increased 6%. Janitorial revenues are trending better, increasing 1.3% from the year-ago quarter and 2.4% sequentially. These three Divisions generated additional sales in the quarter from key acquisitions earlier in the fiscal year. Engineering continued its upward growth with a 7.5% rise in revenues in the fourth quarter. All of our Divisions continue to do an exceptional job of mitigating the impact of the economy through rigorous cost reductions and a sharp focus on profitability. These efforts are yielding positive results as operating profit for the Divisions increased by almost 6% from the year-ago quarter."
Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 was $21.4 million ($0.41 per diluted share) compared to $15.3 million ($0.29 per diluted share) in the year-ago quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted income from continuing operations was $22.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations of $20.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.
The Company reported revenues for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2010 of $3.5 billion, flat compared to year-ago revenues. Net income for fiscal year 2010 was $64.1 million, an increase of 18.1% compared to $54.3 million for fiscal year 2009. Net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2010 was $1.21 per diluted share compared to $1.05 per diluted share for fiscal year 2009. Income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2010 was $63.9 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, compared to $55.5 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2009. Adjusted income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2010 was $70.5 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, compared to $68.8 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2009. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2010 was $155.9 million compared to $145.5 million for fiscal year 2009.
 
On December 1, the Company announced that it had acquired The Linc Group, LLC for $300 million in cash. Linc is a premier provider of end-to-end integrated facilities services that improve operating efficiencies, reduce energy consumption and lower overall operational costs of critical facilities, installations and buildings in the government, commercial and residential sectors. During the fourth quarter, on October 1, the Company also expanded its Parking Division with the acquisition of select assets from the L&R Group of Companies.
Slipsager concluded: "The Linc acquisition is transformational. This transaction greatly expands our client base in engineering and energy services to seize upon the significant growth opportunities in these key markets. During the fourth quarter, we also expanded our national parking operations with the assets from L&R and, earlier in the fiscal year, added new clients and services through the acquisition of Diversco. Both the L&R and Diversco assets are being successfully integrated and are already contributing to additional sales and profitability. Improving revenue trends, as we saw in the fourth quarter, combined with the sales contribution of these key acquisitions, should bring a return to consistent revenue growth. Our strategic actions, operational results and strong cash flow during the fiscal year give us clear momentum and a solid foundation for growth in 2011."
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.14 per common share, which is nearly a 4% increase, payable on February 7, 2011 to stockholders of record on January 6, 2011. This will be ABM's 179consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
th
Guidance
As a result of transaction and integration costs as well as other unique items, the Company estimates that income from continuing operations per diluted share for the full 2011 fiscal year will be in the range of $1.23 to $1.33 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, of $1.43 to $1.53. Factors expected to influence full fiscal year 2011 results include: The Linc Group acquisition will be slightly accretive, with no accretion in the first quarter. The Company expects transaction and integration expense for the full fiscal year of $8 million to $10 million pre-tax. There also will be one additional work day of labor expense for 2011 compared to the prior year, with a pre-tax impact of $4 million to $5 million, primarily on Janitorial fixed-price contracts. This includes one additional work day in the first quarter of 2011. The refinancing of the Company's credit facility is expected to increase year-over-year interest expense in the range of $10 million to $12 million pre-tax.

This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to the following: (1) risks relating to our acquisition of The Linc Group LLC ("Linc") and our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations; (2) intense competition can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (3) we are subject to volatility associated with high deductibles for certain insurable risks; (4) an increase in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (5) we provide our services pursuant to agreements which are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice; (6) our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients; (7) we incur significant accounting and other control costs that reduce profitability; (8) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (9) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (10) the financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect results; (11) we are subject to risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations and foreign exchange exposure; (12) our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash; (13) because ABM conducts business operations through operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations; (14) that portion of our revenues which are generated from international operations are subject to political risks and changes in socio-economic conditions, laws and regulations, including labor, monetary and fiscal policies, which could negatively impact our ability to operate and grow our business in the international arena; (15) certain future declines or fluctuations in the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired could negatively impact our earnings; (16) uncertainty in the credit markets and the financial services industry may impact our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and may
 
negatively
impact our cash flow; (17) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect our results of operations; (18) an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (19) we are defendants in several class and representative actions or other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (20) since we are an attractive employer for recent migrs to this country and many of our jobs are filled by such, changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly and adversely affect our labor force, operations and financial results and our reputation; (21) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; (22) federal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations; (23) we participate in multi-employer defined benefit plans which could result in substantial liabilities being incurred; and (24) natural disasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt our services.

The Company also presents guidance for fiscal year 2011, as adjusted. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the fourth quarter and fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods.

PRESS RELEASE
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations", and "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share". Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
 
today announced revenues for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 of $1.03 billion compared to first quarter of fiscal year 2010 revenues of $869.9 million. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $8.4 million, a 34.3% decrease from $12.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 decreased 33.7% to $0.16 compared to net income per diluted share of $0.24 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 was impacted by $2.5 million after-tax of transaction costs associated with The Linc Group acquisition in 2010, $2.3 million after-tax of labor expense from one additional work day and $0.5 million after-tax in higher state unemployment insurance tax compared to the year-ago quarter.
NEW YORK, NY  March 7, 2011  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
"The Company's financial results met our expectations for the first quarter and were consistent with our guidance targets for the fiscal year," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries Incorporated. "Revenues increased 18% year-over-year, reaching a quarterly record of $1.03 billion, and improved sequentially by 14%. The businesses we acquired during 2010  Diversco, L&R Parking companies and The Linc Group  drove sales growth in the quarter. Sales generated by the newly-acquired businesses and a return to organic growth will continue to produce year-over-year revenue gains for the 2011 fiscal year. Despite the top line growth, net income in the first quarter also was impacted by increased year-over-year amortization and interest costs related to the Linc acquisition. However, our focus on improving margins and profitability produced 9% growth in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, including the impact of one additional working day."
"All four Divisions produced revenue increases as the acquired companies generated more than $156 million in sales during the first quarter, ahead of plan, and we saw small overall improvement in organic growth as well. ABM Janitorial slightly increased organic revenues year-over-year for the first time in eight quarters. Janitorial's profitability was impacted by one additional working day, higher state unemployment insurance expense and unanticipated costs associated with snow removal which impacted certain clients. Engineering revenues nearly doubled compared to the year-ago quarter on the strength of sales generated by The Linc Group, which contributed more than $93 million in revenues. Engineering's operating profit increased year-over-year, driven by the Linc business, which was slightly accretive to earnings in the first quarter excluding transaction costs, ahead of our expectations. Parking increased revenues more than 35%, bolstered by new sales and contributions from the L&R companies, while profitability was essentially flat, partly resulting from snow and other weather-related costs. Security revenues were up modestly, including more than $3 million in sales from Diversco, while operating profit remained even with the year-ago quarter."
Slipsager concluded: "We are encouraged by the pace of integration and sales contributions of the companies we acquired last year. The additional revenues will generate year-over-year sales growth and help drive profitability. We will leverage our recent investments in an expanded footprint, increased sales and additional talent to deliver on our financial plans and projections for the year."
Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $8.4 million ($0.16 per diluted share) compared to $12.8 million ($0.24 per diluted share) in the year-ago quarter. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted income from continuing operations was $11.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations of $14.0 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, with the year-over difference primarily a result of the additional work day in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $35.7 million compared to $32.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2010.
 
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.14 per common share payable on May 2, 2011 to stockholders of record on April 7, 2011. This will be ABM's 180consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
th
The Company reaffirmed its guidance and continues to estimate that income from continuing operations per diluted share for the full 2011 fiscal year will be in the range of $1.23 to $1.33 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, of $1.43 to $1.53.

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include but are not limited to the following: (1) risks relating to our acquisition of The Linc Group LLC ("Linc"), including risks relating to reductions in government spending on outsourced services as well as payment delays may adversely affect a significant portion of revenues generated by government contracts, and political and compliance risks in non-U.S. areas in which it operates may adversely affect our operations; (2) our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations; (3) intense competition can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (4) we are subject to volatility associated with high deductibles
 
for certain insurable risks; (5) an increase in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (6) we provide our services pursuant to agreements which are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice; (7) our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients; (8) we incur significant accounting and other control costs that reduce profitability; (9) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (10) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (11) the financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect results; (12) we are subject to risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations and foreign exchange exposure; (13) our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash; (14) because ABM conducts business operations through operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations; (15) that portion of our revenues which are generated from international operations are subject to political risks and changes in socio-economic conditions, laws and regulations, including labor, monetary and fiscal policies, which could negatively impact our ability to operate and grow our business in the international arena; (16) certain future declines or fluctuations in the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired could negatively impact our earnings; (17) uncertainty in the credit markets and the financial services industry may impact our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and may negatively impact our cash flow; (18) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect our results of operations; (19) an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (20) we are defendants in several class and representative actions or other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (21) since we are an attractive employer for recent migrs to this country and many of our jobs are filled by such, changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly and adversely affect our labor force, operations, financial results and reputation; (22) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; (23) federal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations; (24) we participate in multi-employer defined benefit plans which could result in substantial liabilities being incurred; and (25) natural disasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt our services. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties the Company faces is contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2010 and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

PRESS RELEASE
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations", and "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share" (or "Adjusted EPS"). Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
 
today announced revenues for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 of $1.06 billion, a 23.9% increase compared to second quarter of fiscal year 2010 revenues of $855.5 million. Income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $14.2 million, a 64.7% increase from $8.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Income from continuing operations per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 increased 63.9% to $0.26 compared to income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.16 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. Income from continuing operations increased primarily as a result of a $4.7 million after-tax increase in Divisional operating profit in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011, driven by the companies acquired in 2010, and including a $2.3 million after-tax benefit from lower labor expense as a result of one less work day, partially offset by higher state unemployment insurance tax expense and fuel costs. In addition, the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 included a $2.7 million after-tax expense for a specific legal contingency. This combined benefit to the year-over-year increase in income from continuing operations in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 was partially offset by a $1.9 million after-tax increase in interest expense compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of financing the Linc acquisition.
NEW YORK, NY  June 7, 2011  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
"The strength of our acquired businesses, combined with our continued focus on job profitability, drove second quarter results, which came in as expected," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries Incorporated. "The quarter generated top and bottom line growth for the Company as we delivered our second consecutive quarter exceeding $1 billion in revenues and both income from continuing operations and adjusted income from continuing operations increased by double digits year-over-year. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by the companies we acquired in 2010, which together contributed nearly $200 million. We also achieved slight organic growth, both year-over-year and sequentially. Adjusted income from continuing operations increased 26% to $15 million while adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share increased 20% year-over-year to $0.28. The quarter also generated 43% growth in Adjusted EBITDA, which increased to $42 million compared to $29 million in the year-ago quarter."
"As with last quarter, all four Divisions produced revenue increases year-over-year. The acquisitions of The Linc Group, L&R Parking companies and Diversco continue to increase the Company's revenues and profitability while expanding our reach in key vertical markets. Engineering revenues increased by more than $135 million driven by The Linc Group, which also helped increase the Division's operating profit by more than 36%. Linc Government Services, however, was impacted by the delay in passing a federal budget that postponed the start of existing projects and delayed bidding and awarding of new contracts."
"Janitorial revenues grew through the combination of Diversco sales and strong revenue growth in the Northeast. Janitorial increased operating profit by more than 21% as a result of lower labor expense from one less work day in the quarter, which added $2.3 million after-tax, as well as the savings generated by the Division's regional consolidation. Parking revenues increased about 37% on the strength of $43 million in sales from the L&R companies. Parking's operating profit was down slightly as a result of a contract settlement and higher state unemployment insurance expenses in the quarter. Security revenues increased slightly with Diversco generating nearly $3 million. Security's operating profit was essentially flat year-over-year."
Slipsager concluded: "With the addition and successful integration of The Linc Group, Engineering continued to expand the number and scope of facility solutions we offer to reduce energy consumption and costs for clients ranging from colleges and universities to biotechnology centers and governments. Across all Divisions, we continued to win new business and expand existing businesses in key vertical markets, including financial services, health care, education, telecommunications, transportation and commercial real estate. We will continue to focus on and generate growth from the integrated facility services we deliver to our target vertical markets, leveraging our experience and expertise in meeting the distinct needs of these client sectors."
 
Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted income from continuing operations was $15.0 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations of $11.9 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $42.0 million, a 43.1% increase compared to $29.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Net cash from continuing operations was $31.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 compared to $50.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to the timing of both collections received from clients and payments made on vendor invoices as well as an increase in cash taxes paid as a result of the runoff in the utilization of tax assets acquired in the 2007 OneSource acquisition.
The Company reported revenues for the six months ended April 30, 2011 of $2.09 billion, a 21.1% increase compared to year-ago revenues of $1.73 billion. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 was $22.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $21.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2010. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal year 2011 was $26.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $26.0 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2010. Adjusted EBITDA for the first six months of fiscal year 2011 was $77.7 million, a 25.3% increase compared to $62.0 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2010.
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a third quarter cash dividend of $0.14 per common share payable on August 1, 2011 to stockholders of record on July 7, 2011. This will be ABM's 181 consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
st
Guidance

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These factors include but are not limited to the following: (1) risks relating to our acquisition of Linc, including risks relating to reductions in government spending on outsourced services as well as payment delays, may adversely affect a significant portion of revenues generated by government contracts, and political and compliance risks, both domestically and abroad, may adversely impact our operations; (2) our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations; (3) intense competition can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (4) we are subject to volatility associated with high deductibles for certain insurable risks; (5) an increase in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (6) we provide our services pursuant to agreements which are generally cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice; (7) our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients; (8) we incur significant accounting and other control costs that reduce profitability; (9 ) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (10) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (11) financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect results; (12) we are subject to risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations and foreign exchange exposure; (13) our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash; (14) because we conduct our business through operating subsidiaries, we depend on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations; (15) that portion of our revenues which are generated from international operations are subject to political risks and changes in socio-economic conditions, laws and regulations, including labor, monetary and fiscal policies, which could negatively impact our ability to operate and grow our business in the international arena; (17) future declines or fluctuations in the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities that are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired could negatively impact our earnings; (18) uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our costs of borrowings, our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis, and our cash flow; (19) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect our results of operations; (20) an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (21) we are defendants in several class and representative actions or other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (22) since we are an attractive employer for recent migrs to this country and many of our jobs are filled by such, changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly adversely affect our labor force, operations and financial results as well as our reputation; (23) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; (24) federal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations; (25) we participate in multi-employer defined benefit plans that could result in substantial liabilities being incurred; and (26) natural disasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt our services.

The Company also presents guidance for fiscal year 2011, as adjusted. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the second quarter of fiscal years 2011 and 2010. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Exhibit 99.1
PRESS RELEASE
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations", and "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share" (or "Adjusted EPS"). Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
 
today announced revenues for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 of $1.08 billion, a 23.8% increase compared to third quarter of fiscal year 2010 revenues of $869.0 million. Income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $27.9 million, a 33.1% increase from $21.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. Income from continuing operations per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 increased 27.5% to $0.51 compared to income from continuing operations per diluted share of $0.40 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010. Income from continuing operations increased primarily as a result of a $4.7 million after-tax increase in Divisional operating profit, driven by the companies acquired in calendar 2010, $4.7 million related to a re-measurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits and $1.5 million after-tax from settling a dispute related to an acquisition. This year-over-year increase in income from continuing operations was partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense of $2.2 million after-tax and a $1.9 million after-tax increase in interest expense compared to the year-ago quarter.
NEW YORK, NY  September 8, 2011  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
"Our Divisions once again generated quarterly revenues exceeding $1 billion, driven by the companies we acquired last year, and including slight organic growth," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries. "All four Divisions produced higher revenues year-over-year, consistent with prior quarters in the 2011 fiscal year. The higher revenues helped the Divisions' combined operating profit, excluding corporate, increase 15% to more than $60.0 million. Janitorial operating profit increased 4.6%, despite year-over-year increases in fuel costs and state unemployment insurance expenses. Our Engineering and Parking segments generated double digit growth. Engineering profits were up 61.5%, reflecting the contribution from the Linc operations we acquired in the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Parking achieved year-over-year growth of 23.1%, primarily related to operating profit associated with lots acquired in the L&R acquisition. Even as we produced higher revenues and profit in the quarter, we also saw clear signs that the current slow to no growth economy is causing clients to take additional cost containment measures, leading to further price reductions in an already compressed market. This erosion, combined with the shift in revenues from delayed federal appropriations, impacts our view of the fourth quarter."
"In the third quarter, net income and adjusted income from continuing operations both increased to nearly $28 million and $0.51 per diluted share as items impacting comparability did not significantly influence the quarter's results. As noted, our results included the $4.7 million related to a re-measurement of certain unrecognized tax benefits compared to the year-ago quarter, partially offset by the $2.2 million after-tax increase in share-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBIDTA increased to $54.9 million, up nearly 20%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin increased sequentially 114 basis points to 5.1%. We grew our cash from continuing operations, increasing nearly 45% to $51.0 million, compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2010."
Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted income from continuing operations was $27.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations of $22.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.
The Company's adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability) for the third quarter of fiscal year 2011 was $54.9 million, a 19.7% increase compared to $45.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.
Net cash from continuing operations was $51.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, a 44.9% increase compared to $35.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2010.
 
The Company reported revenues for the nine months ended July 31, 2011 of $3.17 billion, driven by the companies acquired in calendar 2010, a 22.0% increase compared to year-ago revenues of $2.59 billion. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 was $50.5 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared to $42.4 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 was $54.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $47.9 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010. Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011 was $132.7 million, a 22.9% increase compared to $108.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010. Net cash from continuing operation increased to $82.6 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011, a 13.1% increase compared to $73.0 million for the first nine months of fiscal year 2010.
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.14 per common share payable on November 7, 2011 to stockholders of record on October 6, 2011. This will be ABM's 182 consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
nd
Guidance
Slipsager concluded: "Through the first two quarters, our performance was essentially in line with our expectations. During the third quarter, it became clear that the U.S. economy will be weaker than anticipated, impacting our clients and resulting in further price compression, particularly in our Janitorial business. Further, as we have previously discussed, the delay in passing federal appropriations had an adverse impact on the timing of awarding contracts to Linc Government Services, which we expect to shift the start of projects from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2012. Taken together, along with higher unemployment insurance expense and fuel and related costs, we are lowering our expectations for the fourth quarter."
The Company now estimates that income from continuing operations per diluted share for the full 2011 fiscal year will be in the lower end of the range of $1.23 to $1.33 and is revising the range for adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, to $1.32 to $1.42.

PRESS RELEASE
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations", and "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share" (or "Adjusted EPS"). Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
today announced financial results for the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and full year. Revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 reached a record $1.08 billion, a 20% increase compared to fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 revenues of $901.4 million, driven primarily by acquisitions. Income from continuing operations for the quarter was $18.2 million compared to $21.4 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of increased labor expense from one additional workday as
NEW YORK, NY  December 13, 2011  ABM Industries Incorporated (NYSE:ABM)
 
well as higher taxes from the reduced availability of employment-based tax credits compared to the year-ago quarter. Net cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 increased 9.4% to $74.2 million. For the full year, the Company reported a 21.5% increase in revenues to $4.2 billion compared to $3.5 billion for fiscal year 2010, driven by acquisitions. Income from continuing operations increased to $68.7 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to $63.9 million, or $1.21 per diluted share, for the 2010 fiscal year. Adjusted income from continuing operations increased to $75.0 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared to $70.5 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2010.
Fourth Quarter Results
"Even in the face of continuing economic headwinds, ABM continues to deliver strong results," said Henrik Slipsager, president and chief executive officer, ABM Industries. "The businesses we acquired helped drive a record $1.08 billion in quarterly revenues, our fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion and a 20% increase compared to the year-ago quarter. All four Divisions produced higher revenues year-over-year as the successful integration of the companies we acquired continues to help drive overall top line growth and increased profitability for the Company. Income in the quarter was impacted by the increased labor expense from one additional workday and higher taxes compared to the year-ago quarter. We achieved net cash flow from continuing operations of $74.2 million, a 9.4% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2010."
For the quarter, Janitorial revenue increased by 1.4% year-over-year while operating profit declined 8.4%, driven by higher labor costs resulting from the additional workday. Engineering revenues grew by 149.0% over the 2010 fourth quarter and profits by 41.4%, primarily reflecting the contributions of Linc. Parking revenues were 19.3% higher than the year-before quarter and profits were up by 11.2%, driven by results from the L&R acquisition. Security increased revenues by 3.1% while profit fell by 6.8%, primarily the result of price compression.
Year in Review
Slipsager added: The successful integration of Linc was one of the year's highlights and we are proud that, as promised, Linc was slightly accretive to ABM's earnings in fiscal 2011, excluding acquisition costs. For the year, each Division generated higher year-over-year revenues and profitability. On operating profit, Engineering grew by more than 45%, reflecting the contribution of Linc. Janitorial grew revenues and operating profit over 2010, despite the additional workday, higher state unemployment insurance expense and increased fuel costs for the year. As a result of our continued focus on our long-term strategy, we achieved an 18% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $184 million for the year, which reflects a doubling of adjusted EBITDA in the past four years, despite one of the worst economic periods in history."
"
"From a cash-flow perspective, we achieved one of our strongest fiscal years  including $156.8 million in cash flow from continuing operations," said executive vice president and chief financial officer James Lusk. "Also, we reduced borrowings since the Linc acquisition by more than $150 million to $300 million at October 31, 2011, and lowered our adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to approximately 1.6x from 2.5x."
Slipsager concluded: "We ended the year well-positioned as we have leveraged our acquisitions to increase sales, expand our service capabilities and extend our market reach. We look forward to the 2012 fiscal year to continue executing on our long-term strategic plans and launching new initiatives to drive future growth in key vertical markets."
 
Dividend
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.145 per common share  which is a 4% increase  payable on February 6, 2012 to stockholders of record on January 5, 2012. This will be ABM's 183 consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
rd
Guidance
Given the continuing macro-economic conditions, the Company is estimating that full fiscal year 2012 income from continuing operations per diluted share will be in the range of $1.26 to $1.36 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, will be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50. Fiscal year 2012 will have one extra day compared to fiscal 2011, which will occur in the 2012 third quarter and is expected to impact earnings per diluted share by $0.04 to $0.05. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 is expected to be in the range of 39% to 41%, from 35% in fiscal year 2011.

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These factors include but are not limited to the following: (1) our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations as we may not be able to achieve anticipated results from any given acquisition and activities relating to integrating the acquired business may divert management's focus on operational matters; (2) we are subject to intense competition that can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (3) any increases in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (4) we have high deductibles for certain insurable risks, and, therefore are subject to volatility associated with those risks; (5) we primarily provide our services pursuant to agreements which are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice; (6) our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients; (7) our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to compliance with both U.S. and foreign laws; (8) we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures and our ability to do business may be affected by the failure of our joint venture partners to perform their obligations or the improper conduct of employees, joint venture partners or agents; (9) significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our government contracts may negatively affect our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows; (10) we incur significant accounting and other control costs that reduce profitability; (11) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (12) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, could reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (13) financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect our results; (14) our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash; (15) future declines in the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities could negatively impact our earnings; (16) uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our costs of borrowing, our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and our cash flow; (17) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect out results of operations; (18) an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (19) we are defendants in a number of class and representative actions or other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (20) federal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations; (21) changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly adversely affect our labor force, operations and financial results; (22) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; (23) we participate in multi-employer defined benefit plans which could result in substantial liabilities being incurred; and (24) natural disasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt services.
Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties the Company faces is contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2010 and in other reports the Company files from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, the Company has presented income from continuing operations, as adjusted for items impacting comparability, for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal years 2011 and 2010. The Company also presents guidance for fiscal year 2012, as adjusted. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends as well as ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal years 2011 and 2010. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)

Net income benefitted from a reduction in transaction costs and sustained improvement in historical credits on client receivables partially offset by higher payroll-related expenses. Net cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter increased to $11.8 million compared to $0.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the fiscal 2012 first quarter was essentially flat at $11.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $11.7 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Adjusted EBITDA in the 2012 first quarter was $35.9 million compared to $35.7 million one year ago.

First Quarter Results and Impacts
"Our financial results for the quarter were in line with our expectations and consistent with last year," ABM's president and chief executive officer Henrik Slipsager said. "Facility Solutions (combined Linc and ABM Engineering operations) and Security generated year-over year increases in revenues, combined with essentially flat sales for Parking and Janitorial. Janitorial achieved slight growth from sustained improvement in billing processes and cost control measures partially offset by higher state unemployment insurance expense. Margins in Facility Solutions were lower than last year, primarily as a result of the comparative mix and timing of government projects. Total expenses as a percentage of revenues held steady as gross margins remained essentially flat year-over-year."
James Lusk, executive vice president and chief financial officer, added: "The Company benefitted from investments we have made in improved infrastructure, operations and end-to-end processes as well as gains from prior tax-related investments. We were pleased with the strength of our net cash flow from continuing operations, which increased by $11.5 million compared to the year-ago quarter."
Operations Review
Operating profit increased to $17.8 million pre-tax in the 2012 first quarter compared to $16.9 million pre-tax in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. Operating profit in the first quarter of 2012 included a $2.9 million pre-tax increase in payroll-related expenses associated with higher federal and state unemployment insurance rates partially offset by a $2.7 million pre-tax benefit related to sustained improvement in historical credits on client receivables.
Slipsager said: "Our operations are achieving success with our vertical market strategies to grow business  as we closed more than $100 million in new contracts during the first quarter alone. We continue to benefit from the acquisition and integration of the former Linc business, particularly in the Energy sector, where we see increasing client demand, growth opportunity and new business. We enhanced our capabilities by focusing ABM Energy on implementing energy technologies designed to reduce clients' energy consumption and operating costs while meeting the growing demand within the green and sustainable building market. Further, our industry-leading green cleaning capabilities played a part in helping us secure a global partnership with AEG, a world leader in sports and entertainment that is committed to environmentally safe products and services. The global partnership will expand the facility cleaning services we already provide to a number of marquee AEG venues. Underpinning these vertical market strategies, we also recently launched a new ABM brand that we will begin implementing globally. The new brand captures and conveys the breadth of services we now offer our clients. Many of these capabilities are on display on our rebranded website  where our clients, employees and others can connect to our new, interactive "Metropolis." These strategies and initiatives will help us firmly establish our position as a leader in delivering integrated facilities solutions to our clients across multiple industries and geographies."
Dividend
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.145 per common share payable on May 7, 2012 to stockholders of record on April 5, 2012. This will be ABM's 184
th
consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
Guidance
The Company reaffirms that full fiscal year 2012 income from continuing operations per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $1.26 to $1.36 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share, for the same period, is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50. Fiscal year 2012 will have one extra day compared to fiscal 2011, which will occur in the third quarter, and is expected to negatively impact earnings per diluted share by $0.04 to $0.05. In addition, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 is expected to be in the range of 39% to 42%, compared to 35% in fiscal year 2011.

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
This press release contains forward-looking statements that set forth management's anticipated results based on management's current plans and assumptions. Any number of factors could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These factors include but are not limited to the following: (1) we may not be able to achieve anticipated global growth due to various factors, including, but not limited to, an inability to make strategic acquisitions or compete internationally; our acquisition strategy may adversely impact our results of operations as we may not be able to achieve anticipated results from any given acquisition; and activities relating to integrating an acquired business may divert management's focus on operational matters; (2) we are subject to intense competition that can constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability; (3) any increases in costs that we cannot pass on to clients could affect our profitability; (4) we have high deductibles for certain insurable risks and, therefore, are subject to volatility associated with those risks; (5) we primarily provide our services pursuant to agreements which are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days' notice; (6) our success depends on our ability to preserve our long-term relationships with clients; (7) our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to compliance with both U.S. and foreign laws; (8) we conduct some of our operations through joint ventures and our ability to do business may be affected by the failure of our joint venture partners to perform their obligations or the improper
conduct of employees, joint venture partners or agents; (9) significant delays or reductions in appropriations for our government contracts may negatively affect our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows; (10) we incur significant accounting and other control costs that reduce profitability; (11) a decline in commercial office building occupancy and rental rates could affect our revenues and profitability; (12) deterioration in economic conditions in general could further reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, could reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (13) financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect our results; (14) our ability to operate and pay our debt obligations depends upon our access to cash; (15) future declines in the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities could negatively impact our earnings; (16) uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our costs of borrowing, our ability to collect receivables on a timely basis and our cash flow; (17) any future increase in the level of debt or in interest rates can affect our results of operations; (18) an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (19) we are defendants in a number of class and representative actions or other lawsuits alleging various claims that could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (20) federal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations; (21) changes in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly adversely affect our labor force, operations and financial results; (22) labor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations; (23) we participate in multi-employer defined benefit plans which could result in substantial liabilities being incurred; and (24) natural disasters or acts of terrorism could disrupt services.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ABM INDUSTRIES ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER 2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
, a leading provider of integrated facility solutions, today announced financial results for the fiscal 2012 second quarter that ended April 30, 2012.
New York, NY  June 6, 2012
 ABM (NYSE:ABM)
 
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations", and "Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share" (or "Adjusted EPS"). Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Highlights of the Company's fiscal 2012 second quarter include:
 
 
 
 
Second Quarter Results and Recent Events
"Operating results were in line with our expectations with the exception of government and government-related businesses. Adjusted income from continuing operations was up 9% as we maintained our focus on cost control measures and benefited from employment-based tax credits due to our hiring practices," said ABM's president and chief executive officer Henrik Slipsager. "Net Income was adversely impacted by legal settlements we made to mitigate long-term risks. We generated revenues from new clients and expanded services to existing clients in the Janitorial and Security segments. Janitorial benefited from client wins in the high-technology sector, although overall the segment was negatively affected by the delayed timing of starting recently signed jobs. New business in Security generated a 6% increase in revenue and along with cost reductions drove a 13% increase in operating profit. Despite lower year-over-year revenues in Parking, we increased margins due to an improved mix of work performed and select cost reductions. Our Facility Solutions segment continues to be impacted by the timing of government contracts and the postponement of the start of existing projects."
James Lusk, executive vice president and chief financial officer, added, "The Company's strong cash flow generation, which was up over 36%, enabled us to continue to reduce debt levels and we ended the second quarter with $266 million of borrowings under our credit facility, down $27 million from $293 million in the prior quarter."
Operating profit for the fiscal 2012 second quarter was $18.9 million, a $7.6 million decrease from $26.5 million in the same period last year due primarily to the settlement of certain legal matters totaling $5.1 million, thereby eliminating the ongoing expense and distraction of prolonged litigation. In addition, higher state unemployment rates led to an increase of $2.5 million in payroll related expenses.
Interest expense for the fiscal 2012 second quarter was $2.4 million, a $1.9 million decrease from $4.3 million in the same period last year due to lower average borrowings and average interest rates on the Company's credit facility. The Company's income tax expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 decreased by $3.0 million compared to $8.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. The effective tax rates in the second quarter of fiscal year 2012 and 2011 were 33.3 % and 38.3%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate during the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was primarily due to discrete adjustments for employment-based tax credits recognized during the quarter. The anticipated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2012 remains in the range of 39% to 41%.
 
Slipsager concluded, "I am pleased with the additional business won during the quarter as clients continue responding favorably to our industry leading integrated facilities solutions. We have signed over $150 million in new contracts for the first half of fiscal 2012, although the effect of these contracts will not be evident until later in 2012 and beyond. Excluding our government business, we are encouraged by the momentum building in our Facility Solutions division, particularly in the energy sector, which achieved growth over 10% in the quarter due to increasing client demand and new business. We are taking a number of steps to expand our capabilities and depth of operations in our Building and Energy Services unit. Looking long-term, we continue to believe Integrated Facility Solutions, and in particular the energy segment, will be one of the growth engines for ABM."
Six Months Results
The Company reported revenues for the six months ended April 30, 2012 of $2.13 billion, a 2.0% increase compared to year-ago revenues of $2.09 billion. Income from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2012 was $22.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to $22.6 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2011.
Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal year 2012 was $28.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared to $26.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2011. The increase of $1.3 million is the result of a $1.9 million after-tax decrease in interest expense due to lower average borrowings and interest rates, a $1.7 million after-tax sales allowance reserve reduction primarily driven by sustained improvements in historical and expected credits on clients receivables, and a $0.8 million decrease in income tax expense, partially offset by a $3.0 million after-tax increase in payroll related expenses associated with higher federal and state unemployment insurance rates.
Dividend
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a third quarter cash dividend of $0.145 per common share payable on August 6, 2012 to stockholders of record on July 5, 2012. This will be ABM's 185
th
consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
Guidance
ABM reaffirmed its guidance of fiscal year 2012 income from continuing operations per diluted share of $1.26 to $1.36 and adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share of $1.40 to $1.50. As a result of the fiscal year calendar, 2012 will have one extra day compared to fiscal 2011. The extra day will occur in the third quarter and is expected to negatively impact earnings per diluted share by $0.03 to $0.05

Item 7.01. Regulation FD Disclosure
The Company is a defendant in the previously reported consolidated cases of Augustus, Hall and Davis v. American Commercial Security Services filed on July 12, 2005 in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County (the "Augustus case"). The Augustus case is a class action involving allegations that the Company violated certain state laws relating to meal and rest breaks. As previously disclosed, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on the rest break claim seeking damages in the amount of $103.0 million. On July 6, 2012, the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County (the "Superior Court") heard plaintiffs' motion for damages on the rest break claim and the Company's motion to decertify the class. The Superior Court denied the Company's motion and awarded plaintiffs damages. The Company anticipates that the amount of the award will be in excess of $89 million. This amount does not include plaintiffs' counsel's fees. The Company strongly disagrees with the decisions of the Superior Court, firmly believes that it has complied with applicable law, and intends to vigorously appeal these decisions.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
, a leading provider of integrated facility solutions, today announced financial results for the fiscal 2012 third quarter that ended July 31, 2012.
New York, NY  September 5, 2012
 ABM (NYSE:ABM)
 
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "adjusted income from continuing operations", and "adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share" (or "adjusted EPS"). Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Executive Summary:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third Quarter Results and Recent Events
"Our third quarter operational results were disappointing and fell short of our expectations primarily due to a shortfall of $25 million in expected sales in the quarter for our Government business and no contribution from the DLITE (Defense Language Interpretation and Translation Enterprises) program to date," said ABM's president and chief executive officer Henrik Slipsager. "We generated higher revenues in our Janitorial, Security and Parking segments and continue to build momentum in our energy business, but the profit from this growth was offset by the impact of lower government spending in our Facility Solutions segment and the additional day of labor expense in Janitorial. Excluding the government business, our consolidated revenue grew approximately 1.5% and our Facility Solutions segment produced an approximately 8% increase in operating profit. Janitorial slightly increased organic revenues year-over-year and their operating profit was essentially flat excluding the $3.7 million adverse impact from the additional working day. Parking and Security had solid third quarter performance, producing increases in both revenue and operating profit. Although sales momentum isn't progressing at the pace we had early anticipated, we continue to make good progress in a number of verticals with recent client wins in high-technology and aviation, and our building and energy solutions business achieved organic sales growth of 10%."
James Lusk, executive vice president and chief financial officer, added, "The Company's strong cash flow generation year-to-date has enabled us to reduce debt levels by $48 million since the end of fiscal 2011 and to continue to return value to shareholders through the payment of a quarterly cash dividend. We ended the third quarter with $252 million of borrowings under our $650 million credit facility, down from $365 million in the prior year period and $300 million at the end of fiscal 2011."
Operating profit for the fiscal 2012 third quarter was $23.2 million, a $17.5 million decrease from $40.7 million in the same period last year. The decline is primarily due to a $13.3 million ($7.8 million after-tax) increase in insurance expense and a $3.7 million ($2.2 million after-tax) increase in labor expenses resulting from one additional work day in the quarter.
Interest expense for the fiscal 2012 third quarter was $2.4 million, a $1.7 million decrease from $4.1 million in the third quarter of 2011 due to lower average borrowings and average interest rates on the Company's credit facility.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 was 41.3%, compared to 26.1% in the same period last year. The tax provision for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 included a discrete benefit of $4.7 million.
 
Slipsager continued, "We began fiscal 2012 with great sales momentum, but have been unable to overcome the impact of the general weakness in the economy on our top and bottom lines. While we are pleased with the growth of our Parking and Security segments in the quarter, our Janitorial and a portion of our Facility Solutions businesses have been increasingly affected by the lackluster economic recovery and slowdown in government spending, which has dampened our overall expectations for the remainder of the year. We remain highly encouraged by our energy business, which we acquired in the Linc acquisition, as clients continue to put a greater emphasis on energy efficiency to reduce costs and improve operations and we believe that our building and energy services business is well positioned to capitalize on this significant long-term market opportunity."
Nine Months Results
The Company reported revenues for the nine months ended July 31, 2012 of $3.21 billion, a 1.4% increase compared to year-ago revenues of $3.17 billion. Income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 was $35.0 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to $50.5 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011.
Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2012 was $48.4 million, or $0.88 per diluted share, compared to $54.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2011. The decrease of $6.2 million in adjusted income from operations is primarily the result of lower income from operations of $4.4 million due to the continuing impact of price compression and government-related contract losses, and an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses associated with higher federal and state unemployment insurance rates, and one additional working day.
Strategy Update
Slipsager concluded, "We continue to focus on the long-term strategic goals we announced in fiscal 2011. When balanced against persistent economic pressures and a very aggressive pricing environment, we decided additional steps are needed to reposition our operations and improve our competitive position. By leveraging our incumbent client relationships and focusing our Mobile and On-Demand Services model on mid-market opportunities, we expect to drive additional business in our higher margin and high-growth sectors."
Share Repurchase Program
The Company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized up to $50 million share repurchase program. Under this repurchase program, the Company may purchase its common shares from time to time in open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions and may make all or part of the purchases pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and the repurchases may be discontinued at any time. As of August 30, 2012, the Company had approximately 54 million shares outstanding.
"This $50 million share repurchase program reflects our commitment to returning capital to shareholders and reflects our confidence in ABM's long-term outlook," said James Lusk.
Dividend
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.145 per common share payable on November 5, 2012 to stockholders of record on October 4, 2012. This will be ABM's 186
th
consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
Guidance
Based on the weaker macroeconomic environment and continued shortfall in Government spending, ABM is lowering guidance for fiscal year 2012 adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share to $1.36 to $1.42. The Company is also revising income from continuing operations per diluted share to $1.08 to $1.14. In addition, the Company is awaiting a potentially favorable decision on a matter related to a prior acquisition. This one-time net benefit of $0.11 per diluted share is included in the Company's guidance.

Executive Summary:
 
 
 
 
 
Fourth Quarter Results and Recent Events
"Our fourth quarter and fiscal year-end operational results were in-line with our revised guidance and cash flow from operations was again very strong," said ABM's president and chief executive officer Henrik Slipsager. "On a year-over-year basis, we generated higher revenues on a consolidated basis as we benefited from new business in Janitorial, Security and Parking. Revenue for Facility Solutions continued to be negatively impacted by diminished sales to the U.S. Government, which decreased 34% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding the government business, consolidated revenue grew approximately 2.6%."
Slipsager continued, "Operating profit for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter was $36.7 million, a $3.3 million or 9.9% increase from $33.4 million in the same period last year. The increase in operating profit is primarily due to new business in the Janitorial and Facility Solutions segments. For the quarter, Facility Solutions achieved a 13.2% increase in operating profit compared to fiscal 2011. Cash flow from operations continued to be strong with ABM generating $66.8 million for the fourth quarter and $150.6 million for the fiscal year. This marks the third consecutive year the company generated cash flow from operations of $150 million or more. A significant achievement, especially when you consider cash flow from operations was $68 million in fiscal 2008."
James Lusk, executive vice president and chief financial officer, added, "The Company's strong cash flow generation for the fiscal year enabled us to reduce debt levels by $85 million since the end of fiscal 2011 and to continue to return value to shareholders through the payment of a quarterly cash dividend. After fiscal year-end, we closed three strategic acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $199 million. These transactions were funded by borrowings under our $650 million credit facility and excluding transaction and integration costs, are expected to be slightly accretive for fiscal 2013."
Interest expense for the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter was $2.3 million, a $1.0 million decrease from $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates on the Company's credit facility.
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 was 21.8%, compared to 41.8% in the same period last year. As previously communicated, the tax provision for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 included a one-time discrete tax benefit.
Slipsager observed, "Fiscal 2012 results were adversely impacted by the early withdrawal of troops from Iraq and one additional workday, which negatively impacts the Janitorial segment because of fixed price contracts, compared to fiscal 2011. Despite this, we ended the fiscal year with improved operational results and sales as we continued to focus on managing operating margins and building on investments we made in a number of key initiatives to drive long-term growth."
Fiscal 2012 Results
The Company reported revenues for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2012 of $4.30 billion, a 1.3% increase compared to year-ago revenues of $4.25 billion. Income from continuing operations for the fiscal year 2012 was $62.7 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, compared to $68.7 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, for the fiscal year 2011.
 
Adjusted income from continuing operations for the fiscal year 2012 was $76.1 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, essentially flat, compared to $75.0 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, for the fiscal year 2011.
Strategy Update
Slipsager concluded, "We continue to focus on our long-term strategic goals and are pleased with the progress we are making. The recent acquisitions of Air Serv and HHA along with our initial steps to streamline internal assets and focus resources on vertical markets are improving our long-term growth prospects. The acquisition of Air Serv strengthens ABM's position in the aviation vertical with over $650 million in annual revenue and their European operations will serve as a strategic base as we seek to expand our global presence in other verticals. With the HHA transaction, ABM has consolidated and strengthened our healthcare capabilities considerably. These acquisitions along with the investments and acquisitions we have made in our on-demand and mobile businesses uniquely position ABM to meet the long-term growth opportunities in the facility services industry."
Dividend
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a first quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per common share  which is a 3.5% increasepayable on December 28, 2012 to stockholders of record on December 21, 2012. This will be ABM's 187th consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
Outlook
At this time, given the economic and government spending uncertainties relating to possible sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011, commonly referred to as the "fiscal cliff", the Company is not providing guidance for fiscal year 2013. The Company anticipates providing guidance in March 2013, when it reports results of its first fiscal quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
, a leading provider of integrated facility solutions, today announced financial results for the fiscal 2013 first quarter that ended January 31, 2013.
New York, NY  March 4, 2013
 ABM (NYSE:ABM)
 
 
(This release refers to non-GAAP financial measures described as "Adjusted EBITDA", "Adjusted income from continuing operations", and "Adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share" (or "Adjusted EPS"). Refer to the accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures.)
Executive Summary:
 
 
 
 
 
 
First Quarter Results and Recent Events
"We are encouraged by our first quarter operational results," said ABM's president and chief executive officer Henrik Slipsager. "Sales from our newly-acquired Air Serv Corporation, HHA Services and Calvert-Jones businesses and organic growth in our Janitorial, ABM Facility Services and Security segments produced a 10% revenue gain for the quarter. ABM Facility Services and Security showed strong organic revenue growth of 8% and 5%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2012 as they continue to benefit from new sales. The Building & Energy Solutions segment was impacted by lower revenue of $17.6 million primarily as a result of the comparative mix and timing of certain awarded and completed U.S. Government contracts. Our pipeline of future business is trending very well across all operating segments and we are seeing some positive signs in our government business. We were recently awarded two linguist task orders by the Department of Defense under the Defense Language Interpreting and Translation Enterprise (DLITE) contract, which are expected to contribute to second quarter revenues. In addition, in February we signed a $25 million energy retrofit contract with Wright State University, which demonstrates our unique capabilities of providing clients with cost efficient and green long-term solutions to their facility service needs."
Slipsager continued, "Adjusted income from continuing operations was up $2.9 million or 25% as we benefited from the recent acquisitions, the retroactive reinstatement of employment-based tax credits, and new sales. I am pleased Congress voted to extend the Workers Opportunity Tax Credit and that our hiring practices enabled the Company to realize a $2.9 million tax benefit associated with fiscal 2012 employee hires in our fiscal first quarter of 2013. In addition, on a comparative basis, the first quarter of 2012 included a $1.6 million after-tax benefit related to the improvement in historical credits on client receivables. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7.5% to $38.6 million and excluding the one-time benefit from historical credits in 2012, increased 16.3%."
James Lusk, executive vice president and chief financial officer, added, "With the closing of three acquisitions in the first quarter, our debt levels increased by over $200 million from the end of fiscal 2012. Net cash used in continuing operating activities was $11.5 million in the three months ended January 31, 2013 and was consistent with our expectations. Typically, total operating cash flows in the first quarter are lower than the remaining subsequent quarters. We continue to target working capital improvements and believe that, with our strong balance sheet, we are positioned to support and fund our longer term strategic investments and initiatives."
 
Interest expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was $3.3 million, a $0.5 million increase from $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2012 due to higher average borrowings on the Company's credit facility to fund recent acquisitions.
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 was 22.2%, compared to 41.2% in the same period last year, reflecting the retroactive application of employment-based tax credits from calendar 2012 that were recognized during the quarter. The anticipated effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 is now in the range of 36% to 38%.
Slipsager concluded, "We are enthusiastic about the opportunities for our next phase of growth. We intend to leverage our recently acquired businesses to expand both our global footprint and move ABM's business towards industry verticals. While we are early in the integration process, we are pleased with the pace of integration and sales contributions of our newly acquired companies. In order to realize the long term growth opportunities in facility services and improve our financial performance, we continue to invest in realigning our infrastructure and operations, as well as strategic initiatives, which we believe will grow the overall demand for our businesses. "
Dividend
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a second quarter cash dividend of $0.15 per common share payable on May 6, 2013 to stockholders of record on April 4, 2013. This will be ABM's 188th consecutive quarterly cash dividend.
Outlook
At this time, based on the Company's operational results for the first quarter and its current expectations, the Company is providing guidance for Income from Continuing Operations of $1.16 to $1.26 per diluted share for fiscal year 2013 and Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations of $1.35 to $1.45 per diluted share for fiscal 2013.

Executive Summary:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second Quarter Results and Recent Events
"We are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which highlights our success in driving top and bottom line growth," said ABM's president and chief executive officer Henrik Slipsager. "Our 11% increase in revenue was due to the strength of our acquired businesses and organic growth from our Janitorial, Facility Services and Security segments. I am encouraged by the fact Janitorial surpassed 2% organic growth and Facility Services achieved another quarter above 8%. Sales in the Building & Energy Solutions segment increased 8.4% due to acquisitions. With recent project wins, a strong sales pipeline, and an improving economy, the Company is well positioned for sustained growth. We were recently selected as the official cleaning services partner of The O2 in London, one of the world's largest and most notable entertainment destinations. In addition, during the second quarter, we entered into a joint venture with Building Energy, an Italian-based independent power producer, significantly expanding our solar and distributed energy capabilities in large-scale commercial and utility-scale solar power markets."
Slipsager continued, "Adjusted income from continuing operations improved $3.9 million, or nearly 24%, due to contributions from the recent acquisitions and new sales. As expected, we received an approximately $0.04 per diluted share benefit from lower labor expense as a result of one less working day in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, although this was largely offset by a higher tax rate of 39.2% compared to 33.3% in the second quarter of 2012. The quarter also generated over 28% growth in Adjusted EBITDA, which increased to $52.0 million compared to $40.5 million in the year-ago quarter. On a reported basis, we achieved a 65% increase in net income, partially due to a $3.2 million after-tax reduction in legal fees compared to the prior year."
James Lusk, executive vice president and chief financial officer, added, "The Company's strong cash flow generation in the second quarter, which on a year-over-year basis was up 13% to $49.3 million, enabled us to reduce debt levels and we ended the second quarter with $384 million of borrowings under our credit facility, down $39 million from $423 million in the prior quarter."
Interest expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $3.0 million, an increase from $2.4 million in the second quarter of 2012 due to higher average borrowings on the Company's credit facility to fund recent acquisitions.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was 39.2%, compared to 33.3% in the same period last year, primarily due to discrete adjustments for employment-based tax credits recognized during the second quarter of fiscal 2012.
 
Slipsager concluded, "We are continuing to lay the foundation for more revenue and profit growth in the future and look forward to sequential improvement in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Our recently acquired businesses are exceeding expectations and we are leveraging these investments and our core businesses to pursue growth opportunities in new sales, vertical markets and client expansion. With our efforts to rebrand and realign the business to better capture these market opportunities and increase productivity, our team is making progress collaborating on sales leads and in cross selling our services, particularly in the South Central region, where the integration and consolidation initiatives are well underway. We expect to begin reorganizing our Northeastern and Midwest markets in the third quarter and remain on track to reduce expenses by $3.5 million to $4.0 million in fiscal 2013. As previously communicated, we are investing these savings in our sales organization and in key initiatives we have developed to drive future growth."
Six Months Results
The Company reported revenues for the six months ended April 30, 2013 of $2.36 billion, which represents a 10.5% increase compared to year-ago revenues of $2.13 billion. The growth was driven by a combination of $198.0 million from the recent acquisitions and organic growth in the first half of fiscal 2013 in the Janitorial, Facility Services, and Security segments.
Income from continuing operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2013 was $32.7 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to $22.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2012.
Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first half of fiscal year 2013 was $34.9 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared to $28.0 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the first six months of fiscal year 2012.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, the Company has presented income from continuing operations, as adjusted for items impacting comparability, for the second quarter and six months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends as well as ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding discontinued operations and items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the second quarter and six months of fiscal years 2013 and 2012. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. (See accompanying financial tables for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to certain GAAP financial measures.)
