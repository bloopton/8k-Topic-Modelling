     AFLAC Incorporated announced today that it has received a formal proposal regarding funding for Japan's life insurance policyholder protection fund. The proposal was drafted by the Financial Services Agency and submitted to AFLAC through the Life Insurance Association of Japan (LIAJ) and Japan's Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC).      Despite AFLAC's intention to vote against the proposal, the Company expects it to pass when members of the LIPPC vote on December 27, 2002. If the proposal passes, AFLAC will take an after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 of approximately $21 million, or $.04 per diluted share, for its estimated portion of the additional industry contribution.      AFLAC Incorporated also announced today that it sees better-than-expected operating earnings growth for 2002. Throughout the year the Company has maintained a 2002 objective of 15% growth in operating earnings per diluted share excluding the impact of currency translation. However, with the continued favorable sales and claims trends in its insurance operations, AFLAC now expects that rate of growth to approach 18% for the year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
COLUMBUS, Georgia - December 23, 2002 -- AFLAC Incorporated announced today that it has received a formal proposal regarding funding for Japan's life insurance policyholder protection fund. The proposal was drafted by the Financial Services Agency and submitted to AFLAC through the Life Insurance Association of Japan (LIAJ) and Japan's Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC).
The proposal calls for an extension of the Japanese government's pledge to enact fiscal measures of up to 400 billion yen until March 31, 2006, and for the industry to contribute an additional 78 billion yen to the LIPPC. In addition to the bankruptcy laws that allow for the rehabilitation of life insurers, these funds would be used to support policyholder obligations of a failed life insurance company. Despite AFLAC's intention to vote against the proposal, the company expects it to pass when members of the LIPPC vote on December 27, 2002. If the proposal passes, AFLAC will take an after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2002 of approximately $21 million, or $.04 per diluted share, for its estimated portion of the additional industry contribution.
Commenting on the government's proposal, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos said: "We commend the government for its decision to extend its financial commitment to the protection fund. However, we are deeply disappointed in its decision to request additional contributions from the industry. We believe the industry has already done more than its share, and AFLAC should not have to pay for other companies' mistakes. We urge the government to quickly enact measures that would establish a more efficient, sustainable safety-net system for the benefit of the life insurance industry and its policyholders.
"Despite our displeasure with this proposal, we continue to view Japan as a vast and desirable market for affordable supplemental insurance products, and we believe that AFLAC is in the best position to capitalize on that opportunity. Most importantly, we remain confident about the outlook for AFLAC's financial performance. Throughout this year we have maintained a 2002 objective of 15% growth in operating earnings per diluted share excluding the impact of currency translation. However, with the continued favorable sales and claims trends in our insurance operations, we now expect that rate of growth to approach 18% this year. And based on that expectation and a year-to-date exchange rate of roughly 126 yen to the dollar, we believe reported 2002 operating earnings will be approximately $1.56 per diluted share, excluding the charge for the policyholder protection fund. We also remain focused on increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15% to 17% excluding currency translation in 2003, and by 15% be fore the effect of the yen in 2004. We believe that our growth targets are realistic and achievable and reflect the underlying strength of our business in the United States and Japan."

          99 - News release from AFLAC Incorporated dated January 30, 2003.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia - January 30, 2003 -- AFLAC Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results. Total revenues were $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or 10.9% higher than the fourth quarter of 2001. Net earnings were $186 million, or $.35 per diluted share, compared with $163 million, or $.31 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002 reflected a charge of $26 million, or $.05 per diluted share, for our estimated portion of a life insurance industry assessment for Japan's policyholder protection fund. Net earnings also included a loss of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In addition, net earnings included realized investment losses of $4 million, or $.01 per diluted share. In the year-ago quarter, net earnings included a loss of $18 million, or $.03 per diluted share, due to SFAS 133 and realized investment losses of $1 million. For the year, total revenues were $10.3 billion. Net earnings were $821 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared with $687 million, or $1.28 per share, in 2001. In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. The company believes the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. The company's definition of operating earnings excludes the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses, the impact of SFAS 133, and in 2002, the charge for the Japanese policyholder protection fund. The company also assesses its financial performance by looking at operating earnings excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $221 million, compared with $182 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 23.5% to $.42 per diluted share, compared with $.34 per share in the fourth quarter of 2001. The effect of the yen/dollar exchange rate on fourth quarter operating earnings per diluted share was negligible. For the year, operating earnings were $825 million, compared with $720 million a year ago. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 16.4% from $1.34 to $1.56 in 2002. Excluding the $.02 per share negative impact from the weaker yen for the full year, operating earnings per diluted share rose 17.9%. Pending approval by the board of directors, AFLAC will increase its quarterly cash dividend for the 21st consecutive year. Effective with the first quarter of 2003, the company intends to raise the quarterly cash dividend 16.7%, from $.06 to $.07 per share. At its meeting on February 11, 2003, the board of directors will consider the dividend increase. If approved, the first quarter dividend will be payable on March 3, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2003. Commenting on the company's results for the fourth quarter and the year, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are very proud of our marketing performance and financial results in 2002. In Japan, we faced a challenge of quickly renewing our sales growth following disappointing sales in 2001. We not only met that challenge, we significantly beat our sales targets in every quarter of the year. In the United States, our challenge was to extend our momentum of strong sales increases. Despite difficult comparisons to 2001, AFLAC U.S. produced better-than-expected sales. And in both markets, our investment activities and claims trends were favorable vis--vis our expectations. Quite simply, 2002 was a year in which virtually everything went right. As a result, we were most pleased to exceed our primary financial objective for increasing operating earnings per share growth in 2002. "In looking ahead, we are equally excited about the outlook for continued earnings growth. In May 2001, we established a 2003 objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15% to 17% before the impact of currency translation. We believe we will produce results within that range and look for operating earnings per diluted share to be up 15% for this year excluding currency translation. For 2004, our objective is also to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding the impact of the yen. We view those targets as realistic and achievable. Ultimately, we believe they reflect the vast opportunities we see in Japan and the United States and our leading position in the two largest insurance markets in the world." AFLAC Incorporated (NYSE - AFL) is an international holding company. A company, AFLAC insures more than 40 million people worldwide. It is a leading writer of insurance products marketed at the worksite in the United States, offering policies to employees at 248,100 payroll accounts.

          99 - Press release of AFLAC Incorporated dated April 23, 2003.

EXHIBIT 99
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia -- April 23, 2003 -- AFLAC Incorporated today reported its first quarter results. Total revenues, which benefited from foreign currency translation, were $2.8 billion in the first quarter, or 18.4% higher than a year ago. Net earnings, which also reflected the stronger yen to the dollar during the quarter, were $237 million, or $.45 per diluted share, compared with $183 million, or $.34 per diluted share, a year ago. In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Our definition of operating earnings, as presented in this press release, excludes the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133. Operating earnings were a record $244 million, compared with $192 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 27.8% to $.46 per diluted share, compared with $.36 per share in the first quarter of 2002. Excluding the benefit of $.02 per share from the stronger yen to the dollar, operating earnings per share increased 22.2% for the quarter. The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.07 per share is payable on June 2, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 15, 2003. Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, we are pleased with our results for the first three months of the year. We were especially excited that operating earnings per share growth before currency translation significantly exceeded our annual target of 15% growth. "AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales were above our expectations in the first quarter, rising 12.1% to 27.0 billion yen, or $227 million. These sales results compare favorably to the single-digit growth we had expected. Like last year, our sales benefited from the continued strong demand for medical-related products. Our new stand-alone medical policy and our popular medical riders combined to account for more than 55% of new sales. We believe this is a direct reflection of our ability to develop products that meet the changing needs of consumers and provide the best product value in the marketplace. As we look ahead, we believe the aging population in Japan will lead to continued demand for the kind of affordable insurance products that AFLAC offers. And with the many competitive strengths
that we bring to the market, we believe AFLAC Japan is in a great position to fill that demand. For the full year, we expect AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales will rise 5% to 10% in yen terms. "In the United States, total new annualized premium sales increased 8.8% to $256 million, which was below our targeted annual rate of growth. We are in the process of making several changes to our sales organization, which will likely be a bit disruptive in the short run. However, these changes should enable us to extend our record of strong sales growth in future periods. As a result, we look for total new annualized premium sales to be up 10% to 15% for the year, rather than the 15% increase we previously expected. Yet our view of the U.S. market has not changed, nor has our belief that we can continue to maintain our leading market position. We view the U.S. market for supplemental health insurance products as vast and underpenetrated. And with our increasingly strong U.S. brand, growing distribution system and broadening product line, we believe AFLAC U.S. can capitalize on the market opportunities we see for the future. "Our goal for 2003 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15% to 17% excluding the impact of the yen. Within that range, we had targeted $1.80 per share, or a 15.4% increase over 2002. Even though the year has just begun, we are confident that we will achieve or exceed that earnings target. Beyond 2003, we expect our strong earnings growth to continue. Our objective for 2004 is to also increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe our financial objectives are reasonable and achievable, and that they reflect our attractive position in the U.S. and Japanese insurance markets."

We are also pleased with the financial performance of our U.S. insurance business. Even though the growth of AFLAC U.S. sales slowed from its rapid pace of the last few years, we remain excited about the outlook for future sales growth. At the same time, we remain confident about the underlying strength of our operations. We are especially excited that operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation significantly exceeded our 15% growth target for the year.
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
     The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate for the first quarter enhanced the growth rates of our financial results. However, we believe the best measure of AFLAC's performance is to evaluate our results before the effect of the yen because currency changes are outside of our control. The chart on page four compares selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of the yen.      Benefiting from the stronger yen, total revenues were up 18.4% to $2.8 billion. Net earnings for the first quarter were $237 million, or $.45 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $183 million, or $.34 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2003 included realized investment losses of $7 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2002 also included a loss of $4 million, or $.01 per diluted share from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. The impact of SFAS 133 in the first quarter of 2003 was insignificant.      In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Operating earnings presented in this report exclude the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133.      Operating earnings were a record $244 million, compared with $192 million in the first quarter of 2002. Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 27.8% to $.46, compared with $.36 per share in the first quarter of 2002. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per share by $.02 during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 22.2%, which was significantly better than our annual objective for earnings growth in 2003. Operating return on average shareholders' equity was an impressive 24.0% for the quarter.      During the first quarter, we acquired 1.7 million shares of AFLAC stock. As of March 31, 2003, we had approximately 15 million shares available for purchase under the current repurchase authorization from the board of directors.
 
AFLAC JAPAN
     AFLAC Japan produced solid sales and financial results in the first quarter despite a continued weak economic environment. Premium income in yen increased 6.5%. Net investment income rose 2.0% as reported in yen. Investment income growth in yen terms was held down by the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate for the quarter because approximately 28% of AFLAC Japan's investment income is derived from dollar-denominated investments. Total revenues were up 6.1%. Due to the continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 12.5% to 13.6%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 15.8%.      The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2003 was 118.93, compared with an average rate of 132.69 in the first quarter of 2002. This 11.6% strengthening of the average exchange rate during the quarter magnified the growth rates of AFLAC Japan as reported in dollars.      Reflecting the stronger yen, first quarter premium income in dollars advanced 18.6% to $1.7 billion. Net investment income increased 13.7% to $341 million. Total revenues were up 18.2% to $2.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 29.2% to $285 million.      Investment yields in Japan declined to historic levels during the first quarter. For example, the yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds was 1.12% at the end of March, compared with 1.53% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2002. By focusing on selected debt investments, we purchased yen-denominated securities at an average yield of 3.88% in the quarter. Including dollar-denominated securities, our blended new money yield was 4.13% for the quarter. As of April 18, 2003, we had invested, or committed to invest, approximately 42% of our expected 2003 cash flow at an average yield of 4.12%.      Following an impressive improvement in sales last year, AFLAC Japan again produced strong sales results in the first quarter of 2003. Total new annualized premium sales rose 12.1% to 27.0 billion yen, or $227 million, which was significantly ahead of our expectations. Our sales results benefited from the continued strong demand for medical-related products. We believe medical sales have increased in part due to increased copayments in Japan's national health care system. Reflecting the changing health care environment, our newest product, a stand-alone supplemental medical policy called EVER, sold especially well. During the quarter, we sold more than 160,000 EVER policies. Stand-alone medical insurance represented 25% of total new annualized premium sales. In addition, we continued to experience solid contributions from Rider MAX sales and conversions to the new whole life version of Rider MAX. As expected, sales of cancer life insurance were lower in the quarter, reflecting ou r current marketing focus on medical products as well as a smaller sales contribution from Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co. For the full year, we believe AFLAC Japan's sales will rise 5% to 10% in yen terms.
 
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. generated more than $256 million in total new annualized premium sales for the quarter, although the growth rate slowed from the incredible pace of the last three years. At the same time, premium income remained strong, rising 19.0% to $624 million. Net investment income increased 9.9% to $88 million. Total revenues were up 17.8% to $714 million. Pretax operating earnings advanced 15.5% to $107 million.      Total new annualized premium sales increased 8.8% for the quarter. Accident/disability remained the principal contributor to new sales, accounting for approximately 51% of first quarter sales. Consistent with our product broadening strategy, we are currently introducing a new version of our popular accident plan. And later in the year, we will launch a new cancer expense policy. Although first-quarter sales results were lower than we would have liked, we were encouraged that several of our top producing states posted sales increases of 15% to 20%. Other states, particularly those in which we have split our state operations, generated lower results, which is not uncommon in the short run following the division of a state territory. We have also been increasing the number of regional and district sales coordinators to enhance our recruiting and training capabilities.      We are also increasing the number of AFLAC U.S. marketing territories from five to seven effective May 3, 2003. Increasing the number of territories should enable us to better manage the large and diverse U.S. marketplace. We believe the changes to our sales organization, along with the enhancements to our product line, will benefit sales in future quarters. Based on our first quarter sales results and the actions we are taking to extend our record of strong sales growth, we expect AFLAC U.S. sales will be up 10% to 15% for the year, rather than the 15% increase we previously expected. Yet we view this modest slowdown as just a temporary disruption to the significant growth opportunities we see in the U.S. insurance market.      During the first quarter, we launched two new commercials featuring the popular AFLAC duck. The appeal of the AFLAC duck and its effectiveness as a branding vehicle have resulted in greater consumer awareness of AFLAC than ever before. Independent research reveals that brand recognition of ALFAC stands at approximately 89%, which compares to only 44% in 2000. Our strong brand has clearly benefited the growth of sales and distribution. Recruiting of new sales associates rose 5.5% in the first quarter, despite very difficult comparisons to the first quarter of 2002, during which the number of newly recruited sales associates surged more than 36%. At the end of the first quarter, AFLAC U.S. was represented by more than 55,300 licensed sales associates. The number of sales associates producing business for us on a monthly average basis rose 12.4% to 17,200. We will continue to focus on sales force expansion to help us further penetrate the vast U.S. market.
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.07 per share is payable on June 2, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 15, 2003.
OUTLOOK
     Overall, we are pleased with AFLAC's position in the Japanese and U.S. insurance markets and our results for the first three months of the year. In Japan, we believe the aging population will lead to continued demand for the kind of affordable insurance products that AFLAC offers. Our view of the U.S. market has not changed, nor has our belief that we can continue to maintain our leading market position. We believe the U.S. market for supplemental health insurance products is vast and underpenetrated. And with our increasingly strong U.S. brand, growing distribution system and broadening product line, we believe AFLAC U.S. can capitalize on the market opportunities we see in the future.
     Our goal for 2003 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15% to 17% excluding the impact of the yen. Within that range, we had targeted $1.80 per share, or a 15.4% increase over 2002. Even though the year has just begun, we are confident that we will achieve or exceed that earnings target. Beyond 2003, we expect our strong earnings growth to continue. Our objective for 2004 is to also increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe our financial objectives are reasonable and achievable, and that they reflect our attractive position in the U.S. and Japanese insurance markets.

     99 - Press release of AFLAC Incorporated dated July 23, 2003.
 
 

 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia  July 23, 2003  AFLAC Incorporated today reported its second quarter results. Total revenues, which reflected a stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate, were $2.9 billion in the second quarter, or 13.9% higher than a year ago. Net earnings were $248 million, or $.48 per diluted share, compared with $212 million, or $.40 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2003 included a gain of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. In the second quarter of 2002, net earnings also benefited by $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133. Realized investment losses were $.01 per diluted share in both the current and year ago quarters.
In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Our definition of operating earnings, as presented in this press release, excludes the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133.
Operating earnings were $240 million, compared with $202 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 21.1% to $.46 per diluted share, compared with $.38 per share in the second quarter of 2002. Excluding the benefit of $.02 per share from the stronger yen to the dollar, operating earnings per share increased 15.8% for the quarter.
For the six months of 2003, total revenues rose 16.1% to $5.7 billion. Net earnings were $486 million, or $.93 per diluted share, compared with $395 million, or $.75 per share, for the first six months of 2002. Operating earnings for the six months were $483 million, or $.92 per diluted share, compared with $394 million, or $.74 per share, in 2002.
For the second time in 2003, the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend. The board raised the quarterly dividend from $.07 to $.08 per share, an increase of 14.3%. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend 16.7% in the first quarter of 2003. As a result, the third quarter dividend will be 33.3% higher than the 2002 third quarter dividend. The third quarter dividend is payable on September 2, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 14, 2003.
Commenting on the company's second quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, our results for the first half of 2003 have been rewarding. Although U.S. sales grew at a single-digit pace, we balance those results against very strong sales growth at AFLAC Japan.
 
"AFLAC Japan produced significantly better-than-expected total new annualized premium sales in the second quarter. In fact, second quarter sales were the best in the company's history, rising 11.3% to 33.0 billion yen, or $278 million. These record sales results reflect the continued popularity of our medical-related products. Our new stand-alone medical policy and medical rider to our cancer life policy combined for more than 56% of total new sales in the quarter. We believe Japanese consumers will continue to prefer affordable insurance products that provide living benefits offered by companies with strong balance sheets. We further believe AFLAC fits that description better than any other insurer in Japan. As such, we now believe we are well positioned to increase AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales by 7% to 10% in yen terms for the year.
"In the United States, total new annualized premium sales increased 4.0% to $264 million in the second quarter. As stated in our first quarter earnings announcement, we have made several changes to our sales management infrastructure, which should enhance our recruiting and training capabilities and better position us for renewed sales momentum. For the third quarter, we believe sales will likely increase in the 6% to 13% range. And if third quarter sales are at the high end of that range, then increasing sales by 10% to 15% for the year is a reasonable expectation. In the longer term, we continue to believe that we can capitalize on the vast market opportunities for supplemental health insurance products in the United States.
"Most importantly, we believe we are very well positioned for strong earnings growth in 2003. In May 2001, we established a 2003 objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15% to 17% excluding the impact of the yen. Within that range, we set a specific target earlier this year of earning $1.80 per diluted share in 2003, or a 15.4% increase over 2002. With half of the year complete, we now expect to generate operating earnings per share growth at the high end of the 15% to 17% range. Beyond 2003, we expect our strong earnings growth to continue. Our objective for 2004 and 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe those earnings objectives reflect the many opportunities we see for continued growth in the United States and Japan."

     99  Second Quarter Report to Shareholders of AFLAC Incorporated dated July 23, 2003.

 
 
 
 
 
 
HIGHLIGHTS
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     We are very gratified with AFLAC's performance for the second quarter and first half of 2003. AFLAC Japan again produced better-than-expected sales and financial results. Although sales in the United States grew at a single-digit rate, AFLAC U.S. posted solid financial results in the quarter. Our overall operating results and financial performance were in line with expectations. At the same time, we were especially pleased that we achieved our primary financial objective by increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15.8% for the quarter before the effect of currency translation.
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
     The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate enhanced the growth rates of our financial results in the second quarter, just as it did for the first three months of the year. However, we believe the best measure of AFLAC's performance is to evaluate our results before the effect of the yen because currency changes are outside of our control. The chart on page four compares selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes.
     Reflecting the stronger yen, total revenues were up 13.9% to $2.9 billion. Net earnings for the second quarter were $248 million, or $.48 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $212 million, or $.40 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2003 included realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the quarter also included a gain of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. The impact of SFAS 133 in the second quarter of 2002 was also a gain of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share.
     In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Operating earnings presented in this report exclude the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133.
     Operating earnings were $240 million, compared with $202 million in the second quarter of 2002. Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 21.1% to $.46, compared with $.38 per share in the second quarter of 2002. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per share by $.02 during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 15.8%, which was in line with our objective for earnings growth in 2003. Operating return on average shareholders' equity was 22.7% for the quarter.
     During the second quarter, we acquired 2.8 million shares of AFLAC stock. At the end of June 2003, we had approximately 13 million shares available for purchase under current repurchase authorization from the board of directors.
 
SIX MONTH RESULTS
     For the first half of 2003, total revenues grew 16.1% to $5.7 billion. Net earnings for the six months were $486 million, or $.93 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $395 million, or $.75 per share, a year ago. Net earnings for the six months included realized investment losses of $10 million, or $.02 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $8 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings for the first half also included a gain of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133, compared with a gain of $9 million, or $.02 per share for the first six months of 2002.
     Operating earnings for the six months were $483 million, or $.92 per diluted share, compared with $394 million, or $.74 per share in 2002. Excluding the $.04 per share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.9%.
AFLAC JAPAN
     AFLAC Japan produced strong sales and financial results in the quarter. Premium income in yen increased 6.4%. Net investment income was up 3.4%. Investment income growth in yen terms was restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 29% of AFLAC Japan's investment income is derived from dollar-denominated investments. Total revenues rose 6.0%. Due to the improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 12.5% to 13.3%, which resulted in a 12.4% increase in pretax operating earnings. For the six months in yen, premium income increased 6.4%, while net investment income rose 2.7%. Total revenues were up 6.0% and pretax operating earnings grew 14.1%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 118.49 in the second quarter was 7.2% stronger than the average rate of 127.04 in the second quarter of 2002. For the six months, the average exchange rate was 118.71, or 9.3% stronger than the rate of 129.77 a year ago. The strengthening of the yen for the quarter and the first half of the year magnified the growth rates of AFLAC Japan as reported in dollars.
     Benefiting from the stronger yen, second-quarter premium income in dollars rose 14.0% to $1.8 billion. Net investment income increased 10.8% to $348 million. Total revenues were up 13.6% to $2.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings climbed 20.5% to $282 million. For the six months, premium income rose 16.2% to $3.5 billion. Net investment income was up 12.2% to $689 million. Total revenues increased 15.8% to $4.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $567 million, or 24.8% higher than a year ago.
     Investment yields in Japan declined sharply in the second quarter. However, by the end of June yields had risen substantially, although they still remained at relatively low levels. During the second quarter, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 3.51%. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 3.86%. As of July 21, 2003, we had invested, or committed to invest, approximately 70% of our estimated 2003 cash flow at an average yield of 4.06%.
     AFLAC Japan's sales momentum continued with another quarter of better-than-expected total new annualized premium sales. Total new annualized premium sales rose 11.3% to 33.0 billion yen, or $278 million, in the second quarter. These sales results were the best in AFLAC Japan's history. For the first half of 2003, new sales increased 11.7% to 60.0 billion yen, or $506 million. Our sales results continued to benefit from our popular medical-related products. Rider MAX sold well despite difficult comparisons to last year and was the number one contributor to total new sales in the quarter. And sales of our new stand-alone medical policy, EVER, were 57% above last year's second quarter. With Japan's aging population and continued financial stress on the country's national health care system, we expect demand for our affordable cancer life and medical products to remain strong. We now believe that AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales will increase 7% to 10% in yen terms for the full year.
 
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. posted strong financial results in the second quarter despite slower new sales growth. Premium income rose 17.2% to $637 million. Net investment income was up 7.1% to $87 million. Total revenues increased 15.9% to $727 million, while pretax operating earnings rose 6.2% to $104 million. For the six months, premium income advanced 18.1% to $1.3 billion, and net investment income rose 8.5% to $175 million. Total revenues increased 16.8% to $1.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings were up 10.7% to $211 million.
     As expected, AFLAC U.S. produced a single-digit increase in total new annualized premium sales for the quarter. Total new annualized premium sales rose 4.0% to $264 million in the second quarter. For the six months, new sales were up 6.3% to $521 million. We again experienced very strong sales results in several of our top producing states. Other states, particularly those where we have been aggressively expanding our sales coordinator base, lagged during the quarter. We believe the changes we have made to our sales infrastructure will benefit our organization as the year progresses. However, it will take time for these changes to take hold. For the third quarter, we believe sales will likely increase in the 6% to 13% range. And if third quarter sales are at the high end of that range, then increasing sales by 10% to 15% for the year is a reasonable expectation.
     Although we faced very difficult comparisons to last year's second quarter, recruiting of new sales associates was up 2% for the second quarter and 4% for the six months. At the end of the second quarter, more than 57,100 licensed sales associates represented AFLAC in the United States. And the number of sales associates producing business for us on a monthly average basis rose 10.0% to 17,000 in the quarter. As we expand the number of sales coordinators, we should see continued growth of our sales force. That in turn should help us improve our sales growth and strengthen our leading position in the market for supplemental insurance products in the vast U.S. marketplace.
DIVIDEND
     For the second time this year, the board of directors has approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend. The board increased the quarterly dividend 14.3% from $.07 to $.08 per share. The board had previously increased the quarterly dividend 16.7% in the first quarter of 2003. As a result, the third quarter dividend payment will be 33.3% higher than the dividend we paid in the third quarter of 2002. The third quarter dividend is payable on September 2, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 14, 2003.
OUTLOOK
     Overall, our results for the first half of 2003 have been rewarding. With the exception of U.S. sales growth, we are pleased with AFLAC's operating performance so far this year. Most importantly, we believe we are very well positioned for strong earnings growth in 2003. In May 2001, we established a 2003 objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15% to 17% excluding the impact of the yen. Within that range, we set a specific target earlier this year of earning $1.80 per diluted share in 2003, or a 15.4% increase over 2002. With half of the year complete, we now expect to generate operating earnings per share growth at the high end of the 15% to 17% range. Beyond 2003, we expect our strong earnings growth to continue. Our objective for 2004 and 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe those earnings objectives reflect the many opportunities we see for continued growth in the United States and Japan.
 
     As we look ahead, our principal challenge in the United States is to regain sales momentum. In Japan we continue to operate in a difficult economy accompanied by low interest rates. Yet we believe we can overcome those challenges and achieve our stated earnings objectives in the coming years. The United States is a vast and underserved market for supplemental health insurance products. In Japan we believe our strong balance sheet and affordable insurance products will continue to be attractive to consumers. And we believe we have competitive strengths that will enable us to tap into the potential of the U.S. and Japanese markets.

          99 - Press release of AFLAC Incorporated dated September 29, 2003.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia - September 29, 2003 - AFLAC Incorporated today announced that new annualized premium sales in the United States continued to be sluggish in the third quarter. Based on preliminary sales data, the company estimates that third-quarter new annualized premium sales at AFLAC U.S. will be little changed from the third quarter of 2002. The targeted rate of third-quarter sales growth for AFLAC U.S. was 6% to 13%. New annualized premium sales in Japan remained extremely strong and significantly exceeded expectations in the third quarter. The company estimates that AFLAC Japan's new annualized premium sales in yen will increase by more than 15%, which is substantially better than the company's previous guidance of single-digit growth for third quarter sales. The company also announced that it has split the job responsibilities of the AFLAC U.S. Director of Sales and Marketing into two separate job functions. Effective immediately, Bradley S. Jones assumes the position of Senior Vice President; Director of Sales for AFLAC U.S. Prior to his promotion, Mr. Jones was Vice President of the Northeast Territory for AFLAC, a position he had held since 2000. Joseph P. Kuechenmeister retains the position of Senior Vice President; Director of Marketing. Commenting on the management change, Mr. Kuechenmeister said, "I am pleased to announce Brad's promotion to the newly created position of Director of Sales. Brad has been very successful and effective at every level of sales management during his lengthy career with AFLAC. There is no doubt that our sales force of more than 57,000 licensed associates will benefit from his sales leadership. The Northeast Territory has led AFLAC U.S. with sales growth of nearly 20% this year. We expect Brad to replicate his success th roughout the United States. I look forward to working with him in his new capacity and believe Brad will be a significant contributor to our efforts at enhancing U.S. sales growth." AFLAC Incorporated expects to report third quarter operating earnings of $.46 per diluted share. That represents a 15% increase over the third quarter of 2002, which is in line with the company's expectations for the quarter. The company is scheduled to report third quarter results after the market closes on October 22. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "I am obviously disappointed that AFLAC's U.S. sales growth remained weak and that we did not see the improvement in sales that our marketing territory directors had expected. As was the case in the second quarter, no new issues emerged that have caused us to rethink our approach to the market. Instead, we believe the sales management changes we implemented earlier in the year are simply taking more time than we initially anticipated to generate the desired results. Based on our third quarter sales results, I believe U.S. sales will likely be flat again in the fourth quarter, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. However, we remain convinced that our efforts at expanding AFLAC's sales coordinator base to improve our recruiting and training will lead to better sales growth in the future. And with several states still producing strong sales growth, we continue to view the United States as a vast market that is well suited to our products. "Balancing our disappointment with U.S. sales growth is the exceptionally strong sales growth we have produced in Japan, our largest market. Sales of a number of our products again did better than our expectations. In particular, our stand-alone medical product, EVER, continues to be well received by consumers and agents alike. We believe the aging of Japan's population and the financial strain on the national health care system will continue to strengthen the need for our products. The growing demand for our products is supported by the fact that AFLAC is now the largest life insurance company in Japan in terms of individual policies in force. We believe our undisputed financial strength, quality product line, extensive distribution, superior brand and unmatched operating efficiency will enable us to continue to lead our market sector and achieve our sales and financial targets in Japan. "Most importantly," Amos continued, "we remain confident that we will achieve our target this year of increasing operating earnings per diluted share by 17%, excluding the impact of the yen. And based on the continued strength of our operations in Japan, where we derive approximately 75% of our earnings, we are raising our objective for 2004. We now believe we will increase operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation by 17% in 2004, compared with our previous target of a 15% increase. We have also retained our objective of 15% operating earnings per diluted share growth before currency translation in 2005." AFLAC Incorporated (NYSE - AFL) is an international holding company. A company, AFLAC insures more than 40 million people worldwide. It is a leading writer of insurance products marketed at the worksite in the United States, offering policies to employees at more than 271,200 payroll accounts.

EXHIBITS FILED WITH CURRENT FORM 8-K:
          99 - Press release of AFLAC Incorporated dated October 22, 2003.
 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia - October 22, 2003 -- AFLAC Incorporated today reported its third quarter results. Total revenues were $2.9 billion in the third quarter, or 8.3% higher than a year ago. Net earnings were $237 million, or $.45 per diluted share, compared with $240 million, or $.45 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2003 included realized investment losses of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the quarter also included a loss of $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. The impact of SFAS 133 in the third quarter of 2002 was a gain of $33 million, or $.06 per diluted share.
In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Our definition of operating earnings, as presented in this press release, excludes the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133. The fluctuations in these items are driven by external economic factors that may not reflect the results of our underlying business. Therefore, we believe operating earnings is a useful financial measure because it focuses on the performance of the business and excludes items that are inherently unpredictable.
Third quarter operating earnings were a record $245 million, compared with $210 million a year ago. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 17.5% to $.47, compared with $.40 per share in the third quarter of 2002. Translating yen into dollars did not impact the growth rate of operating earnings per diluted share for the quarter.
For the first nine months of 2003, total revenues rose 13.3% to $8.6 billion, reflecting the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate for the period. Net earnings were $723 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared with $635 million, or $1.20 per share, for the first nine months of 2002. Operating earnings for the nine months were $728 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared with $604 million, or $1.14 per share, in 2002. Excluding the benefit of $.04 per share from the stronger yen to the dollar for the first nine months of the year, operating earnings per share increased 18.4%.
The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend of $.08 per share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 13, 2003.
Commenting on the company's third quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, we are quite pleased with AFLAC's financial performance in 2003, although we are disappointed with the slower sales growth for AFLAC U.S. this year. Total new annualized premium sales rose 1.0% for the third quarter to $263 million, and as we announced in late September, we expect fourth quarter U.S. sales to be flat, compared with sales in the fourth quarter of 2002. However, we are convinced that the United States is a huge and underpenetrated market for our supplemental health insurance products. And we are equally confident that the actions we have taken to enhance our sales force management will ultimately prove effective. As a result, we believe it's just a matter of time before our U.S. sales growth rates improve.
"AFLAC Japan on the other hand has produced very strong financial and sales results throughout 2003, which has compensated for our U.S. sales performance. AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales rose 15.9% in the third quarter to 29.5 billion yen, or $251 million. These strong sales results reflected the continued popularity of our new medical policy, EVER, as well as solid contributions from many other products. Due to tough comparisons to last year, we expect sales to increase 5% to 10% in yen terms for the fourth quarter. However, that would result in an 11% to 12% increase in total new annualized premium sales for the full year, which is well ahead of our initial sales goal of 5% to 10% for 2003.
"Most importantly, we believe we are very well positioned for continued strong earnings growth. We expect to increase operating earnings per share by 17% in 2003, excluding the impact of the yen. Last month we increased our 2004 objective from a 15% increase to 17% growth in operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation. And our objective for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Those objectives reflect the confidence we have in our business model and the significant opportunities we see for continued growth in the United States and Japan. There is no disputing that the United States and Japan are the largest insurance markets in the world. We believe those markets are perfectly suited for AFLAC's insurance products. And we further believe we are well positioned to tap into that vast potential."

          99 - Third Quarter Report to Shareholders of AFLAC Incorporated dated October 22, 2003.
 

HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per diluted share increased 17.5% for the third quarter excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. (The impact of foreign currency translation on operating earnings per share growth was immaterial in the third quarter.)
The operating return on average shareholders' equity was 21.9% for the quarter.
We purchased 2.2 million of AFLAC's shares in the third quarter.
We increased our 2004 target from 15% to 17% growth in operating earnings per share excluding currency translation.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     We remain very pleased with AFLAC's financial performance through September 2003. AFLAC Japan extended its sales momentum, and once again produced better-than-expected sales and financial results. Although AFLAC U.S. sales were below our expectations, its financial results were in line with our targets. Our consolidated operating and financial results remained strong, and we exceeded our target for operating earnings per share growth in the quarter. Based on our year-to-date results, we are very confident that we will increase operating earnings per diluted share by 17% for the full year, before the effect of currency translation.
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
     The yen strengthened sharply in relation to the dollar in late September. However, the average yen/dollar exchange rate for the third quarter was just slightly stronger than a year ago. As a result, our reported financial results in the third quarter benefited only modestly from the translation of yen into dollars. Regardless of the yen's value, we believe the best measure of AFLAC's performance is to evaluate our results before the effect of the yen because currency changes are outside of our control. The chart on page four compares selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes.      Total revenues rose 8.3% to $2.9 billion in the third quarter. Net earnings for the third quarter were $237 million, or $.45 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $240 million, or $.45 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2003 included realized investment losses of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the quarter also included a loss of $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. The impact of SFAS 133 in the third quarter of 2002 was a gain of $33 million, or $.06 per diluted share.      In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Operating earnings presented in this report exclude the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133. The fluctuations in these items are driven by external economic factors that may not reflect the results of our underlying business. Therefore, we believe operating earnings is a useful financial measure because it focuses on the performance of the business and excludes items that are inherently unpredictable.      Third quarter operating earnings were a record $245 million, compared with $210 million in the third quarter of 2002. Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 17.5% to $.47, compared with $.40 per share in the third quarter of 2002. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate did not impact earnings on a per-share basis during the third quarter. Operating return on average shareholders' equity was 21.9% for the quarter.
     During the third quarter, we acquired 2.2 million shares of AFLAC stock. At the end of September 2003, we had approximately 10 million shares available for purchase under the current repurchase authorization from the board of directors.
NINE MONTHS RESULTS
     For the nine months of 2003, total revenues benefited from a stronger yen and rose 13.3% to $8.6 billion. Net earnings for the nine months were $723 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared with $635 million, or $1.20 per share, a year ago. Net earnings for the nine months included realized investment losses of $16 million, or $.03 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $11 million, or $.02 per share, a year ago. Net earnings for the nine months of 2003 also included a gain of $11 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133, compared with a gain of $42 million, or $.08 per share for the same period in 2002.      Operating earnings for the nine months were $728 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared with $604 million, or $1.14 per share in 2002. Excluding the $.04 per share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.4%.
AFLAC JAPAN
     AFLAC Japan continued to generate strong sales and financial results. Premium income in yen rose 6.3% in the third quarter. Net investment income increased 5.7%. Investment income growth has been somewhat suppressed in yen terms this year by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because AFLAC Japan derives approximately 29% of its investment income from dollar-denominated investments. Total revenues were up 6.5%. Due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 12.0% to 12.7%. As a result, pretax operating earnings advanced 12.8%. For the nine months in yen, premium income increased 6.4%, and net investment income was up 3.7%. Total revenues rose 6.2% and pretax operating earnings grew 13.7%.      The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 117.76 in the third quarter was 1.3% stronger than the average rate of 119.24 in the third quarter of 2002. For the nine months, the average exchange rate was 118.39, or 6.5% stronger than the rate of 126.03 a year ago. The stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates enhanced AFLAC Japan's growth rates as reported in dollars, in particular for the first nine months of the year.      Premium income in dollars increased 7.8% in the third quarter to $1.8 billion. Net investment income rose 7.1% to $355 million. Total revenues were up 8.0% to $2.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings surged 14.1% to $276 million. For the nine months, premium income rose 13.2% to $5.3 billion. Net investment income was up 10.4% to $1.0 billion. Total revenues increased 13.0% to $6.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $843 million, an increase of 21.0% over a year ago.      Following a sharp increase in June, investment yields continued to improve in the third quarter. For example, the yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 1.69% in the third quarter, compared with .95% in the second quarter. By comparison, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.99% during the third quarter. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 3.96%.
     AFLAC Japan produced another quarter of better-than-expected total new annualized premium sales. Total new annualized premium sales rose 15.9% to 29.5 billion yen, or $251 million, in the third quarter. For the nine months, new sales increased 13.0% to 89.5 billion yen, or $756 million. These strong sales results reflected the continued popularity of our new medical policy, EVER. Sales of stand-alone medical plans were up 71.1%, compared with the third quarter of 2002, and represented 31% of total new sales in the quarter. At the same time, sales from many of our other products also exceeded our expectations. Due to tough comparisons to last year, we expect sales to increase 5% to 10% in yen terms for the fourth quarter. However, that would result in an 11% to 12% increase in total new annualized premium sales for the full year, which is well ahead of our initial sales goal of 5% to 10% for 2003.
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. posted solid financial results in the third quarter even though total new annualized premium sales did not meet our expectations. Premium income increased 16.3% to $660 million. Net investment income was up 9.4% to $92 million. Total revenues rose 15.3% to $755 million, and pretax operating earnings increased 16.5% to $117 million. For the nine months, premium income was up 17.5% to $1.9 billion, while net investment income rose 8.8% to $267 million. Total revenues increased 16.3% to $2.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $327 million, or 12.7% higher than a year ago.      As we announced in late September, growth in total new annualized premium sales remained sluggish in the third quarter, compared with the third quarter of 2002. Total new sales increased 1.0% to $263 million in the third quarter. For the nine months, new sales were up 4.5% to $783 million. As was the case in the second quarter, no new issues emerged that have caused us to rethink our approach to the market. Instead, we believe the changes we made to help us better execute our model are simply taking longer than we anticipated. We believe it's likely that U.S. sales will also be flat in the fourth quarter, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. However, we remain convinced that our efforts at expanding AFLAC's sales coordinator base to improve our recruiting and training will lead to better sales growth in the future. With several states still producing strong sales growth, we are confident in our overall business model and continue to view the United States as a vast m arket that is well suited to our products.
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors has declared the fourth quarter cash dividend of $.08 per share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 13, 2003.
OUTLOOK
     Overall, we are quite pleased with AFLAC's financial performance in 2003. Although we are disappointed with the slower sales growth for AFLAC U.S. this year, we are convinced the United States is a huge and underpenetrated market for supplemental health insurance products. And we are equally confident that the actions we have taken to enhance our sales force management will ultimately prove effective. As a result, we believe it's just a matter of time before our rates of U.S. sales growth improve. At the same time, AFLAC Japan has produced very strong financial and sales results throughout 2003, which has compensated for our U.S. sales performance.
     Most importantly, we believe we are very well positioned for continued strong earnings growth. We expect to increase operating earnings per share by 17% in 2003, excluding the impact of the yen. Last month we increased our 2004 objective from a 15% increase to 17% growth in operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation. And our objective for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Those objectives reflect the confidence we have in our business model and the significant opportunities we see for continued growth in the United States and Japan. There is no disputing that the United States and Japan are the largest insurance markets in the world. We believe those markets are perfectly suited for AFLAC's insurance products. And we further believe we are well positioned to tap into that vast potential.

EXHIBIT 99.2
HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per diluted share increased 17.5% for the third quarter excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. (The impact of foreign currency translation on operating earnings per share growth was immaterial in the third quarter.)
The operating return on average shareholders' equity was 22.4% for the quarter.
We purchased 2.2 million of AFLAC's shares in the third quarter.
We increased our 2004 target from 15% to 17% growth in operating earnings per share excluding currency translation.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     We remain very pleased with AFLAC's financial performance through September 2003. AFLAC Japan extended its sales momentum, and once again produced better-than-expected sales and financial results. Although AFLAC U.S. sales were below our expectations, its financial results were in line with our targets. Our consolidated operating and financial results remained strong, and we exceeded our target for operating earnings per share growth in the quarter. Based on our year-to-date results, we are very confident that we will increase operating earnings per diluted share by 17% for the full year, before the effect of currency translation.
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
     The yen strengthened sharply in relation to the dollar in late September. However, the average yen/dollar exchange rate for the third quarter was just slightly stronger than a year ago. As a result, our reported financial results in the third quarter benefited only modestly from the translation of yen into dollars. Regardless of the yen's value, we believe the best measure of AFLAC's performance is to evaluate our results before the effect of the yen because currency changes are outside of our control. The chart on page four compares selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes.      Total revenues rose 8.3% to $2.9 billion in the third quarter. Net earnings for the third quarter were $237 million, or $.45 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $240 million, or $.45 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2003 included realized investment losses of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the quarter also included a loss of $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. The impact of SFAS 133 in the third quarter of 2002 was a gain of $33 million, or $.06 per diluted share.      In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Operating earnings presented in this report exclude the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133. The fluctuations in these items are driven by external economic factors that may not reflect the results of our underlying business. Therefore, we believe operating earnings is a useful financial measure because it focuses on the performance of the business and excludes items that are inherently unpredictable.      Third quarter operating earnings were a record $245 million, compared with $210 million in the third quarter of 2002. Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 17.5% to $.47, compared with $.40 per share in the third quarter of 2002. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate did not impact earnings on a per-share basis during the third quarter. Operating return on average shareholders' equity was 22.4% for the quarter.
     During the third quarter, we acquired 2.2 million shares of AFLAC stock. At the end of September 2003, we had approximately 10 million shares available for purchase under the current repurchase authorization from the board of directors.
NINE MONTHS RESULTS
     For the nine months of 2003, total revenues benefited from a stronger yen and rose 13.3% to $8.6 billion. Net earnings for the nine months were $723 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared with $635 million, or $1.20 per share, a year ago. Net earnings for the nine months included realized investment losses of $16 million, or $.03 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $11 million, or $.02 per share, a year ago. Net earnings for the nine months of 2003 also included a gain of $11 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133, compared with a gain of $42 million, or $.08 per share for the same period in 2002.      Operating earnings for the nine months were $728 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, compared with $604 million, or $1.14 per share in 2002. Excluding the $.04 per share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.4%.
AFLAC JAPAN
     AFLAC Japan continued to generate strong sales and financial results. Premium income in yen rose 6.3% in the third quarter. Net investment income increased 5.7%. Investment income growth has been somewhat suppressed in yen terms this year by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because AFLAC Japan derives approximately 29% of its investment income from dollar-denominated investments. Total revenues were up 6.5%. Due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 12.0% to 12.7%. As a result, pretax operating earnings advanced 12.8%. For the nine months in yen, premium income increased 6.4%, and net investment income was up 3.7%. Total revenues rose 6.2% and pretax operating earnings grew 13.7%.      The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 117.76 in the third quarter was 1.3% stronger than the average rate of 119.24 in the third quarter of 2002. For the nine months, the average exchange rate was 118.39, or 6.5% stronger than the rate of 126.03 a year ago. The stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates enhanced AFLAC Japan's growth rates as reported in dollars, in particular for the first nine months of the year.      Premium income in dollars increased 7.8% in the third quarter to $1.8 billion. Net investment income rose 7.1% to $355 million. Total revenues were up 8.0% to $2.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings surged 14.1% to $276 million. For the nine months, premium income rose 13.2% to $5.3 billion. Net investment income was up 10.4% to $1.0 billion. Total revenues increased 13.0% to $6.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $843 million, an increase of 21.0% over a year ago.      Following a sharp increase in June, investment yields continued to improve in the third quarter. For example, the yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 1.69% in the third quarter, compared with .95% in the second quarter. By comparison, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.99% during the third quarter. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 3.96%.
     AFLAC Japan produced another quarter of better-than-expected total new annualized premium sales. Total new annualized premium sales rose 15.9% to 29.5 billion yen, or $251 million, in the third quarter. For the nine months, new sales increased 13.0% to 89.5 billion yen, or $756 million. These strong sales results reflected the continued popularity of our new medical policy, EVER. Sales of stand-alone medical plans were up 71.1%, compared with the third quarter of 2002, and represented 31% of total new sales in the quarter. At the same time, sales from many of our other products also exceeded our expectations. Due to tough comparisons to last year, we expect sales to increase 5% to 10% in yen terms for the fourth quarter. However, that would result in an 11% to 12% increase in total new annualized premium sales for the full year, which is well ahead of our initial sales goal of 5% to 10% for 2003.
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. posted solid financial results in the third quarter even though total new annualized premium sales did not meet our expectations. Premium income increased 16.3% to $660 million. Net investment income was up 9.4% to $92 million. Total revenues rose 15.3% to $755 million, and pretax operating earnings increased 16.5% to $117 million. For the nine months, premium income was up 17.5% to $1.9 billion, while net investment income rose 8.8% to $267 million. Total revenues increased 16.3% to $2.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $327 million, or 12.7% higher than a year ago.      As we announced in late September, growth in total new annualized premium sales remained sluggish in the third quarter, compared with the third quarter of 2002. Total new sales increased 1.0% to $263 million in the third quarter. For the nine months, new sales were up 4.5% to $783 million. As was the case in the second quarter, no new issues emerged that have caused us to rethink our approach to the market. Instead, we believe the changes we made to help us better execute our model are simply taking longer than we anticipated. We believe it's likely that U.S. sales will also be flat in the fourth quarter, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. However, we remain convinced that our efforts at expanding AFLAC's sales coordinator base to improve our recruiting and training will lead to better sales growth in the future. With several states still producing strong sales growth, we are confident in our overall business model and continue to view the United States as a vast m arket that is well suited to our products.
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors has declared the fourth quarter cash dividend of $.08 per share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2003, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 13, 2003.
OUTLOOK
     Overall, we are quite pleased with AFLAC's financial performance in 2003. Although we are disappointed with the slower sales growth for AFLAC U.S. this year, we are convinced the United States is a huge and underpenetrated market for supplemental health insurance products. And we are equally confident that the actions we have taken to enhance our sales force management will ultimately prove effective. As a result, we believe it's just a matter of time before our rates of U.S. sales growth improve. At the same time, AFLAC Japan has produced very strong financial and sales results throughout 2003, which has compensated for our U.S. sales performance.
     Most importantly, we believe we are very well positioned for continued strong earnings growth. We expect to increase operating earnings per share by 17% in 2003, excluding the impact of the yen. Last month we increased our 2004 objective from a 15% increase to 17% growth in operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation. And our objective for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Those objectives reflect the confidence we have in our business model and the significant opportunities we see for continued growth in the United States and Japan. There is no disputing that the United States and Japan are the largest insurance markets in the world. We believe those markets are perfectly suited for AFLAC's insurance products. And we further believe we are well positioned to tap into that vast potential.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia - December 10, 2003 -- AFLAC Incorporated announced today that it is evaluating its investment in Parmalat Finanziaria SpA following the dairy company's credit rating downgrade to below-investment-grade status. Standard & Poor's reduced the credit rating of Parmalat from "BBB-" to "B+" on December 9, 2003. The rating agency lowered the rating again today to "CC." AFLAC's investment in Parmalat was $428 million at September 30, 2003. Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer Joseph W. Smith, Jr. said: "Our credit analysts are closely monitoring financial developments at Parmalat. As is always the case with an investment we own that has been downgraded to below investment grade, we are in the process of applying our stated impairment policy to determine what, if any, impairment charge might be warranted in the fourth quarter of this year." AFLAC Incorporated (NYSE - AFL) is an international holding company. A company, AFLAC insures more than 40 million people worldwide. It is a leading writer of insurance products marketed at the worksite in the United States, offering policies to employees at more than 278,900 payroll accounts.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia - December 18, 2003 - AFLAC Incorporated announced today that it has sold its investment in Parmalat Finanziaria SpA. Commenting on the sale, Senior Vice President and Chief Investment Officer Joseph W. Smith, Jr. said: "We closely monitored financial developments at Parmalat over the last week, and concluded that Parmalat no longer met the profile of investments we want to retain in our portfolio. We estimate that the sale of our holdings in Parmalat will reduce net earnings by $257 million, or approximately $.49 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. "We are certainly not pleased to be realizing a loss on this investment. However, this action is consistent with our investment approach. We purchase only investment-grade securities, and in the event that a security is downgraded to below-investment-grade, we undertake a thorough credit review to determine if we will continue to hold the investment. The sale of Parmalat demonstrates that our tolerance for below-investment-grade securities has not increased. We remain focused on a conservative investment approach that we believe is in the best interest of our policyholders and shareholders." In addition to net earnings, the company views operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, as an important indicator of financial performance. We believe the combined presentation and evaluation of operating earnings, together with net earnings, provides information that may enhance an investor's understanding of the company's underlying profitability and results of operations. Our definition of operating earnings, as presented in this press release, excludes the following items on an after-tax basis from net earnings: realized investment gains/losses and the impact from SFAS 133. The fluctuations in these items are driven by external economic factors that may not reflect the results of our underlying business. Therefore, we believe operating earnings is a useful financial measure because it focuses on the performance of the business and excludes items that are inherently unpredictable. President and Chief Financial Officer Kriss Cloninger III, added: "We remain very pleased with the strength of our capital position, especially as it relates to regulatory solvency standards. We believe that when full-year 2003 results are reported, we will again produce a risk-based capital ratio that compares very favorably to our peer group. Furthermore, this strong capital base will permit us to repurchase an amount of AFLAC shares in 2004 that is consistent with our previously stated expectations. "At the same time, we believe we are very well positioned to achieve our earnings objectives. Our goal is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 17% in 2003 and 2004, excluding the impact of the yen. And our 2005 objective is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe those objectives are reasonable and achievable, and reflect the continued need for the products that we offer in Japan and the United States." AFLAC Incorporated (NYSE - AFL) is an international holding company. A company, AFLAC insures more than 40 million people worldwide. It is a leading writer of insurance products marketed at the worksite in the United States, offering policies to employees at more than 278,900 payroll accounts.

ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
ITEM 9.  REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE
     AFLAC Incorporated is providing its press release dated February 2, 2004 in which it reported its fourth quarter results and its Fourth Quarter Report to Shareholders herein as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 for reporting under Items 9 and 12.      Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We evaluate our net earnings, as determined by GAAP, by separating it into four components. The components are 1) operating earnings 2) realized investment gains and losses, which include impairment charges, 3) the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps, and 4) nonrecurring items. Management views each of these components separately. The first component is used by management to evaluate the financial performance of AFLAC's insurance operations. The other three components tend to be driven more by general economic conditions and events and obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in our insurance operations. We believe the reader of our financial statements will find this component breakdown useful for two reasons. First, it enables the reader to view and evaluate the company as management views and evaluates the company. Second, it lays the foundation for a forward-looking discussion by separately identifying items and events, which may or may not be controllable by management.      Operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is the primary component of our net earnings. As a result, our discussion of earnings and earnings comparisons is directed toward operating earnings. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business.      Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We translate AFLAC Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using an end-of-period exchange rate. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting event for AFLAC and not an economic event for our company or shareholders. Because the effect of translating yen into dollars distorts the rate of growth of our insurance operations, we encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.      The second component of net earnings is realized investment gains and losses. Our investment strategy is to invest in fixed-income securities in order to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the company's profitability. We do not purchase securities with the intent of generating capital gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers of debt securities. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of our insurance products, which are the principal drivers of our profitability. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to evaluate our operations excluding realized investment gains and losses.
ITEM 12.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
     The third component of net earnings is the change in fair value of the interest rate component of our cross-currency swaps. We entered into swap agreements in order to effectively convert our dollar-denominated senior debt obligation, which matures in 2009, into a yen-denominated obligation. In looking at the economic impact on AFLAC, the effect of issuing fixed-rate, dollar-denominated debt and swapping it into fixed-rate, yen-denominated debt is identical to issuing fixed-rate yen-denominated debt in a like amount. However, the accounting treatment is different. SFAS No. 133 requires that the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swap be reflected in the income statement. The change in fair value is determined based on relative dollar and yen interest rates and has no cash impact on our results of operations. Additionally, we have the ability to retain the cross-currency swaps until their maturity. At maturity, the swaps' fair value and the original contract value will be equal and the cumulative impact of gains and losses from the changes in fair value of the interest components will be zero. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to evaluate our operations excluding the change in fair value of the interest rate component of our cross-currency swaps.      Nonrecurring items, which is the fourth component of net earnings, includes those items that have not occurred in the last two years and are not likely to occur in the next two years. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to evaluate our operations excluding nonrecurring items.      We believe the display and discussion of these components is essential to the reader's ability to understand and analyze the historical financial performance of our business in order to formulate a view of what the future will hold for the company's overall financial performance as well as each of these components.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia - February 2, 2004 -- AFLAC Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results. Total revenues rose 6.8% to $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, compared with a year ago. Net earnings were $73 million, or $.14 per diluted share, compared with $186 million, or $.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net earnings were significantly influenced by realized investment losses in the quarter of $175 million, or $.34 per diluted share. Realized investment losses were $4 million, or $.01 per share, in the fourth quarter a year ago. The large realized investment losses in the fourth quarter of 2003 related primarily to the sale of our investment in Parmalat. Following disturbing financial developments at Parmalat and several credit ratings downgrades of its debt, we conducted an extensive analysis of our investment. Based on that analysis, we sold all of our holdings in Parmalat and realized a pretax loss of $257 million. Earlier in the quarter, we sold our investment in Levi Strauss at a pretax loss of $38 million. In both cases, we concluded these companies no longer met the profile of investments we want to retain in our portfolio. The investment losses on Parmalat, Levi Strauss and other investment transactions in the normal course of business decreased consolidated pretax earnings by $284 million ($.34 per diluted share after taxes). At the end of the year, only 2.8% of total company debt investments were rated below investment grade, while 68.0% were rated "A" or better. Net earnings in the fourth quarter also included a loss of $14 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. That compares with a loss of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from SFAS 133 in the prior year's quarter. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002 also reflected a charge of $26 million, or $.05 per diluted share, for our estimated portion of a life insurance industry assessment for Japan's policyholder protection fund. For the year, total revenues were $11.4 billion. Net earnings were $795 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared with $821 million, or $1.55 per share, in 2002. Operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is the primary component of our net earnings. As a result, our discussion of earnings and earnings comparisons is directed toward operating earnings. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were a record $262 million, compared with $221 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 19.0% to $.50 per diluted share, compared with $.42 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.02 in the fourth quarter. For the year, operating earnings were $989 million, compared with $825 million a year ago. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 21.2% from $1.56 to $1.89 in 2003. Excluding the $.06 per share benefit from the stronger yen for the full year, operating earnings per diluted share rose 17.3%. That increase was in line with our upwardly revised 2003 target of a 17% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the effect of currency translation. The board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend for the 22nd consecutive year. Effective with the first quarter of 2004, we raised the quarterly cash dividend 18.8%, from $.08 to $.095 per share. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 1, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 13, 2004. The board of directors also authorized the purchase of up to 30 million shares of AFLAC's common stock. This authorization is in addition to the 7.0 million shares that remained under a previous authorization as of December 31, 2003, and brings the total number of shares available for purchase to approximately 37 million. The company anticipates that the repurchase of shares will be conducted from time to time in open market or negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. Commenting on the company's results for the fourth quarter and the year, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are very pleased with the way we concluded 2003. AFLAC Japan produced sales growth that was in line with our expectations for the last three months of the year. AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales rose 8.7% to 31.7 billion yen, or $291 million, in the fourth quarter. For the year, new sales were up 11.9% to 121.2 billion yen, or $1.0 billion. Our annual sales results compared favorably to our initial expectation of 5% to 10% sales growth in 2003. Our objective for 2004 is to increase AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales 5% to 10% in yen terms. "For the year, new sales were up 5.4% to $1.1 billion. Our objective for U.S. sales growth in 2004 is an increase of 10% to 12%. "Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in 2003. Clearly, we experienced disappointment during the year, notably AFLAC U.S. sales growth and the investment loss from Parmalat. Yet as we start 2004, we believe we are positioned to see better U.S. sales growth, and the overall quality of our investment portfolio remains high. At the same time, we had our share of highlights in 2003. We were especially proud of AFLAC Japan's strong sales and financial results. The strength of AFLAC Japan's financial performance was the primary reason for increasing our 2003 earnings target, and then achieving that objective. And we were also pleased with the board of directors' decision to increase the cash dividend twice in 2003. "In looking ahead, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for continued growth. Our objective for 2004 is a 17% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation. And our objective for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We view our earnings targets as realistic and achievable. Furthermore, they reflect our conviction that the U.S. and Japanese markets are perfectly suited to AFLAC's products. And we believe our competitive strengths put us in a strong position to capitalize on those opportunities."AFLAC Incorporated (NYSE - AFL) is an international holding company. A company, AFLAC insures more than 40 million people worldwide. It is a leading writer of insurance products marketed at the worksite in the United States, offering policies to employees at more than 288,100 payroll accounts.

HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per diluted share increased 14.3% for the fourth quarter excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (including the effect of the yen, operating earnings per share were up 19.0%).
AFLAC U.S. total new sales exceeded expectations in the quarter and rose 7.7% to a record $345 million.
AFLAC Japan total new sales increased 8.7% in yen terms, in line with our quarterly target.
We purchased 3.5 million of AFLAC's shares in the fourth quarter.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     We are very pleased with the way we concluded 2003. AFLAC Japan produced sales growth that was in line with our expectations for the last three months of the year. At the same time, its financial performance remained strong. We were also encouraged by an acceleration of AFLAC U.S. sales in the fourth quarter. In fact, AFLAC U.S. finished the year with record quarterly sales, while also producing solid financial results. As a result, our consolidated financial results remained strong and in line with our targets for growth.      Operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is the primary component of our net earnings. As a result, our discussion of earnings and earnings comparisons is directed toward operating earnings. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps, and nonrecurring items. We believe that an analysis of operating earnings is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of our insurance business.
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
     The yen was significantly stronger in relation to the dollar during the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002. The average yen/dollar exchange rate for the full year was also stronger than a year ago. As a result, our reported financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full year benefited from the translation of yen into dollars. The chart on page four compares selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes.      Total revenues rose 6.8% to $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, compared with a year ago. Net earnings were $73 million, or $.14 per diluted share, compared with $186 million, or $.35 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002. Net earnings were significantly influenced by realized investment losses in the quarter of $175 million, or $.34 per diluted share. Realized investment losses were $4 million, or $.01 per share, in the fourth quarter a year ago.      The large realized investment losses in the fourth quarter of 2003 related primarily to the sale of our investment in Parmalat. Following disturbing financial developments at Parmalat and several credit ratings downgrades of its debt, we conducted an extensive analysis of our investment. Based on that analysis, we sold all of our holdings in Parmalat and realized a pretax loss of $257 million. Earlier in the quarter, we sold our investment in Levi Strauss at a pretax loss of $38 million. In both cases, we concluded these companies no longer met the profile of investments we want to retain in our portfolio. The investment losses on Parmalat, Levi Strauss and other investment transactions in the normal course of business decreased consolidated pretax earnings by $284 million ($.34 per diluted share after taxes). At the end of the year, only 2.8% of total company debt investments were rated below investment grade, while 68.0% were rated "A" or better.
 
     Net earnings in the fourth quarter also included a loss of $14 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. That compares with a loss of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from SFAS 133 in the prior year's quarter. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2002 also reflected a charge of $26 million, or $.05 per diluted share, for our estimated portion of a life insurance industry assessment for Japan's policyholder protection fund.      Fourth quarter operating earnings were a record $262 million, compared with $221 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Operating earnings per diluted share increased 19.0% to $.50, compared with $.42 per share a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings by $.02 per share during the fourth quarter.      During the fourth quarter, we acquired 3.5 million shares of AFLAC stock. For the year, we purchased 10.2 million shares. The board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 30 million shares of our common stock. This authorization is in addition to the 7.0 million shares that remained under a previous authorization at year-end 2003, and brings the total number of shares available for purchase to approximately 37 million.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
     Total revenues for the full year also benefited from the stronger yen and rose 11.6% to $11.4 billion. Net earnings were $795 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared with $821 million, or $1.55 per share, in 2002. Net earnings for the year included realized investment losses of $191 million, or $.37 per diluted share, compared with losses of $15 million, or $.03 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in 2003 also included a loss of $3 million from the impact of SFAS 133. Net earnings in 2002 were impacted from a gain of $37 million, or $.07 per share, from the effect of SFAS 133, and the previously mentioned charge for the policyholder protection fund.      Operating earnings for the year were $989 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, compared with $825 million, or $1.56 per share in 2002. Excluding the $.06 per-share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 17.3%. That increase was in line with our upwardly revised 2003 target of a 17% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the effect of currency translation.
AFLAC JAPAN
     Throughout the year, AFLAC Japan produced strong sales and financial results. In the fourth quarter, premium income in yen rose 6.5%. Net investment income increased 1.3%. Investment income growth was suppressed in yen terms by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because AFLAC Japan derives approximately 29% of its investment income from dollar-denominated investments. Total revenues were up 5.7%. Due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 12.1% to 12.6%. As a result, pretax operating earnings rose 9.6%. For the year, premium income increased 6.4% in yen, and net investment income rose 3.1%. Total revenues increased 6.1% and pretax operating earnings advanced 12.6%.
 
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 109.06 in the fourth quarter was 12.4% stronger than the average rate of 122.58 in the fourth quarter of 2002. For the year, the average exchange rate was 115.95, or 7.9% stronger than the rate of 125.15 a year ago. The stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates enhanced AFLAC Japan's growth rates as reported in dollars.      Premium income in dollars increased 19.9% in the fourth quarter to $2.0 billion. Net investment income was up 14.0% to $377 million. Total revenues rose 19.0% to $2.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings surged 23.2% to $297 million. For the year, premium income rose 15.0% to $7.3 billion. Net investment income was $1.4 billion, an increase of 11.3%. Total revenues rose 14.6% to $8.8 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $1.1 billion, up 21.6% over 2002.      Investment yields in Japan improved slightly in the last three months of the year. For example, the yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 1.87% in the fourth quarter, compared with 1.69% in the third quarter. We purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.33% during the fourth quarter. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 2.59%.      AFLAC Japan produced another quarter of solid sales growth. Total new annualized premium sales rose 8.7% to 31.7 billion yen, or $291 million, in the fourth quarter. For the year, new sales were up 11.9% to 121.2 billion yen, or $1.0 billion. Our annual sales results compared favorably to our initial expectation of 5% to 10% sales growth in 2003. Fourth-quarter new sales continued to benefit from EVER, our popular medical policy. In fact, sales of stand-alone medical plans were up 41.9%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2002, and represented 30% of total new sales in the quarter. We believe consumer demand for our stand-alone medical coverage, our flagship cancer life policy, and our other products will continue this year as well. Our objective is to increase total new annualized premium sales 5% to 10% in yen terms during 2004.
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. generated solid financial results and improved sales growth in the fourth quarter. Premium income increased 14.9% to $673 million. Net investment income rose 10.7% to $95 million. Total revenues were up 14.3% to $771 million, and pretax operating earnings increased 10.2% to $123 million. For the year, premium income advanced 16.8% to $2.6 billion, while net investment income rose 9.3% to $362 million. Total revenues increased 15.8% to $3.0 billion. Pretax operating earnings were up 12.0% to $451 million.      After three quarters of disappointing sales results, we were encouraged to see improvement in total new annualized premium sales in the final quarter of the year. Total new sales increased 7.7% in the quarter to $345 million, which exceeded our expectations. In fact, fourth-quarter sales were the best in the company's history. For the year, new sales were up 5.4% to $1.1 billion. The Northeast Territory led AFLAC U.S. throughout the year and produced a tremendous sales increase of more than 21% for the year. Our challenge is to replicate the Northeast Territory's success throughout other AFLAC territories in the United States. As we discussed in prior quarters, we took significant steps to expand and improve our sales management infrastructure in 2003. We believe these steps were necessary to produce longer term, sustainable sales growth.      As we look ahead, our thoughts on AFLAC's business model and the U.S. market have not changed. We believe the United States is an underpenetrated market that is well suited to our products. And we further believe that the ongoing expansion of our sales coordinator base will lead to better recruiting, training and sales results in the future. Our objective for U.S. sales growth in 2004 is an increase of 10% to 12%.
 
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend for the 22nd consecutive year. Effective with the first quarter of 2004, we raised the quarterly cash dividend 18.8%, from $.08 to $.095 per share. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 1, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 13, 2004.
OUTLOOK
     Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in 2003. Clearly, we experienced disappointment during the year, notably AFLAC U.S. sales growth and the investment loss from Parmalat. Yet as we start 2004, we believe we are positioned to see better U.S. sales growth, and the overall quality of our investment portfolio remains high. At the same time, we had our share of highlights in 2003. We were especially proud of AFLAC Japan's strong sales and financial results. The strength of AFLAC Japan's financial performance was the primary reason for increasing our 2003 earnings target and then achieving that objective. And we were also pleased with the board of directors' decision to increase the cash dividend twice in 2003.      In looking ahead, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for continued growth. Our objective for 2004 is a 17% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation. And our objective for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We view our earnings targets as realistic and achievable. Furthermore, they reflect our conviction that the U.S. and Japanese markets are perfectly suited to AFLAC's products. And we believe our competitive strengths put us in a strong position to capitalize on those opportunities. Daniel P. Amos Chairman and Chief Executive Officer February 2, 2004

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia -- April 27, 2004 -- AFLAC Incorporated today reported its first quarter results. Total revenues, which benefited from foreign currency translation, were $3.3 billion in the first quarter, or 16.8% higher than a year ago. Net earnings, which also reflected the stronger yen to the dollar during the quarter, were $315 million, or $.61 per diluted share, compared with $237 million, or $.45 per diluted share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the first quarter of 2004 included realized investment gains of $6 million, or $.01 per share, compared with realized investment losses of $7 million, or $.01 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter also included a gain of $11 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. The impact of SFAS 133 in the first quarter of 2003 was insignificant. And net earnings in the first quarter of 2004 also reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain AFLAC Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of AFLAC's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps as required by SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of AFLAC's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact of SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events and therefore obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in AFLAC's insurance operations.
Operating earnings were a record $295 million, compared with $244 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 23.9% to $.57 per diluted share, compared with $.46 per share in the first quarter of 2003. Excluding the benefit of $.03 per share from the stronger yen to the dollar, operating earnings per share increased 17.4% for the quarter.
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.095 per share is payable on June 1, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 14, 2004.
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, we are very encouraged with our start in 2004. We are especially pleased that operating earnings per share growth before currency translation was in line with our annual target of a 17% increase.
"AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales were in line with our expectations, but slightly below our annual objective. Total new sales rose 4.7% to 28.3 billion yen, or $264 million. Our sales results continued to benefit from the strong demand for our medical product called EVER. Sales from stand-alone medical products rose 34% in the quarter and accounted for 33% of total new sales. Sales growth was impacted in the first quarter by an expected decline in Rider MAX conversions. Excluding conversions, sales were up 7.8% in the first quarter. Sales comparisons to last year were also affected by a lower sales contribution from Dai-ichi Mutual Life. However, sales growth from our traditional sales channels rose 6.2%. We expect sales growth in the second half of the year to benefit from new promotional campaigns and product enhancements, and we believe that a 5% to 10% increase in new sales in yen is a reasonable expectation for the year.
"In the United States, total new annualized premium sales growth continued to improve. Total new annualized premium sales increased 13.8% to $292 million in the first quarter. We believe U.S. sales benefited from last year's expansion and enhancement of our sales management infrastructure, as well as newly implemented training programs. Accident/disability remained the principal contributor to new sales in the quarter, accounting for approximately 52% of first quarter sales. Sales of other products, including cancer expense, hospital indemnity coverage and dental insurance, also rose at a strong pace and were solid contributors to sales in the quarter. For the full year, our objective is a 10% to 12% increase in AFLAC U.S. sales.
"As we look ahead, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities in the United States. The U.S. market is vast and underpenetrated. We believe we can tap into that potential by the continued expansion of our distribution system and broadening of our product line. At the same time, we expect continued solid growth in AFLAC Japan's business. We believe AFLAC's affordable products, which provide consumers with "living" benefits, are perfectly suited to the needs of an aging Japanese population.
"Our goal for 2004 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 17% excluding the impact of the yen. For 2005 our objective is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe these financial objectives are a reasonable reflection of the growth opportunities we see in the two largest insurance markets in the world."

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis increased 17.4% for the first quarter excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (including the effect of the yen, operating earnings per share were up 23.9%).
We purchased 3.2 million of AFLAC's shares in the first quarter.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     We are pleased with our results for the first quarter of 2004 and believe we are off to a good start toward achieving our annual performance targets. AFLAC Japan produced sales and financial results that were in line with our expectations. AFLAC U.S. sales were strong, and its financial performance was also consistent with our operating objectives.
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
     The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter magnified the growth rates of our financial results. Total revenues were up 16.8% to $3.3 billion. Net earnings were $315 million, or $.61 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $237 million, or $.45 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2004 included realized investment gains of $6 million, or $.01 per share, compared with realized investment losses of $7 million, or $.01 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter also included a gain of $11 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. The impact of SFAS 133 in the first quarter of 2003 was insignificant. And net earnings in the first quarter of 2004 also reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain AFLAC Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government.
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of AFLAC's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps as required by SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of AFLAC's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact of SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events and therefore can obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in AFLAC's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating earnings to net earnings appears on page six.
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We translate AFLAC Japan's yen-denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for AFLAC and not an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because the effect of translating yen into dollars distorts the rate of growth of our insurance operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart on page four compares selected income statement items w ith and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of the yen.
     Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2004 were a record $295 million, compared with $244 million in the first quarter of 2003. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 23.9% to $.57, compared with $.46 in the first quarter of 2003. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per share by $.03 during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 17.4%, which was in line with our stated annual objective for operating earnings per share growth in 2004.
     During the first quarter, we acquired 3.2 million shares of AFLAC stock. As of March 31, 2004, we had approximately 34 million shares available for purchase under the current repurchase authorizations from the board of directors.
AFLAC JAPAN
     AFLAC Japan continued to produce solid financial results. Premium income in yen increased 6.4%. Net investment income was down .6% as reported in yen. Investment income growth in yen terms was held down in part by the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 29% of AFLAC Japan's investment income is dollar denominated. Total revenues rose 5.2%. Due in part to the continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 13.6% to 14.3%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen climbed 10.4%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2004 was 107.32, compared with an average rate of 118.93 in the first quarter of 2003. As a result of the 10.8% strengthening of the average exchange rate during the quarter, growth rates of AFLAC Japan as reported in dollars were greater than increases on a yen basis.
     Reflecting the stronger yen, first quarter premium income in dollars advanced 18.0% to $2.1 billion. Net investment income increased 10.2% to $376 million. Total revenues were up 16.6% to $2.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 22.3% to $349 million.
     Investment yields in Japan remained stable for the first three months of 2004, compared with the fourth quarter of 2003. For example, the yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds was unchanged, averaging 1.87% in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. Reflecting a focus on primarily "A" and "AA" rated securities, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.51% during the first quarter. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 2.67%. However, as of April 23, 2004, we had invested, or committed to invest, approximately 64% of our expected 2004 cash flow at an average yield of 3.18%.
     AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales rose 4.7% in the first quarter to 28.3 billion yen, or $264 million. Sales growth was impacted in the first quarter of 2004 by declining Rider MAX conversion activity and lower sales contributions from Dai-ichi Mutual Life, compared with the first quarter of 2003. However, sales of our stand-alone supplemental medical policy, EVER, continued to be very strong. Stand-alone medical sales increased 34% in the quarter, and represented 33% of total new annualized premium sales. We expect sales growth in the second half of the year to benefit from new promotional campaigns and product enhancements, and we believe that a 5% to 10% increase in new sales in yen is a reasonable expectation for the year.
 
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. produced strong sales and financial results in the first quarter. Premium income increased 13.9% to $710 million. Net investment income rose 10.6% to $97 million. Total revenues were up 13.4% to $810 million. Pretax operating earnings were $122 million, an increase of 14.4%.
     The recovery of AFLAC U.S. sales growth that began in the fourth quarter of 2003 has clearly extended into this year. Total new annualized premium sales increased 13.8% to $292 million in the first quarter. We believe U.S. sales benefited from last year's expansion and enhancement of our sales management infrastructure. Accident/disability remained the principal contributor to new sales in the quarter, accounting for approximately 52% of first quarter sales. Sales of other products, including cancer expense, hospital indemnity coverage and dental insurance, also rose at a strong pace and were solid contributors to sales in the quarter. For the full year, our objective is a 10% to 12% increase in AFLAC U.S. sales.
     We remain convinced that our popular commercials continue to be effective at maintaining AFLAC as one of the best-known brands in the insurance industry. Based on independent research, brand recognition of AFLAC is approximately 90%. In 2000, AFLAC's brand recognition was only 44%. AFLAC's brand strength was highlighted in the April 19 issue of magazine, which included us as one of the top companies in brand value in the United States. The success of the AFLAC Duck commercials has benefited our sales and distribution system. Although recruiting of new sales associates declined 8.6% in the first quarter, we still recruited more than 5,800 agents. We also experienced a very solid increase of 16.5% in the number of new producing associates. We believe the new training programs that we implemented in 2003 are helping recently recruited sales associates become more effective. At the end of the first quarter, AFLAC U.S. was represented by 57,700 licensed sales a ssociates, which was 4.2% higher than a year ago.

DIVIDEND
     The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.095 per share is payable on June 1, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 14, 2004.
OUTLOOK
     Overall, we are very encouraged with our start in 2004. As we look ahead, we expect continued solid growth in AFLAC Japan's business. We believe AFLAC's affordable products, which provide consumers with "living" benefits, are perfectly suited to the needs of an aging Japanese population. At the same time, we remain enthusiastic about the opportunities in the United States. The U.S. market is vast and underpenetrated. We believe we can tap into that potential by the continued expansion of our distribution system and broadening of our product line.
 
 
 
     Our goal for 2004 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 17% excluding the impact of the yen. For 2005 our objective is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. We believe these financial objectives are a reasonable reflection of the growth opportunities we see in the two largest insurance markets in the world.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This document contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by company officials in oral discussions with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia - July 27, 2004 -- AFLAC Incorporated today reported its second quarter results. Total revenues, which reflected a stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate, were $3.2 billion in the second quarter, or 13.0% higher than a year ago. Net earnings were $265 million, or $.51 per diluted share, compared with $248 million, or $.48 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2004 included a loss of $23 million, or $.04 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. In the second quarter of 2003, net earnings benefited by $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133. Realized investment losses were $.01 per diluted share in the second quarters of 2004 and 2003.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of AFLAC's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps as required by SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of AFLAC's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact of SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events and therefore obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in AFLAC's insurance operations.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $291 million, compared with $240 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 21.7% to $.56 per diluted share, compared with $.46 per share in the second quarter of 2003. Excluding the benefit of $.02 per share from the stronger yen to the dollar, operating earnings per share increased 17.4% for the quarter.
For the six months of 2004, total revenues rose 14.9% to $6.5 billion. Net earnings were $581 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared with $486 million, or $.93 per share, for the first six months of 2003. Operating earnings for the six months were $587 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared with $483 million, or $.92 per share, in 2003.
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.095 per share is payable on September 1, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 13, 2004.
Commenting on the company's second quarter and first-half results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, we are pleased with our results so far in 2004. We are especially pleased that operating earnings per share growth before currency translation was in line with our annual target of a 17% increase.
"AFLAC U.S. produced total new annualized premium sales in the second quarter of $281 million, or 6.4% above the second quarter of 2003. Accident/disability remained the principal contributor to new sales in the quarter, accounting for approximately 52% of second quarter sales. For the six months, new sales were up 10.0% to $573 million. Our first-half sales results were in line with our annual sales target of a 10% to 12% increase. And we believe the changes we made to our coordinator base and training in past quarters will enable us to achieve our target for the full year.
"AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the second quarter declined 2.3% from a year ago to 32.2 billion yen, or $294 million. For the six months, total new annualized premium sales were up .9% to 60.5 billion yen, or $557 million. Sales growth continued to be impacted by significant declines in Rider MAX conversions and sales from Dai-ichi Mutual Life, compared with 2003. Excluding conversions and the contribution from Dai-ichi, sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 5.8% for the first six months. We indicated in the first quarter that we expect better sales growth in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that our sales growth will improve. However, based on our first-half sales results, it appears that sales will likely be up 3% to 7% for the full year.
"Although we are disappointed that our sales results were not better in Japan, we are convinced that we will see better growth in the second half of the year. EVER continues to be the best-selling stand-alone medical product in Japan's life insurance industry and we will introduce two new products in August. We are also encouraged that investment yields in Japan have risen significantly this year, which should benefit future investment income growth. And the persistency of our Japanese business has improved to its highest level since the end of 2001. Even though we view 2004 as a transition year for AFLAC U.S., we still expect to see double-digit sales growth for the year. With the significant changes we made to our sales force infrastructure and training programs last year, and a renewed focus on new agent recruiting this year, we believe we are positioning AFLAC U.S. for even faster sales growth in 2005.
"Our goal for 2004 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 17% excluding the impact of the yen. For 2005, our objective is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. And in May we established a 2006 objective of a 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the effect of currency. We believe our earnings objectives reflect the opportunities we see for continued growth and our strong competitive position in the United States and Japan. More importantly, we believe our objectives are achievable."

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis increased 17.4% for the second quarter excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (including the effect of the yen, operating earnings per share were up 21.7%).
We purchased 1.3 million of AFLAC's shares in the second quarter.
In May we established a target for increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15% in 2006 before the effect of currency translation.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     With the first half of the year complete, we remain very pleased with the financial performance of AFLAC U.S. and AFLAC Japan. Most importantly, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our primary financial objective for 2004 of a 17% increase in operating earnings per share before the impact of currency translation.
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
     The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate enhanced the growth rates of our financial results in the second quarter. Total revenues rose 13.0% to $3.2 billion. Net earnings were $265 million, or $.51 per diluted share, compared with $248 million, or $.48 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2004 included realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per share, compared with realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter also included a loss of $23 million, or $.04 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the second quarter of 2003, SFAS 133 benefited net earnings by $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share.
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of AFLAC's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps as required by SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of AFLAC's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact of SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events and therefore can obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in AFLAC's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating earnings to net earnings appears on page six.
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We translate AFLAC Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for AFLAC and not an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because the effect of translating yen into dollars distorts the rate of growth of our insurance operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart on page four compares selected income statemen t items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of the yen.
 
     Operating earnings in the second quarter of 2004 were $291 million, compared with $240 million in the second quarter of 2003. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 21.7% to $.56, compared with $.46 in the second quarter of 2003. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per share by $.02 during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 17.4%, which was in line with our stated annual objective for operating earnings per share growth in 2004.
     During the second quarter, we acquired 1.3 million shares of AFLAC stock. As of June 30, 2004, we had approximately 33 million shares available for purchase under current repurchase authorizations from the board of directors.
SIX MONTH RESULTS
     Benefiting from the stronger yen, total revenues advanced 14.9% to $6.5 billion in the first half of 2004. Net earnings were $581 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, compared with $486 million, or $.93 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first half of 2004 included realized investment gains of $3 million, or nil per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $10 million, or $.02 per share, a year ago. Net earnings also included a loss of $12 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133, compared with a gain of $13 million, or $.03 per share for the first six months of 2003. In addition, net earnings in 2004 reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain AFLAC Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government.
     Operating earnings for the six months were $587 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, compared with $483 million, or $.92 per share in 2003. Excluding the $.05 per share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 17.4%.
AFLAC JAPAN
     AFLAC Japan's premium income in yen increased 6.8% in the quarter. Net investment income was up 2.4%. Investment income growth in yen terms was restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 31% of AFLAC Japan's investment income is dollar-denominated. Total revenues rose 6.0%. During the second quarter, we temporarily stopped development of AFLAC Japan's new administrative system to evaluate the future direction and scope of the project. In doing so, we determined it was appropriate to write down 2.85 billion yen, or $26 million before taxes, in previously capitalized systems development costs. Despite these additional expenses, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 13.3% to 14.2% due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio. As a result, pretax operating earnings increased 13.1% in the second quarter. For the six months in yen, premium income increased 6.6%, while net investment income rose .9%. Total revenues were up 5.6% and pretax operating earnings grew 11.7%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 109.73 in the second quarter was 8.0% stronger than the average rate of 118.49 in the second quarter of 2003. For the six months, the average exchange rate was 108.52, or 9.4% stronger than the rate of 118.71 a year ago. The strengthening of the yen for the quarter and the first half of the year magnified the growth rates of AFLAC Japan as reported in dollars.
     Benefiting from the stronger yen, second-quarter premium income in dollars increased 15.3% to $2.0 billion. Net investment income was up 10.6% to $385 million. Total revenues rose 14.5% to $2.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $344 million, an increase of 22.1% from a year ago. For the six months, premium income rose 16.7% to $4.1 billion. Net investment income was up 10.4% to $761 million. Total revenues increased 15.5% to $4.9 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $693 million, or 22.2% higher than a year ago.
 
     Investment yields in Japan improved in the second quarter of 2004. For example, the yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds rose from an average of 1.87% in the first quarter to an average of 2.18% in the second quarter. By the end of June, the yield on the 20-year Japanese government bond index was at its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2000. During the second quarter, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 3.51%. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 3.63%. As of July 23, 2004, we had invested, or committed to invest, approximately 75% of our expected 2004 cash flow at an average yield of 3.21%.
     AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the second quarter declined 2.3% from a year ago to 32.2 billion yen, or $294 million. For the six months, total new annualized premium sales were up .9% to 60.5 billion yen, or $557 million. As we expected, sales growth continued to be impacted by significant declines in Rider MAX conversions and sales from Dai-ichi Mutual Life, compared with 2003. Excluding conversions and the contribution from Dai-ichi, sales were up 2.5% for the quarter and 5.8% for the first six months. Our stand-alone supplemental medical policy, EVER, remained the number one medical product in the life insurance industry in terms of policy sales during the quarter. And it was the top contributor to our sales in the quarter. Stand-alone medical sales represented 30% of total new annualized premium sales and increased 12% over the second quarter of 2003. We indicated in the first quarter that we expect better sales growth in the second half of th e year. We continue to believe that sales growth will improve. However, based on our first-half sales results, it appears that sales will likely be up 3% to 7% for the full year.
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. produced premium income of $726 million in the second quarter, an increase of 14.0% over a year ago. Net investment income rose 12.7% to $98 million. Total revenues increased 13.8% to $827 million. Pretax operating earnings were up 16.8% to $121 million. For the six months, premium income rose 13.9% to $1.4 billion, and net investment income was up 11.7% to $195 million. Total revenues increased 13.6% to $1.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings climbed 15.6% to $244 million.
     AFLAC U.S. produced total new annualized premium sales in the second quarter of $281 million, or 6.4% above the second quarter of 2003. Accident/disability remained the principal contributor to new sales, accounting for approximately 52% of second quarter sales. For the six months, new sales were up 10.0% to $573 million. Our first-half sales results were in line with our annual sales target of a 10% to 12% increase. And we believe the changes we made to our coordinator base and training in past quarters will enable us to achieve our target for the full year.
     With our sales management infrastructure expanded and new training programs in place, our focus is to now stimulate recruiting. Recruitment of new sales associates declined 5.2% in the second quarter, compared with a year ago. However, we did add more than 6,000 new sales associates in the quarter, which was higher than the number recruited in the first quarter. At the end of the second quarter, AFLAC U.S. was represented by 58,400 licensed sales associates, which was 2.3% higher than a year ago. We expect to see better growth in the number of sales associates as the year progresses.
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.095 per share is payable on September 1, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 13, 2004.
 
OUTLOOK
     Overall, we are pleased with our results so far in 2004. We are especially pleased that operating earnings per share growth before currency translation was in line with this year's target of a 17% increase. Although we are disappointed that our sales results were not better in Japan, we are convinced that we will see better growth in the second half of the year. EVER continues to be the best-selling stand-alone medical product in Japan's life insurance industry and we will introduce two new products in August. We are also encouraged that investment yields in Japan have risen significantly this year, which should benefit future investment income growth. And the persistency of our Japanese business has improved to its highest level since the end of 2001. Even though we view 2004 as a transition year for AFLAC U.S., we still expect to see double-digit sales growth for the year. With the significant changes we made to our sales force infrastructure and training programs la st year, and a renewed focus on new agent recruiting this year, we believe we are positioning AFLAC U.S. for even faster sales growth in 2005.
     Our goal for 2004 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 17% excluding the impact of the yen. For 2005, our objective is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. And in May we established a 2006 objective of a 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the effect of currency. We believe our earnings objectives reflect the opportunities we see for continued growth and our strong competitive position in both the United States and Japan. More importantly, we believe our objectives are achievable.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
COLUMBUS, Georgia - October 26, 2004 - AFLAC Incorporated today reported its third quarter results. Total revenues, which reflected a stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate, were $3.3 billion in the third quarter, or 13.3% higher than a year ago. Net earnings were $301 million, or $.58 per diluted share, compared with $237 million, or $.45 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2004 included a gain of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. In the third quarter of 2003, net earnings included a loss of $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133. Realized investment losses were $.01 per diluted share in the third quarters of 2004 and 2003.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of AFLAC's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the change in the fair value of the interest rate component of cross-currency swaps as required by SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of AFLAC's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact of SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in AFLAC's insurance operations.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $299 million, compared with $245 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 23.4% to $.58 per diluted share, compared with $.47 per share in the third quarter of 2003. Excluding the benefit of $.02 per share from the stronger yen to the dollar, operating earnings per share increased 19.1% for the quarter.
For the first nine months of 2004, total revenues rose 14.3% to $9.8 billion. Net earnings were $881 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, compared with $723 million, or $1.38 per share, a year ago. Operating earnings were $886 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared with $728 million, or $1.39 per share, in 2003. Excluding the benefit of $.07 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 18.0% for the first nine months of 2004.
The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend. The fourth quarter dividend of $.095 per share is payable on December 1, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 12, 2004.
Commenting on the company's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2004. Yet, we are disappointed that we did not produce better sales growth in Japan and the United States.
"AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the third quarter declined 2.9% from a year ago to 28.6 billion yen, or $260 million. For the nine months, total new annualized premium sales were down .4% to 89.2 billion yen, or $818 million. Sales growth in the quarter was again impacted by sharp declines in Rider MAX conversions and significantly lower sales from Dai-ichi Mutual Life, compared with 2003. Conversions were down 54.3% from a year ago, and sales through Dai-ichi dropped 32.0%. Excluding conversions and the contribution from Dai-ichi, sales were up 4.5% for the quarter and 5.4% for the nine months. We currently expect fourth quarter sales to increase at a low-single-digit rate, which will result in flat sales to a slight increase for the full year.
"AFLAC U.S. produced total new annualized premium sales in the third quarter of $270 million, or 2.7% above the third quarter of 2003. For the first nine months, new sales were up 7.6% to $843 million. Although we believe the rate of sales growth in the fourth quarter will improve compared with the third quarter, we still expect a low- to mid-single-digit sales increase for the remaining three months of the year. Therefore, we do not expect to meet our full-year sales objective of a 10% to 12% increase in 2004. New sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the hurricanes that devastated areas of the Southeast. Sales in Florida and Alabama were especially soft compared with their rates of sales growth in the first half of the year. However, we believe the overall weak sales growth primarily resulted from the sweeping changes we made to our sales management team last year. Those changes are continuing to impact recruiting, productivity and, consequently, sales.
"We expect new agent recruiting in the United States to improve as sales coordinators who were promoted at the start of the year become better adjusted to the responsibilities of their new positions. We also believe we can improve retention and productivity of sales associates as we continue to intensely focus on recently adopted training initiatives. Ultimately, we believe these actions will lead to better recruiting and faster sales growth in the United States. We are also encouraged about the outlook for our operations in Japan. Although we have seen a proliferation of supplemental insurance products in recent years, AFLAC is still the best branded company for the sale of cancer life and medical insurance, which represent our top two product categories in Japan. We also plan to introduce a new medical insurance product in early 2005 to extend our leadership position.
"Most important, our financial performance continues to be strong. The financial results of AFLAC U.S. and AFLAC Japan have met or exceeded expectations throughout the year. With our consolidated year-to-date operating earnings running ahead of target, we plan to spend more on marketing expenses in the fourth quarter to stimulate sales. As a result, we expect to produce fourth quarter operating earnings per diluted share of approximately $.57 before the impact of the yen. If the yen/dollar exchange rate averages 110 in the fourth quarter, reported operating earnings will likely be $.56 per diluted share.
"Clearly, we are very confident that full-year operating earnings per diluted share will increase 17% in 2004, excluding the impact of the yen. Our goal is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% in 2005 and 2006 before currency translation. We also believe our earnings targets for the next two years are achievable. Our ability to generate strong earnings growth despite slow sales growth reflects the underlying strength and resilience of our operations and business model. We remain committed to providing valued products and services to our customers, and solid growth for our shareholders. "

HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 19.1% for the third quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (including the effect of the yen, operating earnings per share increased 23.4%).
We purchased 2.5 million of AFLAC's shares in the third quarter.
Consumers voted the AFLAC Duck as America's second most popular advertising icon in an online poll sponsored by the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
     Overall, we are very pleased with AFLAC's financial results for the third quarter and for the first nine months of the year. Although sales in the United States and Japan were below our expectations, our view of those markets has not changed. Most important, our financial results remained strong and operating earnings per share growth exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Based on our results for the first nine months of the year, we are confident that we will achieve our primary financial objective for 2004 of a 17% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency translation.      The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate continued to benefit our reported results. Reflecting the stronger yen, total revenues increased 13.3% to $3.3 billion in the third quarter. Net earnings were $301 million, or $.58 per diluted share, compared with $237 million, or $.45 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2004 included realized investment losses of $4 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $6 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the third quarter also included a gain of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the third quarter of 2003, the impact of SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of AFLAC's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of AFLAC's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact of SFAS 133 and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore can obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in AFLAC's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating earnings to net earnings appears on Page 5.
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We translate AFLAC Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for AFLAC and not an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because the effect of translating yen into dollars distorts the rate of growth of our insurance operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart on Page 4 compares selected income statement i tems with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of the yen.
     Operating earnings in the third quarter of 2004 were $299 million, compared with $245 million in the third quarter of 2003. Operating earnings per diluted share advanced 23.4% to $.58, compared with $.47 in the third quarter of 2003. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per share by $.02 during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 19.1%, which exceeds our stated annual objective for operating earnings per share growth in 2004.
     During the third quarter, we purchased 2.5 million shares of AFLAC stock. As of September 30, 2004, we had approximately 30 million shares available for purchase under current authorizations from the board of directors.      Our results for the first nine months of the year have also benefited from the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate. Total revenues rose 14.3% to $9.8 billion in the first nine months of 2004. Net earnings were $881 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, compared with $723 million, or $1.38 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first nine months of 2004 included realized investment losses of $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $16 million, or $.03 per share, a year ago. Net earnings also included a loss of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the effect of SFAS 133, compared with a gain of $11 million, or $.02 per share, for the first nine months of 2003. In addition, net earnings in 2004 reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain AFLAC Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government.
NINE-MONTH RESULTS
     Operating earnings for the nine months were $886 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared with $728 million, or $1.39 per share, in 2003. Excluding the $.07 per share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share increased 18.0%.      AFLAC Japan's premium income in yen increased 6.9% in the quarter. Net investment income was up 2.7%. Investment income growth in yen terms was restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 31% of AFLAC Japan's investment income is dollar-denominated. Total revenues rose 6.1%. The pretax operating profit margin expanded to 14.2%, compared with 12.7% a year ago, due to improvement in the expense ratio. As a result, pretax operating earnings increased 18.9% in the third quarter. For the nine months in yen, premium income increased 6.7%, while net investment income rose 1.5%. Total revenues were up 5.8%, and pretax operating earnings grew 14.1%.
AFLAC JAPAN
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 109.95 in the third quarter was 7.1% stronger than the average rate of 117.76 in the third quarter of 2003. For the nine months, the average exchange rate was 109.00, or 8.6% stronger than the rate of 118.39 a year ago. The strengthening of the yen in 2004 has magnified the growth rates of AFLAC Japan as reported in dollars.
     Benefiting from the stronger yen, third quarter premium income in dollars increased 14.3% to $2.1 billion. Net investment income was up 9.8% to $390 million. Total revenues rose 13.5% to $2.5 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $351 million, an increase of 27.3% from a year ago. For the nine months, premium income rose 15.9% to $6.2 billion. Net investment income was up 10.2% to $1.2 billion. Total revenues were $7.3 billion, or 14.8% higher than a year ago. Pretax operating earnings were $1.0 billion, an increase of 23.9% over the first nine months of 2003.
     Japanese investment yields remained at levels above 2003, although they declined from their peak earlier this year. The yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 2.24% in the third quarter of 2004, compared with 1.69% a year ago. At the end of September, the yield on the 20-year Japanese government bond index was at 2.07%. During the third quarter, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.27%. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new-money yield for the quarter was 3.43%.
     AFLAC Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the third quarter declined 2.9% from a year ago to 28.6 billion yen, or $260 million. For the nine months, total new annualized premium sales were down .4% to 89.2 billion yen, or $818 million. Sales growth in the quarter was again impacted by sharp declines in Rider MAX conversions and significantly lower sales from Dai-ichi Mutual Life, compared with 2003. Conversions were down 54.3% from a year ago, and sales through Dai-ichi dropped 32.0%. Excluding conversions and the contribution from Dai-ichi, sales were up 4.5% for the quarter and 5.4% for the nine months. We currently expect fourth quarter sales to increase at a low-single-digit rate, which will result in flat sales to a slight increase for the full year.
     Our stand-alone medical policy, EVER, was the largest contributor to AFLAC Japan's third quarter sales. Although medical sales were down slightly from the third quarter of 2003, AFLAC Japan remained the number one seller of medical insurance in the life insurance industry in terms of policy sales. To draw consumers' attention to this market-leading position, we recently launched a new advertising campaign, which we believe will benefit fourth quarter sales. We also introduced a newly revised version of Rider Wide in the third quarter. As a rider to our popular cancer life policy, Rider Wide provides benefits for heart attack and stroke.      AFLAC U.S. premium income increased 12.8% to $745 million in the third quarter. Net investment income rose 8.4% to $100 million. Total revenues were up 12.3% to $847 million, while pretax operating earnings increased 10.0% to $128 million. For the nine months, premium income rose 13.5% to $2.2 billion, and net investment income was up 10.5% to $295 million. Total revenues increased 13.2% to $2.5 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 13.6% to $372 million.
AFLAC U.S.
     AFLAC U.S. produced total new annualized premium sales in the third quarter of $270 million, or 2.7% above the third quarter of 2003. For the first nine months, new sales were up 7.6% to $843 million. Although we believe the rate of sales growth in the fourth quarter will improve compared with the third quarter, we still expect a low- to mid-single-digit sales increase for the remaining three months of the year. Therefore, we do not expect to meet our full-year sales objective of a 10% to 12% increase in 2004. New sales in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the hurricanes that devastated areas of the Southeast. Sales in Florida and Alabama were especially soft compared with their rates of sales growth in the first half of the year. However, we believe the overall weak sales growth primarily resulted from the sweeping changes we made to our sales management team last year. Those changes are continuing to impact recruiting, productivity and consequently, sales .
     Recruitment in the third quarter was down 1.2% from a year ago, compared with a 5.2% decline in the second quarter. We expect new agent recruiting in the United States to improve as sales coordinators who were promoted at the start of the year become better adjusted to the responsibilities of their new positions. We also believe we can improve retention and productivity of sales associates as we continue to intensely focus on recently adopted training initiatives. Ultimately, we believe these actions will lead to better recruiting and faster sales growth in the United States.
     The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend. The fourth quarter dividend of $.095 per share is payable on December 1, 2004, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 12, 2004.      Although we are disappointed with our sales growth this year, we remain excited about the longer term sales opportunities in the United States and Japan. We expect out-of-pocket expenses for consumers will continue to rise, resulting in a greater financial burden for families who have experienced a serious health event. As such, we believe our products are well suited to the millions of consumers in the two largest markets in the world.
DIVIDEND
OUTLOOK
     Most important, our financial performance continues to be strong. The financial results of AFLAC U.S. and AFLAC Japan have met or exceeded expectations throughout the year. With our consolidated year-to-date operating earnings running ahead of target, we plan to spend more on marketing expenses in the fourth quarter to stimulate sales. As a result, we expect to produce fourth quarter operating earnings per diluted share of approximately $.57 before the impact of the yen. If the yen/dollar exchange rate averages 110 in the fourth quarter, reported operating earnings will likely be $.56 per diluted share.
     Clearly, we are very confident that full-year operating earnings per diluted share will increase 17% in 2004, excluding the impact of the yen. Our goal is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% in 2005 and 2006 before currency translation. We also believe our earnings targets for the next two years are achievable. Our ability to generate strong earnings growth despite slow sales growth reflects the underlying strength and resilience of our operations and business model. We remain committed to providing valued products and services to our customers, and solid growth for our shareholders.

EXHIBIT 99.1
AFLAC Promotes Akitoshi Kan to Chairman, AFLAC International; Appoints Paul S. Amos II to AFLAC U.S. Executive Vice President
COLUMBUS, Ga., Nov. 15 - AFLAC Incorporated announced today that Akitoshi Kan has been promoted to chairman of AFLAC International. This promotion follows AFLAC Japan President Charles Lake's more active involvement in the company's strategic and policy initiatives in Japan. Lake will remain president of AFLAC Japan and will concentrate on regulatory issues. The company also announced today that Paul S. Amos II has been appointed executive vice president, AFLAC U.S. operations. These changes are effective January 1, 2005.
Kan, a graduate of Kanagawa University in Japan, joined AFLAC Japan's financial department in 1980. Prior to relocating to AFLAC's Worldwide Headquarters in 1999, he was executive vice president of internal operations for AFLAC Japan. Since 1999, Kan has served as executive vice president of AFLAC U.S. internal operations, where his responsibilities include the administration of AFLAC's U.S. insurance operations. In his new capacity, he will oversee all operations of AFLAC in Japan.
Amos received a bachelor's degree in economics from Duke University and a master's of business administration from Emory University. He also earned a juris doctorate from Tulane University. Amos joined AFLAC in 2002 as state sales coordinator of Georgia North. Today Georgia North ranks number one among all of AFLAC's 87 state operations in terms of total new annualized premium sales and has produced a 26% increase in new sales for the first nine months of 2004.
"I look forward to working with Aki and Paul in their new roles for years to come, and I believe they will enhance our management team and strengthen our organization," said AFLAC Incorporated Chairman and CEO Daniel P. Amos. "I am also pleased with Charles' leadership in the policy area. As a former director of Japan affairs for the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Charles will be a great advocate for U.S. insurers at a time when the insurance industry faces the unique challenges presented by deregulation of banking distribution and Japan's postal insurance system.
"Aki has extensive knowledge of the Japanese market and our operations in Japan. He has produced a lengthy record of success in Japan and the United States during his career with AFLAC, and he leaves AFLAC U.S. in a very strong position from an administrative standpoint. At the same time, Paul brings discipline that will enable us to continue improving our operating efficiency. We can also benefit from his first-hand knowledge of the U.S. market and the management techniques that have led to Georgia North becoming our top state operation. These men have the skills, drive and energy that will help us maintain our market-leading positions in both the United States and Japan and promote synergy within our operations."

EXHIBIT INDEX:
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - January 31, 2005 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Total revenues, which reflected a stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate, were $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, or 21.1% higher than a year ago. Net earnings were $418 million, or $.81 per diluted share, compared with $73 million, or $.14 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 included realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $175 million, or $.34 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Net earnings in the fourth quarter also included a loss of $7 million, or $.02 per diluted share, as a result of the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $14 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Fourth quarter net earnings in 2004 also benefited by $128 million, or $.25 per diluted share, fro m a release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $300 million, compared with $262 million a year ago. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.0% to $.59, compared with $.50 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003.
For the year, total revenues rose 16.0% to $13.3 billion in 2004. Net earnings were $1.3 billion, or $2.52 per diluted share, compared with $795 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, a year ago. Operating earnings were $1.2 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $989 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, in 2003. Excluding the benefit of $.08 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share increased 17.5% for the year.
The board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend 15.8% from $.095 to $.11 per share, effective with the first quarter of 2005. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2005. This marks the 22 consecutive year in which the cash dividend has been increased.
nd
Commenting on the company's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We were pleased that Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales were better than our expectations for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, new sales increased 5.3% from a year ago to a record 33.4 billion yen, or $316 million. New sales in the quarter benefited from solid sales growth of the medical and ordinary life categories. Total new annualized premium sales were up 1.1% to 122.5 billion yen, or $1.1 billion for the full year. New sales growth in 2004 was held down by declines in Rider MAX sales and conversions in addition to lower sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life. Excluding sales through Dai-ichi, sales from our traditional channels were up 9.3% in the fourth quarter and 4.0% for the year.
"We introduced two new versions of EVER in January 2005 in order to better segment the market and extend the growth of medical sales. We believe the added benefits of the new products will appeal to a broader group of consumers. We also believe that the continued expansion of our product line and sales force, combined with Aflac's leading market position, will enable us to produce a 5% to 10% increase in total new annualized premium sales in yen for 2005.
"Aflac U.S. produced total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter of $343 million, a .5% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2003. For the year, total new sales were up 5.1% to $1.2 billion. These results were below our expectations for both the quarter and for the year. We continue to believe our slower sales growth has resulted primarily from the significant changes we made to our sales management team in 2003 and at the start of 2004. While we believe the basics of our infrastructure are in place, we will continue to focus on providing resources and support to strengthen, train, and grow our sales force.
"We are convinced that the best approach to the vast U.S. market potential is to expand our distribution system and our product line. In that regard, we were encouraged that recruitment of new sales associates picked up in the fourth quarter. New agent recruitment rose 5.9% in the fourth quarter, which was the largest increase we have experienced since the fourth quarter of 2002. We have also restructured our training department and are intensifying our training efforts, which we hope will lead to improved agent retention and productivity. In the product area, we recently developed an innovative vision product that will be rolled out to the market in mid-2005. We believe it is unique to the marketplace, and we look for vision care to be a solid addition to our already strong product line. We are convinced we are taking the correct steps to re-ignite new sales growth. However, we believe new sales in the first quarter of 2005 will likely decline, due in part to difficult comparisons to 2004. As a result, we believe it will be the second quarter at the earliest before we see improved growth. As such, we have established a target of a 3% to 8% increase in new sales for 2005.
"Our view of the U.S. and Japanese markets has not changed, and we remain encouraged about the outlook for our business. We believe rising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers will drive a growing need for the products we sell. Furthermore, we believe our business model is sound, and that our many competitive strengths are intact.
"We are very pleased that our financial results kept pace with our expectations throughout 2004. And we are proud that we exceeded our primary financial objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 17% in 2004, excluding the impact of the yen. Our ability to achieve financial targets when new sales are soft reflects the underlying strength of our operations. Due to that strength, our goals for 2005 and 2006 remain unchanged. Our objective is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% in 2005 and 2006 before currency translation."

HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 16.0% in the fourth quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (including the effect of the yen, operating earnings per share increased 18.0%).
We purchased 3.1 million of Aflac's shares in the fourth quarter.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales exceeded expectations in the quarter.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     The fourth quarter concluded a year of record financial results for Aflac Incorporated. In every quarter of 2004, we were very pleased with the strong financial performance our operations produced. At the same time, however, we were disappointed with the rate of new sales growth in both Japan and the United States. Although new sales increased in each market for the year, we fell short of our sales growth targets. Yet despite weaker sales, we exceeded our primary financial objective of a 17% increase in operating earnings per diluted share for the year before the impact of currency translation.
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
     Aflac's results were again helped by the stronger yen in relation to the dollar. Reflecting the stronger yen, total revenues were $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2004, up 21.1% from $2.8 billion in 2003. Net earnings were $418 million, or $.81 per diluted share, compared with $73 million, or $.14 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 included realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $175 million, or $.34 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2003. Net earnings in the fourth quarter also included a loss of $7 million, or $.02 per diluted share, as a result of the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes as required by SFAS 133. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $14 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Fourth-quarter net earnings in 2 004 also benefited by $128 million, or $.25 per diluted share, from a release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore can obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating to net earnings appears on Page 5.
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating Japanese yen into U.S. dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because the effect of translating yen into dollars distorts the rate of growth of our insurance operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart on Page 4 compares selected income statement i tems with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of the yen.
 
     Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $300 million, compared with $262 million a year ago. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.0% to $.59, compared with $.50 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2003.
     During the fourth quarter, we purchased 3.1 million shares of Aflac stock. That brought the total number of shares purchased in 2004 to 10 million. We had approximately 27 million shares available for purchase under authorization from the board of directors as of December 31, 2004.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
     Like the fourth quarter, our results for the year were favorably impacted by the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate. Total revenues rose 16.0% to $13.3 billion in 2004, compared with $11.4 billion in 2003. Net earnings were $1.3 billion, or $2.52 per diluted share, compared with $795 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share in 2004, compared with realized investment losses of $191 million, or $.37 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings also included a loss of $13 million, or $.03 per diluted share, from the impact from SFAS 133, compared with a loss of $3 million in 2003. In addition, net earnings in 2004 reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain Aflac Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government and a benefit of $128 million, or $.25 per diluted share, from the release of the valuation allo wance for deferred tax assets.
     Operating earnings for the year were $1.2 billion, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared with $989 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, in 2003. Excluding the $.08 per share benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share increased 17.5%, which was better than our goal for the year.
AFLAC JAPAN
     In the fourth quarter of 2004, Aflac Japan's premium income in yen increased 6.8% and net investment income rose 4.8%. Investment income growth in yen terms was again restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 30% of Aflac Japan's investment income is dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 6.6%. The pretax operating profit margin improved to 13.9%, compared with 12.6% a year ago, due to a lower benefit ratio. As a result, pretax operating earnings increased 17.6% in the fourth quarter. For the year, premium income grew 6.7%, while net investment income increased 2.3%. Total revenues were up 6.0%, and pretax operating earnings rose 14.9%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 106.26 in the fourth quarter was 2.6% stronger than the average rate of 109.06 in the fourth quarter of 2003. For the year, the average exchange rate was 108.26, or 7.1% stronger than the rate of 115.95 a year ago. The stronger yen in relation to the dollar for both the quarter and the year magnified the growth rates of Aflac Japan as reported in dollars.
     Benefiting from the stronger yen, fourth quarter premium income in dollars increased 9.8% to $2.2 billion. Net investment income was up 7.8% to $406 million. Total revenues rose 9.7% to $2.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $359 million, an increase of 20.9% from a year ago. For the year in dollars, premium income rose 14.2% to $8.4 billion. Net investment income was up 9.6% to $1.6 billion. Total revenues were $9.9 billion, or 13.4% higher than a year ago. Pretax operating earnings were $1.4 billion, an increase of 23.1% over 2003.
 
     In the fourth quarter, Japanese investment yields declined slightly, compared with the third quarter, although they were higher than in the fourth quarter of 2003. The yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 2.08% in fourth quarter of 2004, compared with 2.24% in the third quarter and 1.87% a year ago. During the fourth quarter, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.65%. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 2.86%.
     We were pleased that Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales were better than our expectations for the quarter. In the fourth quarter, new sales increased 5.3% from a year ago to 33.4 billion yen, or $316 million. New sales in the quarter benefited from solid sales growth of the medical and ordinary life categories. Total new annualized premium sales were up 1.1% to 122.5 billion yen, or $1.1 billion for the full year. New sales growth in 2004 was held down by declines in Rider MAX sales and conversions in addition to lower sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life. Excluding sales through Dai-ichi, sales from our traditional channels were up 9.3% in the fourth quarter and 4.0% for the year.
a record
     We introduced two new versions of EVER in January 2005 in order to better segment the market and extend the growth of medical sales. We believe the added benefits of the new products will appeal to a broader group of consumers. We also believe that the continued expansion of our product line and sales force, combined with Aflac's leading market position, will enable us to produce a 5% to 10% increase in total new annualized premium sales in yen for 2005.
AFLAC U.S.
     Aflac U.S. premium income rose 11.9% to $753 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net investment income was up 6.1% to $101 million. Total revenues increased 11.2% to $857 million and pretax operating earnings grew 5.9% to $130 million. For the year, premium income was $2.9 billion, an increase of 13.1% over 2003. Net investment income rose 9.4% to $396 million. Total revenues increased 12.6% to $3.3 billion. Pretax operating earnings were up 11.5% to $502 million.
     Aflac U.S. produced total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter of $343 million, a .5% decrease from the fourth quarter of 2003. For the year, total new sales were up 5.1% to $1.2 billion. These results were below our expectations for both the quarter and for the year. We continue to believe our slower sales growth has resulted primarily from the significant changes we made to our sales management team in 2003 and at the start of 2004. While we believe the basics of our infrastructure are in place, we will continue to expand, train and strengthen all areas of our sales force.
     We are convinced that the best approach to the vast U.S. market potential is to expand our distribution system and our product line. In that regard, we were encouraged that recruitment of new sales associates picked up in the fourth quarter. New agent recruitment rose 5.9% in the fourth quarter, which was the largest increase we have experienced since the fourth quarter of 2002. We have also restructured our training department and are intensifying our training efforts, which we hope will lead to improved agent retention and productivity.

We believe it is unique to the marketplace, and we look for vision care to be a solid addition to our already strong product line. We are convinced we are taking the correct steps to re-ignite new sales growth. However, we believe new sales in the first quarter of 2005 will likely decline, due in part to difficult comparisons to 2004. As a result, we believe it will be the second quarter at the earliest before we see improved growth. As such, we have established a target of a 3% to 8% increase in new sales for 2005.
 
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend 15.8% from $.095 to $.11 per share, effective with the first quarter of 2005. The first quarter dividend is payable on March 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2005. This marks the 22 consecutive year in which the cash dividend has been increased.
nd
OUTLOOK
     Our view of the U.S. and Japanese markets has not changed, and we remain encouraged about the outlook for our business. We believe rising out-of-pocket expenses for consumers will drive a growing need for the products we sell. Furthermore, we believe our business model is sound, and that our many competitive strengths are intact.
     We are very pleased that our financial results kept pace with our expectations throughout 2004. And we are proud that we exceeded our primary financial objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 17% in 2004, excluding the impact of the yen.

Our objective is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 15% in 2005 and 2006 before currency translation.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as otherwise provided herein, the Option may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated in any way, shall not be assignable by operation of law, and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process.

5.   .
Exercisability and Duration of the Option
          (a)  . The Option shall vest and become exercisable as set forth in the Notice of Grant.
Right to Exercise
          (b)  . Unless it expires earlier pursuant to Section 3, above, the Option shall expire as follows:
Duration of the Option
(i)  Upon the termination of Grantee's employment for Cause, the Option shall expire with respect to any Option Shares with respect to which it has not yet been exercised (whether vested or unvested).
(ii)  Upon the voluntary termination of the Grantee's employment with the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company) for any reason other than death, Disability or retirement (as described in clause (iv), below), the Option shall expire with respect to any Option Shares with respect to which it is not yet then vested. To the extent of any Option Shares with respect to which it is then vested, the Option may be exercised at any time during the three-month period following the date of employment termination, at which time the Option shall expire; provided that, if the Grantee has accumulated 15 years of credited service with the Company (within the meaning of the Company's Pension Plan) as of the date of such employment termination, the Option may be exercised at any time preceding the Expiration Date with respect to such vested Option Shares.
(iii)  Upon the termination of the Grantee's employment with the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company) by reason of death or Disability, the Option shall vest with respect to all Option Shares and may be exercised at any time preceding the Expiration Date.
(iv)  In cases of voluntary termination of employment with the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company) where the Grantee has attained normal retirement age and been credited with at least 5 years credited service within the meaning of the Company's Pension Plan, qualifies for full retirement benefits under the Company's Rule of Eighty (Rule of 80) within the meaning of the Company's Pension Plan, or becomes a sales associate of the Company (thereby becoming a sub-contractor of the Company), the Option shall vest with respect to all Option Shares and may be exercised at any time preceding the Expiration Date.
          (c)  . To exercise the Option as to all or any part of the Option Shares with respect to which the Option is vested and exercisable, the Grantee (or after the Grantee's death, the person authorized to exercise the Option as provided in Section 20 of the Plan) shall deliver written notice of such exercise to the Company official designated by the Committee (or, in absence of such designation, the Secretary of the Company). The notice shall be in such form as the Committee may require from time to time and identify the number of Option Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised, provided that the Option may not be exercised for a fraction of an Option Share. The date of receipt of such notice shall be deemed the date of exercise. If someone other than the Grantee exercises the Option, then such person must submit documentation reasonably acceptable to the Company verifying that such person has the legal right to exercise the Option.
Method of Exercise
          (d)  . Payment in full of the purchase price for the Option Shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option shall be made upon exercise of the Option in accordance with Section 7(c)(iii) of the Plan in cash or by tender of previously held Company Stock with a Fair Market Value as of the date of exercise equal to the exercise price, in each case under procedures established by the Committee pursuant to Section 7(c)(iii) of the Plan.
Payment

The Secretary of the Company shall have full authority to direct the proper officers of the Company to issue or transfer shares of Company Stock pursuant to the exercise of the Option.

Delivery of Option Shares
6.   .   The Option shall not be exercisable to any extent, and the Company shall not be obligated to transfer any Option Shares to the Grantee upon exercise of the Option, if such exercise, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, would violate the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act") or any other federal or state statutes having similar requirements as may be in effect at that time. The Company shall be under no obligation to register the Option Shares pursuant to the Securities Act or any other federal or state securities laws. Unless the Company has filed an effective registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act covering the exercise of the Option, the Grantee, upon purchasing the Option Shares shall be required to represent to the Company that the Grantee is acquiring such shares for investment purposes and not with a view to their sale or distribution, and each certificate for such shares shall ha ve printed or stamped thereon appropriate language, as determined by the Secretary of the Company. The Secretary of the Company may, in his or her discretion, require the Grantee, as a condition to the Company's obligation to deliver Option Shares hereunder, take such action as is necessary or advisable to ensure that issuance of the Option Shares will be in compliance with applicable law.
Certain Securities Law and Other Requirements
7.   .   Neither this Agreement nor any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall affect any right of the Grantee to continue as an employee of the Company or otherwise to provide services to the Company or any of its Affiliates.

10.  .   The Plan is hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement and made a part hereof, and the Option and this Agreement shall be subject to all terms and conditions of the Plan.

Notice of Grant of Stock Options

EXHIBIT 10.5
Effective <OptionDate>, you have been granted <aan> <LongType> (<ShortType>) to buy <SharesGranted_> shares of AFLAC INCORPORATED (the Company) stock at $<OptionPrice> per share under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan).
The shares underlying this option will become vested and exercisable in whole or in installments as of the date(s) or, as applicable, the attainment of the performance goal(s), as set out below (or both as the case may be):
Summary of Option Terms:
- Ten years from the effective date of the option, or until one of the following conditions exist.
Duration of Option
Involuntary termination (for Cause) - Vested and non-vested options will terminate immediately.
Voluntary termination (except for certain reasons listed below) - Non-vested options will terminate on the date of termination and
vested options will terminate at the end of the three-month period following termination unless you have accumulated fifteen years of credited service with the Company, whereby vested options will continue until the end of their original ten-year term.
Under certain of the following conditions, if applicable, an Incentive Stock Option (ISO) will retain its ISO status until the end of the three-month period following termination, at which time the ISO will lose its tax advantaged status, but will continue through its remaining duration (if any) as a non-qualifying stock option (NQ) which will require the payment of income and employment taxes at the time of the exercise of the option.
Upon involuntary termination due to death or becoming disabled (as defined in the Plan), unvested options will vest immediately on the date of termination. In the case of a termination caused by disability, any ISO will retain ISO status for a period of twelve months, and then the option will continue as a NQ option until the expiration of its original ten-year term. In the case of a termination caused by death, any ISO will remain exercisable as an ISO until the expiration of its original ten-year term.
Upon voluntary termination where you attain your normal retirement age with at least 5 years credited service, qualify for full retirement benefits under the Company's Rule of Eighty (Rule of 80), or where you qualify as a sales associate of the Company (thereby becoming a sub-contractor of the Company), any unvested option will immediately vest and (if applicable) retain its ISO status until the end of the three-month period after termination, after which it (and any other vested options that are not ISO's) will continue to the end of their original ten-year term as NQ options.
By your signature and the Company's signature below, you and the Company agree that these options are granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Stock Option Agreement relating to these options, which is attached to and made a part of this document.

ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
EXHIBIT INDEX:
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - April 26, 2005 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
On January 1, 2005, Aflac adopted the accounting standard SFAS 123R, which addresses accounting for share-based transactions, such as stock options. The company elected to adopt SFAS 123R using the modified-retrospective transition method. As a result, 2004 results have been adjusted to reflect the expensing of stock options.
Total revenues, which benefited from foreign currency translation, were $3.6 billion in the first quarter, or 8.5% higher than a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2005 were $328 million, or $.64 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $304 million, or $.59 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment gains of $2 million, compared with realized investment gains of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter also included a loss of $9 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the first quarter of 2004, the impact from SFAS 133 benefited net earnings by $11 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2004 also reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain Aflac Japan pension obligati ons to the Japanese government.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2005 were a record $335 million, compared with $284 million in the first quarter of 2004. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 20.0% to $.66, compared with $.55 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per share by $.01 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 18.2%, which was significantly better than our annual objective for operating earnings per share growth in 2005.
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.11 per share is payable on June 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2005.
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, we had a solid start in 2005. We are especially pleased that operating earnings per share growth before currency translation grew at a faster rate than our primary financial target of a 15% increase.
"Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales rose 5.3% in the first quarter to 29.8 billion yen, or $285 million. These sales results were in line with our expectations and our sales target for the year. As we expected, sales growth was restrained by continued declines in Rider MAX. And while sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life declined for the quarter, its results were better than we had expected. Excluding the contribution from Dai-ichi Life, sales were up 6.3% for the quarter. We were especially pleased that Aflac Japan produced very strong sales of medical products. Medical sales rose 28.5% and accounted for 40% of total new annualized premium sales for the quarter, benefiting from the successful introduction of EVER Half and EVER Bonus, our two new medical products. We believe agent and consumer reception of our new products is further affirmation of our number one position in the market for stand-alone medical insurance products in Japan. Our objective for the year is a 5% to 10% increase in total new annualized premium sales in yen.
"We were encouraged that Aflac U.S. sales were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Although total new annualized premium sales declined 2.1% to $286 million in the first quarter, we had expected a sales decline of up to 5% due primarily to a tough comparison to 2004. The difficult comparison resulted from fewer production days in the first quarter of 2005, compared with a year ago. Had the number of production days been the same in both quarters, we estimate sales would have increased in line with our annual objective. We were very pleased that new agent recruitment continued to improve. During the first quarter, we recruited more than 6,400 new sales associates, which was 10.3% above the first quarter of 2004. At the end of the first quarter, Aflac U.S. was represented by 60,300 licensed sales associates, or 4.6% higher than a year ago. We believe we will see improved sales momentum as the year progresses due in part to the continued expansion of our sales force. And we are also op timistic that the introduction of a new vision product will benefit sales in the second half of the year. Our objective for the year is a 3% to 8% increase in total new annualized premium sales.
"As we think about the remainder of this year and beyond, we are enthusiastic about the opportunities for our operations in both the United States and Japan. The United States remains a significant market for our products. And we believe we can tap into that potential by further expansion of our distribution system and product line, and enhanced training of our sales force. We also believe we can maintain our strong position in Japan's insurance market. With Japan's aging population and higher out-of-pocket expenses, we are convinced that consumers will increasingly turn to affordable products that provide 'living' benefits. Aflac Japan is the market leader for living-benefit products, and we believe we will maintain our number one position.
"We are also optimistic about achieving our financial objectives. Our goal for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding foreign currency translation. Based on the strength of our first quarter earnings, we believe we will have the opportunity to increase our sales promotion activities for the remainder of 2005 and still achieve our earnings objective for the year. For 2006 our goal is to again produce 15% growth in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. We believe these financial objectives reasonably reflect the market opportunities we see, as well as our expectation for continued margin expansion for Aflac Japan."
For 50 years, Aflac products have given policyholders the opportunity to direct cash where it is needed most when a life-interrupting medical event causes financial challenges. Aflac is the number one provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the number one insurance company in terms of individual insurance policies in force in Japan. Aflac's insurance products provide protection to more than 40 million people worldwide. In January 2005, Aflac was included in Fortune magazine's list of the 100 Best Companies to Work For in America for the seventh consecutive year. Aflac has also been included in both Forbes magazine's Platinum 400 List of America's Best Big Companies and in Fortune magazine's listing of America's Most Admired Companies for five consecutive years.

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 18.2% in the first quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (including the effect of the yen, operating earnings per share were up 20.0%).
We purchased 2.9 million shares of Aflac's common stock in the first quarter.
Sales results at Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan were in line with our expectations for the quarter.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     Overall, we are pleased with our start in 2005. Our first quarter financial results were strong and in line with our annual performance targets. Aflac Japan produced solid sales growth following the successful introduction of two new medical products. And while Aflac U.S. sales declined slightly, they were consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Most important, we exceeded our primary financial target for 2005 of a 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency translation.
FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
     On January 1, 2005, Aflac adopted the accounting standard SFAS 123R, which addresses accounting for share-based transactions, such as stock options. We elected to adopt SFAS 123R using the modified-retrospective transition method. As a result, we have adjusted 2004 results to reflect the expensing of stock options.
     Aflac's first quarter financial results benefited from the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, compared with the first quarter of 2004. Total revenues were up 8.5% to $3.6 billion. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2005 were $328 million, or $.64 per share on a diluted basis, compared with $304 million, or $.59 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment gains of $2 million, compared with realized investment gains of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter also included a loss of $9 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the first quarter of 2004, the impact from SFAS 133 benefited net earnings by $11 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2004 also reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted sh are, as a result of the transfer of certain Aflac Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government.
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating to net earnings appears on Page 5.
 
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate its balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart on Page 4 compares selected income stat ement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of those changes.
     Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2005 were a record $335 million, compared with $284 million in the first quarter of 2004. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 20.0% to $.66, compared with $.55 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per share by $.01 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 18.2%, which was significantly better than our annual objective for operating earnings per share growth in 2005.
     During the first quarter, we acquired 2.9 million shares of Aflac stock. As of March 31, 2005, approximately 24 million shares were available for purchase under our current share repurchase program.
AFLAC JAPAN
     Aflac Japan continued to produce solid results that were in line with our expectations. Premium income in yen increased 6.5% in the first quarter of 2005 and net investment income rose 6.4%. Investment income growth in yen terms was again held down by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate for the quarter because approximately 30% of Aflac Japan's investment income is derived from dollar-denominated investments. Total revenues rose 6.6%. Due to improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 13.9% to 14.9%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen were up 14.5%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2005 was 104.50, compared with an average rate of 107.32 in the first quarter of 2004. As a result of the 2.7% strengthening of the average exchange rate during the quarter, Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms were greater than increases on a yen basis.
     Reflecting the stronger yen, first quarter premium income in dollars increased 9.3% to $2.3 billion. Net investment income also rose 9.3% to $411 million. Total revenues were up 9.4% to $2.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings advanced 17.6% to $399 million.
     Investment yields in Japan declined slightly from the fourth quarter of 2004, although they remained higher than a year ago. For example, the yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 2.03% in the first quarter of 2005, compared with an average yield of 2.08% in the fourth quarter of 2004, and 1.87% in the first quarter of 2004. We purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.84% during the first quarter of 2005. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 3.06%. As of April 18, 2005, we had invested, or committed to invest, approximately 46% of our expected 2005 cash flow at an average yield of 3.05%.
 
     Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales rose 5.3% in the first quarter to 29.8 billion yen, or $285 million. These sales results were in line with our expectations and our sales target for the year. As we expected, sales growth was restrained by continued declines in Rider MAX. And while sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life declined for the quarter, its results were better than we had expected. Excluding the contribution from Dai-ichi Life, sales were up 6.3% for the quarter. We were especially pleased that Aflac Japan produced very strong sales of medical products. Medical sales rose 28.5% and accounted for 40% of total new annualized premium sales for the quarter, benefiting from the successful introduction of EVER Half and EVER Bonus, our two new medical products. We believe agent and consumer reception of these new products is further affirmation of our number one position in the market for stand-alone medical insurance products in Japan. Our objective for the year is a 5% to 10% increase in total new annualized premium sales in yen.
AFLAC U.S.
     Aflac U.S. produced solid financial results in the first quarter. Premium income increased 10.7% to $787 million. Net investment income rose 5.2% to $102 million. Total revenues were up 10.1% to $891 million. Pretax operating earnings were $133 million, an increase of 9.7%.
     We were encouraged that Aflac U.S. sales were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Although total new annualized premium sales declined 2.1% to $286 million in the first quarter, we had expected a sales decline of up to 5% due primarily to a tough comparison to 2004. The difficult comparison resulted from fewer production days in the first quarter of 2005, compared with a year ago. Had the number of production days been the same in both quarters, we estimate sales would have increased in line with our annual objective.
We believe we will see improved sales momentum as the year progresses due in part to the continued expansion of our sales force. And we are also optimistic that the introduction of a new vision product will benefit sales in the second half of the year. Our objective for the year is a 3% to 8% increase in total new annualized premium sales.
     We were very pleased that new agent recruitment continued to improve. During the first quarter, we recruited more than 6,400 new sales associates, which was 10.3% above the first quarter of 2004. At the end of the first quarter, Aflac U.S. was represented by 60,300 licensed sales associates, or 4.6% higher than a year ago.
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.11 per share is payable on June 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2005.
OUTLOOK
     As we think about the remainder of this year and beyond, we are enthusiastic about the opportunities for our operations in both the United States and Japan. The United States remains a significant market for our products. And we believe we can tap into that potential by further expansion of our distribution system and product line, and enhanced training of our sales force. We also believe we can maintain our strong position in Japan's insurance market. With Japan's aging population and higher out-of-pocket expenses, we are convinced that consumers will increasingly turn to affordable products that provide "living" benefits. Aflac Japan is the market leader for living-benefit products, and we believe we will maintain our number one position.
 
 
     We are also optimistic about achieving our financial objectives. Our goal for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding foreign currency translation. For 2006 our goal is to again produce 15% growth in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. We believe these financial objectives reasonably reflect the market opportunities we see, as well as our expectation for continued margin expansion for Aflac Japan.
Based on the strength of our first quarter earnings, we believe we will have the opportunity to increase our sales promotion activities for the remainder of 2005 and still achieve our earnings objective for the year.

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - May 23, 2005 - Aflac Incorporated today affirmed its earnings targets for 2005 and 2006. The company also set an earnings objective for 2007.
Aflac's earnings objective for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. Aflac's objective for 2006 is also to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. These objectives are unchanged from prior disclosures. The company's newly disclosed objective for 2007 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 13% to 16%, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation.
Commenting on the company's objectives and outlook, Aflac Incorporated Chairman and CEO Daniel P. Amos said: "Although our business model is simple and straightforward, our earnings targets reflect complex modeling and extensive analysis of our business. We believe the assumptions we have used in affirming and setting our earnings targets are reasonable. These earnings objectives reflect our expectations for continued margin expansion and the opportunities we see in the U.S. and Japanese markets, both of which we continue to view as well-suited to Aflac's products."

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
     Aflac Incorporated is providing its press release dated July 26, 2005 in which it reported its second quarter results and also its Second Quarter Report to Shareholders herein as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2.      In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information included or incorporated in this report (including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2) shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be set forth by specific reference in such filing.
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
EXHIBIT INDEX:
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - July 26, 2005 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its second quarter results. Total revenues were up 10.3% to $3.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a slightly stronger yen/dollar exchange rate than a year ago. Net earnings were $336 million, or $.66 per diluted share, compared with $258 million, or $.50 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2005 included realized investment gains of $7 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter also included a gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, resulting from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the second quarter of 2004, the impact from SFAS 133 lowered net earnings by $23 million, or $.04 per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $326 million, compared with $284 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 16.4% to $.64 per diluted share, compared with $.55 per share in the second quarter of 2004. Excluding the benefit of $.01 per share from the stronger yen to the dollar, operating earnings per share increased 14.5% for the quarter.
For the six months of 2005, total revenues rose 9.4% to $7.1 billion. Net earnings were $664 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared with $563 million, or $1.09 per share, for the first six months of 2004. Operating earnings for the six months were $661 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared with $569 million, or $1.10 per share, in 2004.
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.11 per share is payable on September 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2005.
Commenting on the company's second quarter and first-half results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are pleased with Aflac's financial performance during the first half of 2005. Both Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan have produced solid growth this year, and we believe each operation is on track to achieve its financial targets for the year.
"Aflac U.S. produced strong sales growth in the second quarter, with total new annualized premium sales rising 9.2% to $307 million. Several products contributed to our solid results. Once again our accident/disability product line was the largest sales contributor, accounting for approximately 53% of second quarter sales. Other products, including hospital indemnity and dental also sold well. For the first half of the year, total new sales were up 3.5% to $593 million. Our goal for the full year is a 3% to 8% increase in total new annualized premium sales.
"Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales were consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Total new sales rose 1.2% to 32.6 billion yen, or $302 million. As we expected, sales growth in the quarter was restrained by significant declines in Rider MAX sales and conversions. However, sales of our supplemental medical products were very strong, increasing 29.4% over last year. Sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life dramatically improved, rising 19.2% over the second quarter of 2004. For the first six months, total new annualized premium sales were up 3.1% to 62.4 billion yen, or $587 million. Our objective is to increase total new annualized premium sales in yen by 5% to 10% for the full year.
"We were encouraged to see Aflac U.S. make significant strides in reestablishing better sales growth during the second quarter. We believe our stronger sales and more effective recruiting reflect the efforts of our enhanced sales management infrastructure. We were also pleased with the continued strength of our medical product line in Japan and our number one position in the market for supplemental medical insurance. In addition, both Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan produced financial results that were consistent with our expectations. As such, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our principal financial target for 2005 of a 15% increase in operating earnings per share before the impact of currency translation.
"For 2006, our goal is also to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding the impact of the yen. And in May we established a 2007 objective of a 13% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the effect of currency. We believe our business is fundamentally strong, and we view our financial objectives as a reflection of the opportunities we see for our operations in the United States and Japan."

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 14.5% for the second quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation (including the effect of the yen, operating earnings per share were up 16.4%).
We purchased 2.6 million shares of Aflac's common stock in the second quarter.
In May we established a 2007 operating earnings per share target of a 13% to 16% increase before the effect of currency translation.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     We are pleased with Aflac's financial performance during the first half of 2005. Both Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan have produced solid growth this year, and we believe each operation is on track to achieve its financial targets for the year. We also believe we are well-positioned to achieve our primary financial objective for 2005 of a 15% increase in operating earnings per share before the impact of currency translation.
SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
     Total revenues were up 10.3% to $3.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a slightly stronger yen/dollar exchange rate than a year ago. Net earnings were $336 million, or $.66 per diluted share, compared with $258 million, or $.50 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2005 included realized investment gains of $7 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter also included a gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, resulting from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the second quarter of 2004, the impact from SFAS 133 lowered net earnings by $23 million, or $.04 per diluted share.
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating to net earnings appears on Page 6.
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart on Page 4 compares selected income s tatement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of those changes.
 
     Operating earnings in the second quarter of 2005 were $326 million, compared with $284 million in the second quarter of 2004. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 16.4% to $.64, compared with $.55 in the second quarter of 2004. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate added $.01 to per-share operating earnings during the quarter. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share increased 14.5%.
     During the second quarter, we acquired 2.6 million shares of Aflac's common stock. As of June 30, 2005, we had approximately 21 million shares available for purchase under current repurchase authorizations from the board of directors.
SIX MONTH RESULTS
     Also reflecting a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, total revenues advanced 9.4% to $7.1 billion in the first six months of 2005. Net earnings were $664 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared with $563 million, or $1.09 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first half of 2005 included realized investment gains of $9 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment gains of $3 million, or nil per share, a year ago. Net earnings also included a loss of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the impact of SFAS 133, compared with a loss of $12 million, or $.02 per share for the first half of 2004. In addition, net earnings in 2004 reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain Aflac Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government.
     Operating earnings for the six months were $661 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, compared with $569 million, or $1.10 per share in 2004. The stronger yen benefited operating earnings by $.02 per share in the first half of the year. Excluding the effect of currency changes, operating earnings per diluted share rose 16.4%, which is above our annual objective for earnings growth.
AFLAC JAPAN
     Aflac Japan's premium income in yen increased 6.6% in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 5.0%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because 30% of Aflac Japan's investment income is dollar-denominated. Total revenues increased 6.5% in the quarter. As a part of an information technology strategy, we have identified ways to improve and simplify our computing infrastructure, including for example, consolidation of processing from two mainframe systems to one. As a result, we determined it was appropriate to write off 2 billion yen, or $18 million before taxes, of costs related to software that will no longer be used. However, due to the continued favorable development of the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 14.0% to 14.7%. As a result, pretax operating earnings increased 11.9% in the second quarter. For the six months, premium income in yen increased 6.5%, and net invest ment income rose 5.7%. Total revenues were up 6.5% and pretax operating earnings grew 13.2%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 107.63 in the second quarter was 2.0% stronger than the average rate of 109.73 in the second quarter of 2004. For the six months, the average exchange rate was 106.04, or 2.3% stronger than the rate of 108.52 a year ago. The stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate in both the second quarter and the first six months of the year magnified the growth rates of Aflac Japan as reported in dollars.
     Benefiting from the stronger yen, premium income in dollars increased 8.6% to $2.2 billion in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 7.0% to $412 million. Total revenues rose 8.5% to $2.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $387 million, an increase of 14.1% from a year ago. For the six months, premium income rose 8.9% to $4.5 billion. Net investment income was up 8.1% to $822 million. Total revenues increased 8.9% to $5.3 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $787 million, or 15.9% higher than a year ago.
 
     Investment yields in Japan declined slightly in the second quarter from levels in the first three months of the year. For example, the yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 1.93% in the second quarter, compared with 2.03% in first quarter of 2005. During the second quarter, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 2.70%. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new money yield for the quarter was 2.85%. As of July 22, 2005, we had invested, or committed to invest, approximately 74% of our expected 2005 cash flow at an average yield of 3.03%.
     Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales were consistent with our expectations for the quarter. Total new sales rose 1.2% to 32.6 billion yen, or $302 million. As we expected, sales growth in the quarter was restrained by significant declines in Rider MAX sales and conversions. However, sales of our supplemental medical products were very strong, increasing 29.4% over last year. Sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life dramatically improved, rising 19.2% over the second quarter of 2004. For the first six months, total new annualized premium sales were up 3.1% to 62.4 billion yen, or $587 million. Our objective is to increase total new annualized premium sales in yen by 5% to 10% for the full year.
AFLAC U.S.
     Aflac U.S. premium income increased 10.6% to $803 million in the second quarter. Net investment income rose 6.2% to $104 million. Total revenues were $910 million, an increase of 10.0%. Pretax operating earnings rose 8.3% to $130 million. For the first six months, premium income rose 10.7% to $1.6 billion. Net investment income increased 5.7% to $206 million. Total revenues were up 10.1% to $1.8 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 9.0% to $263 million.
     Aflac U.S. produced strong sales growth in the second quarter, with total new annualized premium sales rising 9.2% to $307 million. Several products contributed to our solid results. Once again our accident/disability product line was the largest sales contributor, accounting for approximately 53% of second quarter sales. Other products, including hospital indemnity and dental also sold well. For the first half of the year, total new sales were up 3.5% to $593 million. Our goal for the full year is a 3% to 8% increase in total new annualized premium sales.
     Recruitment of new sales associates also remained strong. We recruited more than 6,700 new associates in the second quarter, an increase of 11.5% over 2004. We believe the improvement in new agent recruitment reflects our expanded sales management infrastructure. At the end of the quarter, more than 61,000 licensed sales associates represented Aflac U.S., which was 4.5% higher than a year ago.
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.11 per share is payable on September 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2005.
OUTLOOK
     We were encouraged to see Aflac U.S. make significant strides in reestablishing better sales growth during the second quarter. We believe our stronger sales and more effective recruiting reflect the efforts of our enhanced sales management infrastructure. We were also pleased with the continued strength of our medical product line in Japan and our number one position in the market for supplemental medical insurance. In addition, both Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan produced financial results that were consistent with our expectations. As such, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our principal financial target for 2005 of a 15% increase in operating earnings per share before the impact of currency translation.
 
     For 2006, our goal is also to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding the impact of the yen. And in May we established a 2007 objective of a 13% to 16% increase in operating earnings per share before the effect of currency. We believe our business is fundamentally strong, and we view our financial objectives as a reflection of the opportunities we see for our operations in the United States and Japan.

     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information included or incorporated in this report (including Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2) shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be set forth by specific reference in such filing.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
EXHIBIT INDEX:
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - October 24, 2005 - Aflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL) today reported its third quarter results.
Total revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter, or 10.5% higher than a year ago. Net earnings were $455 million, or $.90 per diluted share, compared with $293 million, or $.57 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2005 included realized investment gains of $89 million, or $.18 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. The significant realized investment gains in the quarter resulted from the execution of bond swaps that were designed to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards and improve investment income in future periods. In addition, net earnings in the third quarter included a loss of $1 million, or $.01 per diluted share, resulting from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the third quarter of 2004, the impact from SFAS 133 increased net earnings by $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share. Ne t earnings in the third quarter of 2005 benefited by $34 million, or $.07 per diluted share, from the release of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $333 million, compared with $292 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 15.8% to $.66 per diluted share, compared with $.57 per share in the third quarter of 2004. Although the yen was slightly weaker to the dollar compared with the third quarter of 2004, the impact of foreign currency translation on a per-share basis was not material in the quarter.
For the first nine months of 2005, total revenues rose 9.8% to $10.8 billion. Net earnings were $1.1 billion, or $2.20 per diluted share, compared with $856 million, or $1.65 per share, a year ago. Operating earnings were $994 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared with $860 million, or $1.66 per share, in 2004. Although the yen weakened to the dollar in the third quarter, the yen was slightly stronger than a year ago for the nine months. Excluding the benefit of $.02 per diluted share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 16.9% for the first nine months of 2005, which is ahead of our annual target of a 15% increase before the effect of the yen.
The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend of $.11 per share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2005.
Commenting on the company's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are very pleased with our financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005.
"Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the third quarter increased 8.2% from a year ago to 31.0 billion yen, or $278 million. We were pleased that our rate of sales growth improved significantly over the second quarter. For the first nine months of 2005, total new annualized premium sales were up 4.7% to 93.4 billion yen, or $865 million. As expected, sales growth was restrained by continued sharp declines in Rider MAX sales. However, we again produced significant increases in the sale of our medical products. Sales of our popular EVER products rose 31.7% in the quarter and accounted for 38% of Aflac Japan's total new sales. Dai-ichi Mutual Life's sales of our cancer life product were also very strong, rising 19.0% over the third quarter of 2004. Our objective for the full year is to increase total new annualized premium sales 5% to 10%.
"Aflac U.S. produced strong sales results in the third quarter. For the first nine months of the year, total new sales were up 5.6% to $890 million. Our goal for the full year remains a 3% to 8% increase in total new annualized premium sales. Recruitment of new sales associates slowed compared with the first half of the year. We recruited more than 5,700 new associates during the third quarter, which was 2.5% higher than a year ago. We believe recruitment in the quarter was impacted in part by the rollouts of our new vision and hospital indemnity products and the introduct ion of new training programs. However, new agent recruitment through the first nine months of the year rose 8.2%, which is consistent with our expectation of a 5% to 10% increase for the year.
Although Hurricanes Katrina and Rita held back sales growth during September, total new annualized premium sales still rose 10.0% to $297 million in the third quarter. We were especially pleased with the initial market reception of Vision Now, our new vision product. We began rolling out this innovative new product in July, and third quarter sales were more than $8 million, which exceeded our expectations.
"Overall, Aflac's sales and financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 have been gratifying. We were especially pleased to see Aflac U.S. post strong sales, and we believe we are making steady progress at reestablishing better sales growth. To produce sustainable sales momentum, we will continue our intense focus on the distribution side of our business model. Through ongoing recruiting efforts and new and more effective training programs, we are striving to expand the number of producing sales associates, and therefore sales growth, in the future. We were also pleased with Aflac Japan's marketing strength. Despite an increased number of competing products in the market, Aflac Japan produced strong medical sales growth in the quarter and through the first nine months of the year. And in the process, Aflac has retained its leading position as the number one seller of supplemental medical insurance policies in Japan.
"As we look to the balance of the year and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about growth opportunities for Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan. We believe aging populations and increased out-of-pocket expenses for consumers in both markets will continue to drive demand for our products. We also remain optimistic about achieving our financial goals. Our objective for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15% before the impact of foreign currency translation. Based on the strong results we have produced so far this year, we plan on increasing our sales promotion activities in the fourth quarter. However, we still expect to meet or exceed our earnings objective for the year. At the same time, we have retained our objectives of 15% growth in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of the yen for 2006, and 13% to 16% growth before currency fluctuations in 2007. When we established these financial objectives, we did so using what we considered to be reasonable assumptions. In ligh t of our current results and the overall strength of our operations, we still consider those assumptions to be reasonable, and we also believe our earnings objectives are achievable."

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
HIGHLIGHTS
Operating earnings per share on a diluted basis rose 15.8% for the third quarter, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation. (The impact of foreign currency translation on operating earnings per share growth was immaterial in the third quarter.)
We purchased 2.0 million shares of Aflac's common stock in the third quarter.
Aflac Japan was named the Life Insurance Company of the Year at the Asia Insurance Industry Awards, sponsored by the Asia Insurance Review.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     From a sales and financial perspective, Aflac produced another strong and rewarding quarter. Our insurance businesses in the United States and Japan each generated sales results that were in line with our targets for the third quarter of 2005. And our operations in both markets continued to produce strong financial results. As a result, operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation surpassed our expectations for the third quarter. Given our results for the first nine months of the year, we believe we are well-positioned to meet or exceed our full-year earnings objective for operating earnings per diluted share, excluding foreign currency translation.
THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
     Total revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter, or 10.5% higher than a year ago. Net earnings were $455 million, or $.90 per diluted share, compared with $293 million, or $.57 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2005 included realized investment gains of $89 million, or $.18 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. The significant realized investment gains in the quarter resulted from the execution of bond swaps that were designed to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards and improve investment income in future periods. In addition, net earnings in the third quarter included a loss of $1 million, or $.01 per diluted share, resulting from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the third quarter of 2004, the impact from SFAS 133 increased net earnings by $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2005 benefited by $34 million, or $.07 per diluted share, from the release of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating to net earnings appears on Page 6.
 
 
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart on Page 4 compares selected income s tatement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of those changes.
     Operating earnings in the third quarter were $333 million, compared with $292 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 15.8% to $.66 per diluted share, compared with $.57 per share in the third quarter of 2004. Although the yen was slightly weaker to the dollar compared with the third quarter of 2004, the impact of foreign currency translation on a per-share basis was not material in the quarter.
     During the third quarter, we purchased 2.0 million shares of Aflac's common stock. As of September 30, 2005, we had approximately 19 million shares available for purchase under the current authorization from the board of directors.
NINE MONTH RESULTS
     For the first nine months of 2005, total revenues rose 9.8% to $10.8 billion. Net earnings were $1.1 billion, or $2.20 per diluted share, compared with $856 million, or $1.65 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first nine months of the year included realized investment gains of $99 million, or $.19 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $1 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings also included a loss of $8 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the impact from SFAS 133, compared with a loss of $6 million, or $.01 per share, for the first nine months of 2004. In addition, net earnings benefited from the previously mentioned release of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Net earnings in the first nine months of 2004 reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the transfer of certain Aflac Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government.
     Operating earnings for the nine months were $994 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared with $860 million, or $1.66 per share, in 2004. Excluding the benefit of $.02 per diluted share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 16.9% for the first nine months of 2005, which is ahead of our annual target of a 15% increase before the effect of the yen.
AFLAC JAPAN
     Aflac Japan's premium income in yen increased 6.1% in the quarter. Net investment income rose 6.3%. Investment income growth in yen terms benefited modestly from the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 32% of Aflac Japan's investment income is dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 6.2%. The pretax operating profit margin expanded to 15.1%, compared with 14.0% a year ago, due to improvement in the benefit and expense ratios. As a result, pretax operating earnings climbed 14.5% in the third quarter. For the nine months, premium income in yen increased 6.4%, while net investment income rose 5.9%. Total revenues were up 6.4%, and pretax operating earnings grew 13.7%.
 
 
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 111.30 in the third quarter was 1.2% weaker than the average rate of 109.95 in the third quarter of 2004. For the nine months, however, the average exchange rate was 107.79 or 1.1% stronger than the rate of 109.00 a year ago. The weaker yen in the third quarter modestly suppressed Aflac Japan's reported results in dollars, while the stronger yen for the nine months enhanced Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms.
     Premium income in the third quarter increased 4.8% to $2.2 billion. Net investment income was up 5.0% to $410 million. Total revenues rose 5.0% to $2.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $392 million, an increase of 13.2% from a year ago. For the nine months, premium income rose 7.5% to $6.6 billion. Net investment income was up 7.1% to $1.2 billion. Total revenues were $7.9 billion, or 7.6% higher than a year ago. Pretax operating earnings were $1.2 billion, an increase of 15.0% over the first nine months of 2004.
     Japanese investment yields were lower than a year ago, although they were above second quarter levels. The yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 2.02% in the third quarter of 2005, compared with 2.24% a year ago and 1.93% in the second quarter of 2005. During the third quarter, we purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 3.15%. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new-money yield for the quarter was 3.43%.
     Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the third quarter increased 8.2% from a year ago to 31.0 billion yen, or $278 million. We were pleased that our rate of sales growth improved significantly over the second quarter. For the first nine months of 2005, total new annualized premium sales were up 4.7% to 93.4 billion yen, or $865 million. As expected, sales growth was restrained by continued sharp declines in Rider MAX sales. However, we again produced significant increases in the sale of our medical products. Sales of our popular EVER products rose 31.7% in the quarter and accounted for 38% of Aflac Japan's total new sales. Dai-ichi Mutual Life's sales of our cancer life product were also very strong, rising 19.0% over the third quarter of 2004. Our objective for the full year is to increase total new annualized premium sales 5% to 10%.
AFLAC U.S.
     Aflac U.S. premium income increased 10.1% to $820 million in the third quarter. Net investment income rose 7.4% to $107 million. Total revenues were up 9.7% to $929 million, while pretax operating earnings increased 5.1% to $133 million. For the nine months, premium income rose 10.5% to $2.4 billion, and net investment income was up 6.2% to $313 million. Total revenues increased 9.9% to $2.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 7.6% to $396 million.
     Aflac U.S. produced strong sales results in the third quarter. Although Hurricanes Katrina and Rita held back sales growth during September, total new annualized premium sales still rose 10.0% to $297 million in the third quarter. We were especially pleased with the initial market reception of Vision Now, our new vision product. We began rolling out this innovative new product in July, and third quarter sales were more than $8 million, which exceeded our expectations. For the first nine months of the year, total new sales were up 5.6% to $890 million. Our goal for the full year remains a 3% to 8% increase in total new annualized premium sales.
     Recruitment of new sales associates slowed compared with the first half of the year. We recruited more than 5,700 new associates during the third quarter, which was 2.5% higher than a year ago. We believe recruitment in the quarter was impacted in part by the rollouts of our new vision and hospital indemnity products and the introduction of new training programs. However, new agent recruitment through the first nine months of the year rose 8.2%, which is consistent with our expectation of a 5% to 10% increase for the year.
 
DIVIDEND
     The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend of $.11 per share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2005, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2005.
OUTLOOK
     Overall, Aflac's sales and financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2005 have been gratifying. We were especially pleased to see Aflac U.S. post strong sales, and we believe we are making steady progress at reestablishing better sales growth. To produce sustainable sales momentum, we will continue our intense focus on the distribution side of our business model. Through ongoing recruiting efforts and new and more effective training programs, we are striving to expand the number of producing sales associates, and therefore sales growth, in the future. We were also pleased with Aflac Japan's marketing strength. Despite an increased number of competing products in the market, Aflac Japan produced strong medical sales growth in the quarter and through the first nine months of the year. And in the process, Aflac has retained its leading position as the number one seller of supplemental medical insurance policies in Japan.
     As we look to the balance of the year and beyond, we remain enthusiastic about growth opportunities for Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan. We believe aging populations and increased out-of-pocket expenses for consumers in both markets will continue to drive demand for our products. We also remain optimistic about achieving our financial goals. Our objective for 2005 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15% before the impact of foreign currency translation. Based on the strong results we have produced so far this year, we plan on increasing our sales promotion activities in the fourth quarter. However, we still expect to meet or exceed our earnings objective for the year. At the same time, we have retained our objectives of 15% growth in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of the yen for 2006, and 13% to 16% growth before currency fluctuations in 2007. When we established these financial objectives, we did so using what we considered to be rea sonable assumptions. In light of our current results and the overall strength of our operations, we still consider those assumptions to be reasonable, and we also believe our earnings objectives are achievable.

EXHIBIT INDEX:
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - January 30, 2006 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Total revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005, or 3.5% higher than the fourth quarter of 2004. Net earnings were $364 million, or $.72 per diluted share, compared with $410 million, or $.80 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 included realized investment gains of $68 million, or $.14 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $4 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. The significant realized investment gains in the quarter resulted from the bond-swap program we initiated in the third quarter. In addition, net earnings in the fourth quarter included a loss of $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share, resulting from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $7 million, or $.01 per share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 benefited by $128 million , or $.25 per diluted share, from a release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $298 million, compared with $293 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 3.5% to $.59 per diluted share, compared with $.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2004. Operating earnings reflected an after-tax charge of $18 million, or $.03 per diluted share, for writing off the remaining portion of previously capitalized system development costs in Japan. In addition, the significantly weaker yen/dollar exchange rate compared with a year ago reduced operating earnings per share by $.03 in the quarter.
For the year, total revenues rose 8.1% to $14.4 billion in 2005. Net earnings were $1.5 billion, or $2.92 per diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $2.45 per share, a year ago. Operating earnings were $1.3 billion, or $2.54 per diluted share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $2.23 per share, in 2004. Excluding the negative impact of $.02 per share from the weaker yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.8% to $2.56, which was our objective for the year.
Pending approval by the board of directors, Aflac will increase its quarterly cash dividend 18.2% from $.11 per share to $.13 per share. At its meeting on February 14, 2006, the board of directors will consider the dividend increase, which would take effect in the first quarter of 2006. If approved, the first quarter dividend will be payable on March 1, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2006, and will mark the 24 consecutive year in which the dividend has been increased.
th
Commenting on the company's results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "The final quarter of 2005 concluded another record year for Aflac. The sales and financial results for Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan were in line with our expectations. In fact, the continued financial strength of our operations allowed us to significantly increase our advertising expenditures in both markets during the fourth quarter. More importantly, we still achieved our earnings growth objective for the year. And we are especially proud that 2005 marked the 16 consecutive year in which we have met or exceeded our target for earnings-per-share growth.
th
"Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter increased 6.1% from a year ago to 35.4 billion yen, or $302 million. For the year, total new annualized premium sales were up 5.1% to 128.8 billion yen, or $1.2 billion, which was in line with our objective for the year. We again produced strong growth from our stand-alone medical products. Sales from our EVER product line rose 19.6% over the fourth quarter of 2004 and accounted for 34% of total new sales. Dai-ichi Mutual Life posted strong results, with a sales increase of 31.2% over the fourth quarter of 2004. However, as expected, fourth quarter results also reflected sharp declines in Rider MAX sales. For 2006, we anticipate lower Rider MAX sales and weaker conversions will continue to restrain sales growth. Nevertheless, we expect to generate solid sales growth from our medical products. As a result, we believe sales will increase 5% to 8% in 2006.
"We continued to be pleased with the sales results of Aflac U.S. Total new annualized premium sales rose 7.5% to a record $369 million in the fourth quarter. Our accident/disability and cancer expense products remained the primary contributors to sales, accounting for a combined 70% of total sales in the quarter. We were also pleased with the sales of our most recent product introduction, Vision Now. This unique product, which was launched in July, provides both vision correction and general eye health benefits. Sales from Vision Now were $9 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, total new sales were up 6.1% to $1.3 billion, which was in line with our annual target of a 3% to 8% increase. Our objective for 2006 is to increase total new sales 8% to 12%.
"We were also pleased with the growth of our U.S. sales force in the quarter. We recruited more than 5,200 new sales associates during the fourth quarter, or 7.5% higher than a year ago. For the full year, new agent recruitment rose 8.0%, which was consistent with our expectation of a 5% to 10% increase for 2005. We also continued our emphasis on training in order to improve producing agent growth. By the end of the year, we had introduced our new Coordinator in Training program to 64 of our 95 state sales organizations.
"We remain enthusiastic about the opportunities we see for continued growth in the United States and Japan. We believe both markets are well-suited to our products and distribution systems. Furthermore, record sales results in the United States in 2005 reinforce our belief that we have been taking the appropriate steps to improve our sales growth. To that end, we will continue to focus on the distribution side of our business model to help us achieve our sales objectives and improve our operation in the long term. Despite a more competitive marketplace in Japan, we believe Aflac continues to stand out in terms of product value. And we also believe our successful product launches in Japan last year and the strong sales from our core medical product line exemplify our leading market position.
"In addition to positioning Aflac for future growth, we also spent considerable time over the last year assessing our practice of disclosing earnings targets. As we suggested at our analyst meeting last May, our primary concern is to balance our desire to provide earnings guidance with the potential risks of doing so. After giving consideration to the current legal and regulatory environment, we have determined we will provide earnings guidance for 1 1/2 years rather than the 2 1/2-year projections we had previously provided. We are not taking this action because our business has become less predictable. To the contrary; the business attributes that have enabled us to accurately assess our future earnings potential remain intact today. However, given the potential risks to our company and shareholders, we believe it is not prudent to provide longer-term projections.
"We have retained our objective for increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15% to $2.92 before the impact of foreign currency translation in 2006. In May 2005, we established a 2007 objective of a 13% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the effect of currency. Based on the development of our business since that time, we now believe it is reasonable to produce a 15% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share in 2007 before currency fluctuations. We believe our financial modeling is sound and our modeling assumptions reasonable. And we believe that achieving our targets will be rewarding to our shareholders."

EXHIBIT 99.2
 
HIGHLIGHTS
We achieved our earnings objective for the year with a 14.8% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the effect of foreign currency translation.
We purchased 2.4 million shares of Aflac's common stock in the fourth quarter.
We upwardly revised our 2007 objective to a 15% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before currency translation.
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
     The final quarter of 2005 concluded another record year for Aflac. The sales and financial results for Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan were in line with our expectations. In fact, the continued financial strength of our operations allowed us to significantly increase our advertising expenditures in both markets during the fourth quarter. More importantly, we still achieved our earnings growth objective for the year. And we are especially proud that 2005 marked the 16th consecutive year in which we have met or exceeded our target for earnings-per-share growth.
FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
     Total revenues were $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005, or 3.5% higher than the fourth quarter of 2004. Net earnings were $364 million, or $.72 per diluted share, compared with $410 million, or $.80 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2005 included realized investment gains of $68 million, or $.14 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $4 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. The significant realized investment gains in the quarter resulted from the bond-swap program we initiated in the third quarter. In addition, net earnings in the fourth quarter included a loss of $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share, resulting from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the fourth quarter of 2004, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $7 million, or $.01 per share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 benefited by $128 million, or $.25 per diluted share, from a release of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets resulting from passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
     We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.
     Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations. A reconciliation of operating to net earnings appears on Page 6.
     Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings when translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of currency translation. The chart on Page 4 compares selected income statement items wi th and without currency changes to illustrate the effect of those changes.
 
     Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $298 million, compared with $293 million a year ago. On a per-share basis, operating earnings rose 3.5% to $.59 per diluted share, compared with $.57 per share in the fourth quarter of 2004. Operating earnings reflected an after-tax charge of $18 million, or $.03 per diluted share, for writing off the remaining portion of previously capitalized system development costs in Japan. In addition, the significantly weaker yen/dollar exchange rate compared with a year ago reduced operating earnings per share by $.03 in the quarter.
     During the fourth quarter, we purchased 2.4 million shares of Aflac's common stock, bringing the total number of shares purchased for the year to 10 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 17 million shares available for purchase under the current authorization from the board of directors.
FULL YEAR RESULTS
     For the full year, total revenues rose 8.1% to $14.4 billion. Net earnings were $1.5 billion, or $2.92 per diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $2.45 per share, a year ago. Net earnings in 2005 included realized investment gains of $167 million, or $.33 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $5 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. Net earnings also included a loss of $10 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from the impact from SFAS 133, compared with a loss of $13 million, or $.03 per share, in 2004. In addition, net earnings in 2005 included a benefit of $34 million, or $.07 per diluted share, from the release of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. Net earnings in 2004 benefited from the previously mentioned release of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $128 million, or $.25 per diluted share. Net earnings in 2004 also reflected a one-time gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, as a result of the tran sfer of certain Aflac Japan pension obligations to the Japanese government.
     Operating earnings for the twelve months were $1.3 billion, or $2.54 per diluted share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $2.23 per share, in 2004. Excluding the negative impact of $.02 per share resulting from the weaker yen, we achieved our objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 14.8% to $2.56.
AFLAC JAPAN
     Aflac Japan's premium income in yen rose 6.3% in the quarter. Net investment income was up 10.1%. Investment income growth in yen terms benefited from the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate in the quarter because approximately 36% of Aflac Japan's investment income is dollar-denominated. Total revenues increased 7.0%. Although Aflac Japan's benefit ratio continued to improve, the profit margin declined slightly due to increased advertising expenses and the previously mentioned write down of capitalized system development costs. As a result, pretax operating earnings rose 5.0% in the fourth quarter. For the year, premium income in yen increased 6.3%, while net investment income rose 7.0%. Total revenues were up 6.6%, and pretax operating earnings grew 11.5%.
     The average yen/dollar exchange rate of 117.21 in the fourth quarter was 9.3% weaker than the average rate of 106.26 in the fourth quarter of 2004. For the year, the average exchange rate was 109.88, or 1.5% weaker than the rate of 108.26 a year ago.
     The weaker yen suppressed Aflac Japan's reported results in dollar terms. Premium income in the fourth quarter declined 4.1% to $2.1 billion. Net investment income was down .7% to $404 million. Total revenues decreased 3.5% to $2.5 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $337 million, or 4.9% lower than a year ago. For the year, premium income rose 4.5% to $8.7 billion. Net investment income was up 5.0% to $1.6 billion. Total revenues were $10.4 billion, or 4.7% higher than a year ago. Pretax operating earnings were $1.5 billion, an increase of 9.9% over 2004.
 
     Japanese investment yields were slightly higher than yields in the third quarter. The yield of a composite index of 20-year Japanese government bonds averaged 2.07% in fourth quarter of 2005, compared with 2.02% in the third quarter of 2005. We purchased yen-denominated investments at an average yield of 3.17% during the fourth quarter. Including dollar-denominated securities, our new-money yield for the quarter was 3.45%.
     Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter increased 6.1% from a year ago to 35.4 billion yen, or $302 million. For the year, total new annualized premium sales were up 5.1% to 128.8 billion yen, or $1.2 billion, which was in line with our objective for the year. We again produced strong growth from our stand-alone medical products. Sales from our EVER product line rose 19.6% over the fourth quarter of 2004 and accounted for 34% of total new sales. Dai-ichi Mutual Life posted strong results, with a sales increase of 31.2% over the fourth quarter of 2004. However, as expected, fourth quarter results also reflected sharp declines in Rider MAX sales. For 2006, we anticipate lower Rider MAX sales and weaker conversions will continue to restrain sales growth. Nevertheless, we expect to generate solid sales growth from our medical products. As a result, we believe sales will increase 5% to 8% in 2006.
AFLAC U.S.
     Aflac U.S. premium income increased 10.8% to $835 million in the fourth quarter. Net investment income rose 7.1% to $108 million. Total revenues were $945 million, an increase of 10.3%, while pretax operating earnings were down .3% to $129 million. The modest decline in pretax operating earnings resulted from a 60.0% increase in advertising expenses in the quarter. For the year, premium income rose 10.6% to $3.2 billion, and net investment income was up 6.5% to $421 million. Total revenues increased 10.0% to $3.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 5.6% to $525 million.
     We continued to be pleased with the sales results of Aflac U.S. Total new annualized premium sales rose 7.5% to a record $369 million in the fourth quarter. Our accident/disability and cancer expense products remained the primary contributors to sales, accounting for a combined 70% of total sales in the quarter. We were also pleased with the sales of our most recent product introduction, Vision Now. This unique product, which was launched in July, provides both vision correction and general eye health benefits. Sales from Vision Now were $9 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, total new sales were up 6.1% to $1.3 billion, which was in line with our annual target of a 3% to 8% increase. Our objective for 2006 is to increase total new sales 8% to 12%.
     We were also pleased with the growth of our U.S. sales force in the quarter. We recruited more than 5,200 new sales associates during the fourth quarter, or 7.5% higher than a year ago. For the full year, new agent recruitment rose 8.0%, which was consistent with our expectation of a 5% to 10% increase for 2005. We also continued our emphasis on training in order to improve producing agent growth. By the end of the year, we had introduced our new Coordinator in Training program to 64 of our 95 state sales organizations.
DIVIDEND
     Pending approval by the board of directors, Aflac will increase its quarterly cash dividend 18.2% from $.11 per share to $.13 per share. At its meeting on February 14, 2006, the board of directors will consider the dividend increase, which would take effect in the first quarter of 2006. If approved, the first quarter dividend will be payable on March 1, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 17, 2006, and will mark the 24th consecutive year in which the dividend has been increased.
OUTLOOK
     We remain enthusiastic about the opportunities we see for continued growth in the United States and Japan. We believe both markets are well-suited to our products and distribution systems. Furthermore, record sales results in the United States in 2005 reinforce our belief that we have been taking the appropriate steps to improve our sales growth. To that end, we will continue to focus on the distribution side of our business model to help us achieve our sales objectives and improve our operation in the long term. Despite a more competitive marketplace in Japan, we believe Aflac continues to stand out in terms of product value. And we also believe our successful product launches in Japan last year and the strong sales from our core medical product line exemplify our leading market position.
     In addition to positioning Aflac for future growth, we also spent considerable time over the last year assessing our practice of disclosing earnings targets. As we suggested at our analyst meeting last May, our primary concern is to balance our desire to provide earnings guidance with the potential risks of doing so. After giving consideration to the current legal and regulatory environment, we have determined we will provide earnings guidance for 1 1/2 years rather than the 2 1/2-year projections we had previously provided. We are not taking this action because our business has become less predictable. To the contrary; the business attributes that have enabled us to accurately assess our future earnings potential remain intact today. However, given the potential risks to our company and shareholders, we believe it is not prudent to provide longer-term projections.
     We have retained our objective for increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15% to $2.92 before the impact of foreign currency translation in 2006. In May 2005, we established a 2007 objective of a 13% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the effect of currency. Based on the development of our business since that time, we now believe it is reasonable to produce a 15% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share in 2007 before currency fluctuations. We believe our financial modeling is sound and our modeling assumptions reasonable. And we believe that achieving our targets will be rewarding to our shareholders.

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
     Aflac Incorporated is providing its press release dated April 25, 2006 in which it reported its first quarter results herein as Exhibit 99.1.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information included or incorporated in this report (Exhibit 99.1) shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be set forth by specific reference in such filing.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
 
 
EXHIBIT INDEX:

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - April 25, 2006 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
Reflecting a weaker yen to the dollar, total revenues were unchanged at $3.6 billion during the first quarter of 2006. Net earnings were $375 million, or $.74 per diluted share, compared with $328 million, or $.64 per share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment gains of $9 million, or $.02 per diluted share, compared with realized investment gains of $2 million, or nil per share, a year ago. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2006 also included a gain of $2 million, or nil per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the first quarter of 2005, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $9 million, or $.02 per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected incom e statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency translation.
Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2006 were $364 million, compared with $335 million in the first quarter of 2005. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 9.1% to $.72, compared with $.66 a year ago. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate lowered operating earnings per diluted share by $.04 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the weaker yen, operating earnings per share increased 15.2%.
During the first quarter, we acquired 2.1 million shares of Aflac stock. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 45 million shares available for repurchase under authorizations by the board of directors.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan continued to produce solid results that were in line with our expectations. Premium income in yen increased 6.2% in the first quarter of 2006 and net investment income rose 11.2%. Investment income growth in yen terms was magnified by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 37% of Aflac Japan's first quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues rose 6.9%. Due to improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 14.9% to 16.7%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen were up 19.2%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2006 was 116.90, compared with an average rate of 104.50 in the first quarter of 2005. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms were suppressed as a result of the 10.6% weakening of the average exchange rate during the quarter.
Reflecting the weaker yen, first quarter premium income in dollars declined 5.1% to $2.1 billion. Net investment income was down .6% to $408 million. Total revenues were $2.6 billion, a decrease of 4.4%. Pretax operating earnings were $425 million, or 6.6% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales declined 1.3% in the first quarter to 29.4 billion yen, or $251 million. As we discussed following our year-end earnings release, we expected weak first quarter sales. First quarter sales reflected continued declines of Rider MAX sales and conversions. We believe sales growth was also restrained by our agents' efforts to assist with the conversion of a group of existing customers from payroll to direct billing rates rather than concentrating on new sales. The billing conversion program is now complete. Cancer life sales benefited from the additional premium generated from billing mode conversions and sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life. Sales through Dai-ichi Life rose 5.1% in the first quarter. Medical sales declined in the quarter, which we believe resulted from the billing conversions as well as the introduction of WAYS, an innovative new life product. We were very pleased with the initial response to WAYS, which we launched in late January. Unli ke traditional life insurance, WAYS allows a policyholder to convert a portion of the life insurance coverage to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at retirement age. Despite its recent introduction, WAYS accounted for approximately 9% of first quarter sales. Our objective for the year is to increase total new annualized premium sales 5% to 8% in yen.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. produced solid financial results in the first quarter. Premium income increased 10.1% to $866 million. Net investment income rose 8.3% to $110 million. Total revenues were up 10.0% to $980 million. Pretax operating earnings were $147 million, an increase of 10.4%.
17,900. On an average weekly basis, the number of producing associates rose 4.9% to more than 10,100. For the second quarter, we face a tougher sales comparison and expect sales to be up in a range of mid- to upper-single digits, which would keep us on track for our sales goal for 2006. Our objective for the full year is an 8% to 12% increase in total new annualized premium sales.
We were pleased with our U.S. sales results in the first quarter. Total new annualized premium sales rose 11.4% to $318 million. Sales in the quarter were led by accident/disability and cancer expense insurance, which accounted for a combined 69% of sales in the quarter. We continued to be pleased with the sales of recently introduced products, particularly our revised hospital indemnity plan. Hospital indemnity sales were up 27.4% in the quarter, accounting for approximately 12% of sales. We were also encouraged to see continued expansion of our U.S. sales force. Newly recruited sales associates rose 4.2% over 2005, and the number of producing associates also increased. The number of average monthly producing associates increased 2.7% in the quarter to more than
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.13 per share is payable on June 1, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 19, 2006.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are pleased with Aflac's start in 2006. Our strong results were masked by the weaker yen compared with the first quarter of last year. However, in its local currency, Aflac Japan continued to post strong financial results, which were consistent with our expectations. At the same time, Aflac U.S. performed well in the quarter, achieving its sales and financial targets.
"Based on our first quarter results, we are optimistic about achieving our financial objectives for the year. Our primary financial goal for 2006 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding foreign currency translation. For 2007 our goal is to produce 15% to 16% growth in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. The yen may remain weak and suppress our reported financial performance, yet we believe Aflac is fundamentally very strong. We also believe we are well-positioned in the two largest insurance markets in the world."

ITEM 2.02  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     Aflac Incorporated is providing its press release dated July 25, 2006 in which it reported its second quarter results herein as Exhibit 99.1.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information included or incorporated in this report (Exhibit 99.1) shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be set forth by specific reference in such filing.
 
ITEM 9.01  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
EXHIBIT INDEX:

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia - July 25, 2006 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its second quarter results.
Reflecting a weaker yen to the dollar, total revenues were $3.7 billion during the second quarter of 2006, compared with $3.6 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $408 million, or $.81 per diluted share, compared with $336 million, or $.66 per share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment gains of $31 million, or $.06 per diluted share, compared with realized investment gains of $7 million, or $.01 per share, a year ago. The significant realized investment gains in the quarter resulted from the bond-swap program we initiated in the third quarter of 2005. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2006 also included a gain of $1 million, or nil per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the second quarter of 2005, the impact from SFAS 133 increased net earnings by $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected incom e statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency translation.
Operating earnings in the second quarter of 2006 were $376 million, compared with $326 million in the second quarter of 2005. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 17.2% to $.75, compared with $.64 a year ago. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate lowered operating earnings per diluted share by $.02 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the weaker yen, operating earnings per share increased 20.3%.
For the first six months of 2006, our results were also impacted by the weaker yen. Total revenues rose 1.8% to $7.3 billion, compared with $7.1 billion in the first half of 2005. Net earnings were $783 million, or $1.55 per diluted share, compared with $664 million, or $1.30 per share, for the first six months of 2005. Operating earnings for the six months were $740 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, compared with $661 million, or $1.30 per share, in 2005. Excluding the negative impact of $.06 per share from the weaker yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 17.7% for the first six months.
During the second quarter, we acquired 2.1 million shares of Aflac stock, bringing the total number of shares purchased in the first half of 2006 to 4.1 million. At the end of June, we had approximately 43 million shares available for repurchase under authorizations by the board of directors.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan produced solid financial results in the second quarter. Premium income in yen rose 6.2% and net investment income increased 9.0%. Investment income growth in yen terms was magnified by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 37% of Aflac Japan's second quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 6.5%. Due to improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 14.7% to 16.3%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 18.5%. For the six months, premium income in yen increased 6.2%, and net investment income rose 10.1%. Total revenues were up 6.7% and pretax operating earnings grew 18.9%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the second quarter of 2006 was 114.43, or 5.9% weaker than the average rate of 107.63 in the second quarter of 2005. For the six months, the average exchange rate was 115.65, or 8.3% weaker than the rate of 106.04 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for the second quarter and first six months were suppressed as a result of the weaker average exchange rates.
Reflecting the weaker yen, premium income in dollars declined .1% to $2.2 billion in the second quarter. Net investment income rose 2.6% to $422 million. Total revenues rose .2% to $2.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $432 million, or 11.5% higher than a year ago. For the six months, premium income was $4.4 billion, down 2.6% from a year ago. Net investment income was up 1.0% to $830 million. Total revenues declined 2.1% to $5.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $857 million, or 9.0% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales declined 4.2% in the second quarter to 31.2 billion yen, or $273 million. For the first six months, total new premium sales were down 2.8% to 60.6 billion yen, or $524 million. As we discussed at our May analyst meeting, sales in April were weaker than expected. However, sales recovered in May and were also up for the first three weeks of June. Unfortunately, sales for the last few days of June were especially weak. From a product perspective, the decline in second quarter sales primarily reflected weakness in the medical product category. Rider MAX sales and conversions were lower than a year ago, as were sales of our stand-alone medical products. Sales of the cancer life category were strong in the quarter, rising 14.2%, compared with the second quarter of 2005. Cancer life sales through Dai-ichi Mutual Life were down 3.2%. WAYS, the unique life insurance product we introduced in January, also sold well in the quarter. WAYS allows a policyholder to convert a portion of the life insurance coverage to medical, nursing care, or fixed annuity benefits at retirement age. WAYS sales were up 21.4% over the first quarter of 2006 and represented approximately 10% of second quarter sales.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. also produced a solid quarter. Premium income increased 9.3% to $878 million. Net investment income was up 10.0% to $115 million. Total revenues rose 9.2% to $994 million. Pretax operating earnings were $150 million, an increase of 15.1%.
For the first six months, premium income rose 9.7% to $1.7 billion. Net investment income increased 9.1% to $225 million. Total revenues were up 9.6% to $2.0 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 12.7% to $297 million.
Aflac U.S. sales results were consistent with our expectations for the second quarter. Total new annualized premium sales rose 6.3% to $327 million. For the six months, total new annualized premium sales increased 8.8% to $645 million. We again experienced solid growth from the hospital indemnity product line. Hospital indemnity sales were up 20.8% in the second quarter, accounting for approximately 13% of sales.
17,500. On an average weekly basis, the number of producing associates was up 2.7% to more than 9,900.
Our sales force continued to grow through June. We recruited approximately 6,800 new sales associates, which was .8% higher than the second quarter of 2005. The total number of licensed agents was up 5.8% over a year ago. The number of producing sales associates also increased. The number of average monthly producing associates rose 1.0% in the quarter to more than
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.13 per share is payable on September 1, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 18, 2006.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's second quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are very pleased with Aflac's financial performance for the first half of 2006. In terms of pretax operating earnings, both Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan surpassed our expectations. As a result, we exceeded our primary financial objective of increasing operating earnings per share by 15% before the impact of the yen. At the same time, we are encouraged that the sales activities of Aflac U.S. were in line with our expectations. We believe third quarter sales for Aflac U.S. will likely increase at a rate similar to our second quarter results. However, we expect to see stronger sales in the fourth quarter, which we believe will enable us to achieve our objective of an 8% to 12% sales increase for the year.
"Our sales in Japan, on the other hand, were disappointing. While Aflac Japan's sales decline in the first quarter was expected, the drop in second quarter sales was not. As I have stated previously, Japan's medical insurance market has become increasingly crowded with products that compete with Aflac's market-leading policies. Additionally, our preliminary research indicates medical sales for the entire industry were down for the first half of this year. Although we believe our coverage represents a superior value, it's becoming more difficult for us to attract customers who are policyholders of other companies. Given the current market environment, we believe Aflac Japan's sales will likely be flat to down single digits for the remainder of the year.
"Most importantly, we continue to believe our operations in Japan are well-positioned to achieve their financial targets for the year despite slower sales. Our persistency in Japan remains strong, and improved investment income growth has benefited our operations in Japan, as has continued improvement in our profit margin. We also expect Aflac U.S. to continue generating financial results that are in line with our objectives. As such, I am very confident that we will achieve our primary financial goal for 2006 of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 15%, excluding foreign currency translation. For 2007 our goal remains a 15% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. We believe our earnings goal for 2007 is achievable as well."

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  October 24, 2006  Aflac Incorporated today reported its third quarter results.
Reflecting a weaker yen to the dollar, total revenues were $3.7 billion during the third quarter of 2006, unchanged from a year ago.  Net earnings were $367 million, or $.73 per diluted share, compared with $455 million, or $.90 per share, a year ago.  The decline in net earnings primarily resulted from lower realized investment gains, which were $7 million, or $.01 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006, compared with $89 million, or $.18 per share, a year ago.  The significant realized investment gains in the third quarter of 2005 resulted from a bond-swap program, which we completed in the second quarter of 2006.  Net earnings in the third quarter of 2006 also included a loss of $3 million from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133.  In the third quarter of 2005, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $1 million.  In addition, net earnings in the third quarter of 2006 were lower than a year ago due to last year's benefit of $34 million, or $.07 per diluted share, from the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers.  We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.  Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars.  We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period.  However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars.  As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders.  Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.  The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency translation.
Operating earnings in the third quarter of 2006 were $363 million, compared with $333 million in the third quarter of 2005.  Operating earnings per diluted share rose 9.1% to $.72, compared with $.66 a year ago.  The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate lowered operating earnings per diluted share by $.02 during the quarter.  Excluding the impact from the weaker yen, operating earnings per share increased 12.1%.
For the first nine months of 2006, our results were also impacted by the weaker yen.  Total revenues rose 1.2% to $10.9 billion, compared with $10.8 billion in the first nine months of 2005.  Net earnings were $1.2
billion, or $2.29 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $2.20 per share, for the first nine months of 2005.  Operating earnings for the nine months were $1.1 billion, or $2.19 per diluted share, compared with $994 million, or $1.96 per share, in 2005.  Excluding the negative impact of $.08 per share from the weaker yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.8% for the first nine months.
During the third quarter, we acquired 3.0 million shares of Aflac stock, bringing the total number of shares purchased in the first nine months of 2006 to 7.1 million. At the end of September, we had approximately 40 million shares available for repurchase under authorizations by the board of directors.  In each of the last three years, we purchased approximately 10 million shares and we also expect to purchase about 10 million shares for the full year of 2006.  Due to Aflac's very strong capital position, we now anticipate purchasing approximately 12 million shares in 2007.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan produced solid financial results in the third quarter.  Premium income in yen rose 5.8%, and net investment income increased 9.6%.  Investment income growth in yen terms was magnified by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 37% of Aflac Japan's third quarter investment income was dollar-denominated.  Total revenues were up 6.4%.  Due to improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 15.1% to 15.4%.  As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 8.4%.  For the nine months, premium income in yen increased 6.0%, and net investment income rose 9.9%.  Total revenues were up 6.6%, and pretax operating earnings grew 15.3%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2006 was 116.17, or 4.2% weaker than the average rate of 111.30 in the third quarter of 2005.  For the nine months, the average exchange rate was 115.82, or 6.9% weaker than the rate of 107.79 a year ago.  Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the third quarter and first nine months were suppressed as a result of the weaker average exchange rates.
Reflecting the weaker yen, premium income in dollars was up 1.2% to $2.2 billion in the third quarter.  Net investment income rose 4.9% to $430 million.  Total revenues increased 1.9% to $2.6 billion.  Pretax operating earnings were $407 million, or 3.8% higher than a year ago.  For the nine months, premium income was $6.6 billion, down 1.4% from a year ago.  Net investment income was up 2.3% to $1.3 billion.  Total revenues declined .8% to $7.8 billion.  Pretax operating earnings were $1.3 billion, or 7.3% higher than a year ago.
As we mentioned in our second quarter earnings announcement, we had anticipated a decline in Aflac Japan's new sales for the third quarter.  Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales declined 11.9% to 27.3 billion yen, or $235 million in the third quarter.  For the nine months, total new annualized premium sales were down 5.8% to 87.9 billion yen, or $759 million.  Although stand-alone medical coverage remained our best-selling product category and we retained our number one market position, medical sales were weak in the quarter.  WAYS, the innovative life insurance product we introduced in January, continued to sell well.  However, given the challenging market in Japan, we continue to expect total new annualized premium sales to decline for the balance of the year in Japan.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. produced a strong quarter from both a financial and sales perspective.  Premium income increased 9.5% to $898 million.  Net investment income was up 12.1% to $120 million.  Total revenues rose 9.8% to $1.0 billion.  Pretax operating earnings were $162 million, an increase of 21.7%.  For the first nine months, premium income rose 9.6% to $2.6 billion.  Net investment income increased 10.2% to $345 million.  Total revenues were up 9.7% to $3.0 billion.  Pretax operating earnings rose 15.7% to $459 million.
Aflac U.S. sales results were strong in the third quarter.  Despite challenging comparisons to last year, total new annualized premium sales rose 11.7% to $332 million.  For the nine months, total new annualized premium sales increased 9.7% to $976 million.  We believe our sales results through September keep us solidly on track to achieve our full-year sales objective of an 8% to 12% increase.
We were also pleased with our sales force expansion in the quarter.  We recruited approximately 6,600 new sales associates, which was 13.5% higher than the third quarter of 2005.  The total number of licensed sales associates at the end of September rose 8.4% over a year ago.  More importantly, the number of producing sales associates also increased.  On an average weekly basis, the number of producing associates was up 7.6% to approximately 10,200 in the third quarter.
DIVIDEND
For the second time in 2006, the board of directors has approved an increase in the cash dividend.  The board increased the cash dividend 23.1%, effective with the fourth quarter payment.  The fourth quarter dividend of $.16 per share is payable on December 1, 2006, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2006.
The board of directors also approved an additional cash dividend increase, effective with the first quarter of 2007.  The first quarter cash dividend payment of $.185 per share, which is 15.6% higher than the fourth quarter payment of $.16 per share, is payable on March 1, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2007.  As a result of these actions by the board, the dividend in the first quarter of 2007 will be 42.3% higher than the dividend in the first quarter of 2006.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's third quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, I am very pleased with Aflac's financial performance during the third quarter and the first nine months of the year.  We continue to achieve our operational and financial goals, and I believe we are poised to conclude another great year.
"Aflac U.S. is operating at a level that is consistent with, or better than, our objectives.  We believe our strong sales this year demonstrate that we have taken the appropriate actions to enhance our distribution. At the same time, the operating trends of our U.S. operation remain very steady, with our benefit and expense ratios and profit margin all falling in line with our expectations.  Aflac Japan is also meeting its expectations from a financial perspective.  Although new sales have fallen short of our initial objective for the year, our top-line growth is still consistent with our targets. The persistency of our business in Japan remains outstanding.  In addition, the benefit ratio has continued to improve as we expected, which has resulted in better profitability.
"I remain very confident that we will achieve our primary financial goal for 2006 of increasing operating earnings 15% to $2.92 per diluted share, excluding foreign currency translation. Based on our year-to-date results, achieving that goal suggests $.65 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, before the impact of the yen. Assuming the yen averages 115 to 120 to the dollar for the remainder of the year, we would expect to report operating earnings of $.65 to $.66 per diluted share in the fourth quarter.  For 2007 our goal remains a 15% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen, which we believe is also reasonable and achievable.
"Our board's decision to increase the dividend a combined 42% by the end of the first quarter of 2007, while also increasing our share repurchase by approximately 20%, is a reflection of our continued confidence in our ability to achieve our primary financial targets. It is also consistent with our commitment to enhancing shareholder value.  I'm very proud of our track record of generating strong shareholder returns.  For the last one, five and 10 years, Aflac's total return has significantly exceeded the returns of the S&P 500. And we believe that achieving our earnings targets, increasing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares is an effective way to build on our record of success."

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  January 16, 2007  Aflac Incorporated today announced that effective February 1, 2007, Tohru Tonoike will assume the position of deputy president of Aflac Japan. He will report to Aki Kan, president and chief operating officer of Aflac Japan and chairman of Aflac International.
Prior to joining Aflac, Tonoike worked for Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank, which later merged with two other banks to form the Mizuho Financial Group. Since 2005 he has served as president and representative director of Dai-ichi Kangyo Asset Management Company, another division of the Mizuho Financial Group, where he will remain until February 1, 2007.
Tonoike has served on the Aflac board of directors since November 1, 2004.  He has submitted his resignation from the board of directors, effective January 31, 2007.  His seat on Aflac's board of directors will be filled by an independent director to be voted upon at Aflac's 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
In commenting on Tonoike's new role within Aflac's management, Aflac Japan President and Chief Operating Officer Aki Kan said: "We are thrilled Tonoike-san is joining our senior management team. As an authority in the banking industry and as a native expert on Japan's unique business culture, his experience will complement our organization extremely well. Because Aflac is a U.S.-based company operating in Japan, Tonoike's cultural knowledge, combined with his practical business know-how and experience, will help guide Aflac in identifying and capitalizing on the opportunities in Japan's insurance market."
Aflac Incorporated Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos added: "Through his service on the board of directors of Aflac Incorporated, Tonoike-san has developed a strong understanding of our company and our business needs and operations. Adding the scope of his expertise and knowledge to our senior management team will help Aflac Japan's operations overall as we address the unique challenges and opportunities we face in Japan."

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  January 30, 2007  Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Total revenues were $3.7 billion during the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $3.6 billion a year ago.  Net earnings were $332 million, or $.67 per diluted share, compared with $364 million, or $.72 per share, a year ago.  The decline in net earnings primarily resulted from lower realized investment gains, which were $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $68 million, or $.14 per share, a year ago.  The significant realized investment gains in the fourth quarter of 2005 resulted from a bond-swap program, which we completed in the second quarter of 2006.  The change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133, was immaterial in the fourth quarter of 2006.  In the fourth quarter of 2005, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $2 million, or $.01 per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers.  We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items.  Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars.  We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period.  However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars.  As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders.  Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.  The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency translation.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2006 were $329 million, compared with $298 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Operating earnings per diluted share rose 11.9% to $.66, which was consistent with our expectations as communicated in our third quarter earnings release, compared with $.59 per share a year ago.  The yen/dollar exchange rate did not impact operating earnings on a per-share basis for the fourth quarter.
For the full year of 2006, our results were impacted by a weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, compared with 2005.  Total revenues were $14.6 billion, an increase of 1.8% over 2005.  Net earnings were $1.5 billion, or $2.95 per diluted share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $2.92 per share, in 2005.  Like the fourth quarter, full-year net earnings were impacted by lower realized investment gains in 2006, compared with 2005.  Realized investment gains were $51 million in 2006, or $.10 per diluted share, compared with $167 million, or $.33 per share, in 2005.  The impact of SFAS 133 was immaterial for the full year of 2006, compared with a loss of $10 million, or $.02 per diluted share, in 2005.  Also affecting comparisons of net earnings was the inclusion in 2005 of a benefit of $34 million, or $.07 per diluted share, from the release of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
Operating earnings for the year were $1.4 billion, or $2.85 per diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $2.54 per share, in 2005.  Excluding the negative impact of $.08 per share from the weaker yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.4% for the year, which was slightly better than our objective.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired 3.1 million shares of our stock, bringing the total number of shares purchased in 2006 to 10.3 million. At the end of December, we had approximately 36.6 million shares available for repurchase under authorizations by the board of directors.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan produced strong financial results in the fourth quarter.  Premium income in yen rose 5.6%, and net investment income increased 6.5%.  Total revenues were up 5.5%.  Due to improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 13.4% to 14.7%.  As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 15.9%.  For the year, premium income in yen increased 5.9%, and net investment income rose 9.0%.  Investment income growth in yen terms was magnified for the year by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 37% of Aflac Japan's investment income was dollar-denominated.  Total revenues were up 6.3%, and pretax operating earnings grew 15.4%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2006 was 117.88, or .6% weaker than the average rate of 117.21 in the fourth quarter of 2005.  For the year, the average exchange rate was 116.31, or 5.5% weaker than the rate of 109.88 a year ago.
Premium income in dollars was up 5.1% to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter.  Net investment income rose 6.1% to $428 million.  Total revenues increased 5.1% to $2.6 billion.  Pretax operating earnings were $388 million, or 15.3% higher than a year ago.  For the year, Aflac Japan's results in dollar terms were suppressed by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate in 2006. Premium income was $8.8 billion, up .2% from a year ago.  Net investment income was up 3.2% to $1.7 billion.  Total revenues were up .6% to $10.5 billion.  Pretax operating earnings were $1.7 billion, or 9.1% higher than a year ago.
As we stated in our third quarter earnings announcement, we had anticipated a decline in Aflac Japan's new sales for the fourth quarter.  Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales declined 16.6% to 29.5 billion yen, or $251 million in the fourth quarter.  For the year, total new annualized premium sales were down 8.8% to 117.5 billion yen, or $1.0 billion.  The sales declines for the fourth quarter and the year primarily reflected industrywide weakness in the market for stand-alone medical insurance as well as continued declines in the sale of Rider MAX.  The ordinary life category continued to show solid sales gains, benefiting from the sale of WAYS, the innovative life insurance product we introduced in January 2006.  We continue to expect 2007 to be a challenging year from a sales perspective and look for sales to again decline in the first half of the year, followed by sales increases in the second half of 2007.
AFLAC U.S.
Throughout 2006, we were pleased with the performance of Aflac U.S. In the fourth quarter, premium income increased 9.0% to $910 million.  Net investment income was up 11.0% to $120 million.  Total revenues rose 9.3% to $1.0 billion.  During the fourth quarter, we increased Aflac U.S. claims reserves by $28.3 million, which reflected a lengthening of cancer treatment periods for claims incurred in 2006 and prior years.  As a result, the pretax profit margin declined from 13.6% a year ago to 12.2% and pretax operating earnings were down 1.8% to $126 million.  For the year, premium income rose 9.5% to $3.6 billion.  Net investment income increased 10.4% to $465 million.  Total revenues were up 9.5% to $4.0 billion.  Pretax operating earnings rose 11.4% to $585 million.
As we expected, Aflac U.S. total new annualized premium sales results were very strong in the fourth quarter.  Total new sales rose 21.2% to $447 million in the quarter.  These record sales results were due, in part, to the re-enrollment of a large payroll account.  However, even excluding the additional sales from that account, total new sales still grew at a strong double-digit rate in the fourth quarter.  For the year, total new annualized premium sales increased 13.1% to $1.4 billion, which exceeded our 2006 sales objective of an 8% to 12% increase.
We believe our strong sales continued to benefit from the expansion of our sales force.  The total number of licensed sales associates at the end of December was up 8.5% over a year ago to more than 68,300. The increase in licensed associates benefited from solid new agent recruitment in the year, including a very strong fourth quarter in which recruitment was up 15.1%. Most importantly, the number of producing sales associates also increased.  On an average weekly basis, the number of producing associates was up 10.3% to approximately 11,000 in the fourth quarter. We expect our sales momentum to continue into 2007.  We believe our 2007 sales objective of a 6% to 10% increase balances our enthusiasm for our U.S. business with the challenging comparisons that we face due to the very strong sales we produced in 2006.
DIVIDEND
As reported in October 2006, the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective with the first quarter of 2007.  The first quarter cash dividend of $.185 per share is 42.3% higher than the first quarter 2006 dividend of $.13 per share.  The first quarter dividend is payable on March 1, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2007, and will mark the 24
th
 consecutive year in which the dividend has been increased.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's fourth quarter and full-year results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "The fourth quarter of 2006 concluded another strong year for Aflac Incorporated from a financial perspective.  Both Aflac U.S. and Aflac Japan contributed to record operating earnings.  And we again achieved our primary financial goal, which was to increase operating earnings per diluted share in 2006 by 15% before the impact of currency translation.
"We were particularly happy with the continued momentum in our U.S. operation.  We believe the many actions we have taken in recent years to enhance our sales force infrastructure are paying off.  Our expanded distribution system and recent training initiatives have resulted in better growth of producing sales associates, which in turn has benefited our sales.  At the same time, the underlying operating trends at Aflac U.S. have been quite stable, and Aflac U.S. financial results were consistent with our expectations for the year.
"Aflac Japan produced a very strong fourth quarter from a financial standpoint, as it did in each quarter of last year.  Although we were disappointed with new sales, revenues were still in line with our expectations due to the strong persistency of our business and improved investment income growth.  The premium from new sales greatly exceeded lost premium from lapses.  As a result, our annualized premiums in force in yen still grew at a solid rate.  And as we expected, the benefit ratio continued to improve, which resulted in higher profit margins and rapid pretax earnings growth.
"As we look to 2007, our financial outlook has not changed.  Our objective for 2007 is to increase operating earnings 15% to 16% to $3.28 to $3.31 per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen.  We continue to believe that is an achievable objective for this year. We will be tirelessly working on improving our sales growth in Japan and maintaining our momentum in the United States.  And we believe we have the opportunity to see 2007 emerge as another record year for Aflac Incorporated."

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  April 24, 2007  Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
Total revenues were $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2007, compared with $3.6 billion in the first quarter of 2006. Net earnings were $416 million, or $.84 per diluted share, compared with $375 million, or $.74 per share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment gains of $9 million, or $.02 per diluted share, unchanged from a year ago. The impact on net earnings from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133, was immaterial in the first quarter of 2007. In the first quarter of 2006, the impact from SFAS 133 benefited net earnings by $2 million, or nil per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency translation.
Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2007 were $407 million, compared with $364 million in the first quarter of 2006. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 13.9% in the quarter to $.82, compared with $.72 a year ago. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate lowered operating earnings per diluted share by $.01 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the weaker yen, operating earnings per share increased 15.3%.
During the first quarter, we acquired 5.1 million shares of Aflac stock. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 32 million shares available for repurchase under authorizations by the board of directors.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's financial results in the first quarter were solid and consistent with our expectations. Premium income in yen increased 4.9% in the first quarter of 2007, and net investment income rose 9.2%. Investment income growth in yen terms was magnified by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately
 
39% of Aflac Japan's first quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues rose 5.7%. Due to improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 16.7% to 17.6%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen were up 11.8%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2007 was 119.48, compared with an average rate of 116.90 in the first quarter of 2006. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms were modestly suppressed as a result of the 2.2% weakening of the average exchange rate during the quarter.
Premium income in dollars was $2.2 billion in the first quarter, up 2.6% over a year ago. Net investment income rose 6.9% to $436 million. Total revenues were $2.6 billion, an increase of 3.4%. Pretax operating earnings increased 9.3% to $465 million.
As we had anticipated, Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales declined in the first quarter. Total new sales decreased 10.6% to 26.3 billion yen, or $221 million in the first quarter. Aflac Japan's sales continued to reflect weakness in the demand for supplemental medical insurance. We also experienced lower sales in the ordinary life category during the quarter as consumers awaited future declines in life insurance premium rates due to new mortality tables that took effect April 2, 2007. We were encouraged to see a double-digit increase in cancer insurance for the quarter. We continue to expect 2007 to be a challenging year from a sales perspective and believe sales will be lower in the second quarter, compared with a year ago. However, we remain optimistic that sales will recover with a modest increase in the second half of the year.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. performed very well in the first quarter. Premium income increased 10.9% to $961 million. Net investment income rose 10.3% to $122 million. Total revenues were up 10.7% to $1.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $169 million, an increase of 15.4% over the first quarter of 2006.
We were also pleased with the continued momentum of our U.S. sales. Total new annualized premium sales rose 10.6% to $352 million. Sales in the quarter were again led by accident/disability and cancer expense insurance. We remain very satisfied with our progress in the ongoing expansion of our U.S. sales force. Despite the anticipated decline in newly recruited sales associates, the number of average weekly producing sales associates, which we believe to be a more meaningful metric, increased 6.8% in the quarter. We believe the increase in producing sales associates reflects the success of the training programs we implemented over the last few years. We remain enthusiastic about the opportunities in the U.S. market, and continue to look for total new annualized premium sales to increase 6% to 10% for the full year.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors increased the quarterly dividend payment by 10.8%, effective with the second quarter. The second quarter cash dividend of $.205 per share is 57.7% higher than the second quarter of 2006, and is payable on June 1, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2007. This marks the third consecutive quarter of cash dividend increases, and 2007 marks the 25 consecutive year in which the dividend has been increased.
th
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, we are pleased with Aflac's results for the first quarter of 2007 and with our outlook for the remainder of the year.
"Although Japan remains a challenging market from a sales perspective, Aflac Japan's financial results continue to reflect the many attractive attributes of our business. Our persistency remained strong and despite a sales decline, Aflac Japan's annualized premiums in force still rose 4.8%. At the same time, our benefit ratio again improved, and our expense ratio remained stable, resulting in improved profitability.
 
"We remain excited about our prospects in the U.S. market, and we are very pleased with the momentum of Aflac U.S. The steady expansion of our base of producing sales associates remains the key to capitalizing on the opportunities in the vast U.S. market. We believe our commitment to training has resulted in a continued increase in the number of producing sales associates. We are also pleased with the stable operating trends of Aflac U.S., which have resulted in consistent growth of pretax earnings.
"Based on our first quarter results, we remain very optimistic about achieving our financial targets for the year. Our primary financial goal for 2007 is to produce 15% to 16% growth in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. We believe that goal reasonably reflects the challenges and opportunities we see in the two largest insurance markets in the world. And the board of directors' decision to increase the cash dividend again reflects our strong capital position and our commitment to increasing value to Aflac's shareholders."

EXHIBIT INDEX:

 
Aflac Incorporated 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  July 24, 2007  Aflac Incorporated today reported its second quarter results.
Reflecting a weaker yen to the dollar, total revenues were $3.8 billion during the second quarter of 2007, compared with $3.7 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $415 million, or $.84 per diluted share, compared with $408 million, or $.81 per share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment gains of $9 million, or $.02 per diluted share. Realized investment gains in the second quarter of 2006 of $31 million, or $.06 per share, reflected the completion of a bond-swap program that began in 2005. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2007 also included a loss of $1 million, or nil per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the second quarter of 2006, the impact from SFAS 133 increased net earnings by $1 million, or nil per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency translation.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $407 million, compared with $376 million in the second quarter of 2006. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 9.3% to $.82, compared with $.75 a year ago. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate lowered operating earnings per diluted share by $.02 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the weaker yen, operating earnings per share increased 12.0%.
Results for the first six months of 2007 were also impacted by the weaker yen. Total revenues rose 3.6% to $7.5 billion, compared with $7.3 billion in the first half of 2006. Net earnings were $831 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared with $783 million, or $1.55 per share, for the first six months of 2006. Operating earnings for the first six months of 2007 were $814 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, compared with $740 million, or $1.47 per share, in 2006. Excluding the negative impact of $.03 per share from the weaker yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 13.6% for the first six months.
 
During the second quarter, we acquired 2.0 million shares of Aflac stock, bringing the total number of shares purchased in the first half of 2007 to 7.1 million. At the end of June, we had 29.6 million shares available for repurchase under authorizations by the board of directors.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 4.3%, and net investment income increased 10.6% in the second quarter. Investment income growth in yen terms was magnified by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 40% of Aflac Japan's second quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 5.5%. Due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 16.3% to 17.4%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 12.6%. For the six months, premium income in yen increased 4.6%, and net investment income rose 9.9%. Total revenues were up 5.6% and pretax operating earnings grew 12.2%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the second quarter of 2007 was 120.78, or 5.3% weaker than the average rate of 114.43 in the second quarter of 2006. For the six months, the average exchange rate was 120.13, or 3.7% weaker than the rate of 115.65 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for the second quarter and first six months were suppressed as a result of the weaker average exchange rates.
Reflecting the weaker yen, premium income in dollars declined 1.1% to $2.2 billion in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 4.8% to $442 million. Total revenues were unchanged at $2.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings increased 6.7% to $461 million. For the six months, premium income was $4.4 billion, or .7% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 5.8% to $878 million. Total revenues were up 1.7% to $5.3 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $926 million, or 8.0% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan's sales results for both the second quarter and the first half of the year were better than we expected. Total new annualized premium sales declined 3.5% in the second quarter to 30.1 billion yen, or $249 million. For the first six months, total new premium sales were down 6.9% to 56.4 billion yen, or $470 million. Sales in the second quarter continued to reflect lower medical sales, compared with a year ago. However, we again experienced a significant increase in cancer insurance sales for the quarter, which rose 22.7% over the second quarter of 2006. In addition, ordinary life sales recovered somewhat from the first quarter of 2007. We remain encouraged about the prospects for improvement, and we continue to believe we will produce a modest sales increase in the second half of the year.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 10.7% to $972 million in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 8.4% to $124 million. Total revenues rose 10.6% to $1.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $171 million, an increase of 14.1%. For the first six months, premium income rose 10.8% to $1.9 billion. Net investment income increased 9.4% to $246 million. Total revenues were up 10.7% to $2.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 14.7% to $340 million.
We were again pleased with our sales results in the United States. Total new annualized premium sales rose 11.8% to $365 million in the second quarter. We experienced strong sales of our leading accident/disability product line as well as our hospital indemnity category. For the six months, total new annualized premium sales increased 11.2% to $717 million.
Despite a slight decline in newly recruited sales associates in the second quarter, the 6.7% increase in average weekly producing sales associates demonstrates that our training philosophies and programs are working. Focusing on average weekly producing associates provides a more meaningful measure of our recruiting success, and our increase in this area shows that we're recruiting better and smarter. We believe our sales results for the first half of the year keep us firmly on track to achieve our full-year sales objective of a 6% to 10% increase.
 
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.205 per share is payable on September 4, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2007.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's second quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are very pleased with Aflac's performance for the first half of 2007. From both a sales and financial perspective, our operations in Japan and the United States have met or exceeded our expectations so far this year.
"Aflac Japan has produced solid top-line growth in 2007, which has benefited from strong persistency and investment income. At the same time, our profit margin has continued to expand as we expected, which resulted in strong pretax earnings growth. While Japan is still a challenging market, we believe we are positioned to see a modest sales increase in the second half of the year. Aflac Japan recently announced that on August 1, we will introduce Gentle EVER, a new stand-alone medical product, which we believe will benefit our sales results in the third and fourth quarters.
"Aflac U.S. has also produced financial results that reflect strong underlying fundamentals that are consistent with our expectations. We believe the United States remains a very large and attractive market for the sale of our products. And we are also convinced that our emphasis on increasing the number of producing sales associates is an important factor in our improved sales momentum.
"I remain confident that we will achieve our primary financial goal for 2007 of increasing operating earnings per diluted share by 15% to 16%, or $3.28 to $3.31, excluding foreign currency translation. Assuming the yen averages 120 to 125 to the dollar for the remainder of the year, we would expect to report operating earnings of $3.21 to $3.24 per diluted share for the full year. In light of the weak yen to the dollar, we expect third quarter operating earnings will be in the range of $.80 to $.82 per diluted share. Reflecting the strength of our operations, I also believe our 2008 goal of a 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen, is a reasonable and achievable target."

EXHIBIT INDEX:

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  October 23, 2007  Aflac Incorporated today reported its third quarter results.
Reflecting a weaker yen to the dollar, total revenues rose 5.1% to $3.9 billion during the third quarter of 2007, compared with $3.7 billion in the third quarter of 2006. Net earnings were $420 million, or $.85 per diluted share, compared with $367 million, or $.73 per share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment gains of $1 million, or nil per diluted share, compared with $7 million, or $.01 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006. Net earnings in the third quarter of 2007 also included a gain of $2 million, or nil per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the third quarter of 2006, the impact from SFAS 133 reduced net earnings by $3 million, or nil per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency translation.
Operating earnings in the third quarter of 2007 were $417 million, compared with $363 million in the third quarter of 2006. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.1% to $.85, compared with $.72 a year ago. Although the yen/dollar exchange rate was slightly weaker than a year ago, it did not have a measurable impact on operating earnings per diluted share.
For the first nine months of 2007, our results were impacted by the weaker yen. Total revenues rose 4.1% to $11.4 billion, compared with $10.9 billion in the first nine months of 2006. Net earnings were $1.3 billion, or $2.53 per diluted share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $2.29 per share, for the first nine months of 2006. Net earnings for the first nine months of 2007 included realized investment gains of $18 million, or $.04 per diluted share, compared with $47 million, or $.10 per share for the first nine months of 2006. The realized investment gains for the first nine months of 2006 resulted from a bond-swap program that we completed in mid-2006. Operating earnings for the first nine months were $1.2 billion, or $2.49 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $2.19 per share, in 2006. Excluding the negative impact of $.03 per share from the weaker yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.1% for the first nine months of 2007.
 
During the third quarter, we acquired 2.0 million shares of Aflac stock, bringing the total number of shares purchased in the first nine months of 2007 to 9.1 million. At the end of September, we had 27.6 million shares available for purchase under our share repurchase authorization.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 4.2% in the third quarter. Net investment income increased 7.7%. Investment income growth in yen terms was magnified by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 39% of Aflac Japan's third quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 4.3%. Reflecting continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 15.4% to 17.2%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen advanced 16.7%. For the first nine months, premium income in yen increased 4.5%, and net investment income rose 9.1%. Total revenues grew 5.2%, and pretax operating earnings were up 13.6%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2007 was 117.88, or 1.5% weaker than the average rate of 116.17 in the third quarter of 2006. For the first nine months, the average exchange rate was 119.37, or 3.0% weaker than the rate of 115.82 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the third quarter and first nine months were suppressed as a result of the weaker average exchange rates.
Reflecting the weaker yen, premium income in dollars was up 2.8% to $2.3 billion in the third quarter. Net investment income rose 6.2% to $456 million. Total revenues increased 3.0% to $2.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $468 million, or 15.0% higher than a year ago. For the first nine months, premium income was $6.7 billion, up 1.4% from a year ago. Net investment income rose 5.9% to $1.3 billion. Total revenues increased 2.1% to $8.0 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $1.4 billion, or 10.2% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan continued to generate improved sales results for both the third quarter and first nine months of 2007. Total new annualized premium sales rose 2.2% to 27.9 billion yen, or $236 million, in the third quarter. For the first nine months, total new annualized premium sales were down 4.1% to 84.3 billion yen, or $706 million. Cancer insurance sales were again very strong, rising 21.8% over the third quarter of 2006. We believe cancer insurance sales benefited from our agents' focus on selling the product in advance of a scheduled premium rate increase on newly issued cancer life policies, which occurred on September 2. After several quarters of significant declines, medical sales in the third quarter were only slightly lower than a year ago. We believe the improvement in medical sales reflected a favorable initial response to Gentle EVER, our new medical product. Gentle EVER, a non-standard medical product, was introduced on August 1. Our objective remains for Aflac Japan total new annualized premium sales to be flat to up 4% in the second half of 2007.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 10.7% to $993 million in the third quarter. Net investment income rose 5.4% to $127 million. Total revenues were up 10.0% to $1.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $182 million, an increase of 12.3%. For the first nine months, premium income rose 10.8% to $2.9 billion. Net investment income increased 8.0% to $373 million. Total revenues were up 10.4% to $3.3 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 13.9% to $523 million.
Aflac U.S. sales were consistent with our expectations. Total new annualized premium sales rose 11.0% to $368 million in the third quarter. Aflac U.S. sales in the third quarter were again led by our accident/disability product line and cancer expense insurance. In addition, our hospital indemnity category performed very well, with sales rising 21.1% over the third quarter of 2006. For the nine months, total new annualized premium sales increased 11.1% to $1.1 billion. As we have repeatedly discussed, we face a challenging sales comparison in the fourth quarter of this year. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2006 rose 21.2% due to the re-enrollment of a large payroll account. Despite that difficult comparison, we still believe we are well-positioned to achieve our sales objective of a 6% to 10% increase for the full year.
We were also pleased with our sales force expansion in the quarter. As expected, recruiting remained lower than a year ago. However, we still recruited approximately 6,200 new sales associates in the third quarter, bringing the number of newly recruited sales associates to more than 18,600 for the first nine months of the year. The total number of licensed sales associates at the end of September rose 5.4% over a year ago. Most importantly, the number of producing sales associates again increased in line with our expectations. On an average weekly basis, the number of producing associates was up 5.0% to approximately 10,700 in the third quarter. For the first nine months, the number of average weekly producing associates rose 6.1% over a year ago.
 
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend. The fourth quarter dividend of $.205 per share is payable on December 3, 2007, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2007.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's third quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "I am very pleased with Aflac's performance during the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2007. Throughout this year, our operations in Japan and the United States have met or exceeded our expectations.
"Aflac Japan has produced steady revenue growth and expanding profit margins in 2007. As a result, Aflac Japan continued to generate strong pretax operating earnings growth. At the same time, we continue to believe Aflac Japan is building sales momentum, and we remain encouraged about our sales outlook for the balance of this year and into 2008.
"Aflac U.S. is also performing very well this year. Our persistency has been steady and our benefit and expense ratios and profit margin have been in line with our expectations. Our sales results have also been strong during the first nine months of the year. And we believe our focus on training and enhancing the capabilities of our distribution will continue to enhance our future sales activities.
"I remain confident that we will achieve our primary financial goal for 2007 of increasing operating earnings per diluted share by 15% to 16%, or $3.28 to $3.31, excluding foreign currency translation. Assuming the yen averages 115 to 120 to the dollar for the remainder of the year, we would expect to report operating earnings of $3.24 to $3.28 per diluted share for the full year. For the fourth quarter of 2007, we expect operating earnings will be in the range of $.75 to $.79 per diluted share. As we look to 2008, I believe we are also well-positioned to achieve our objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share by 13% to 15%, before the impact of the yen."

This accelerated share repurchase will be funded with internal capital.
     To provide for future share repurchase activities, the board of directors today authorized the purchase of up to an additional 30 million shares of its common stock.

Commenting on the news, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "I am very pleased with today's actions by our board of directors. These steps are consistent with our intention of deploying excess capital in a manner that benefits our shareholders, while still maintaining very strong capital adequacy ratios to support our ratings.
"In addition to accelerating our planned annual repurchase of 12 million shares, we also anticipate buying more shares later in the year, depending on market conditions. Purchasing 12 to 18 million shares this year gives us greater confidence in achieving the high end of our 13% to 15% range for operating earnings per share growth for 2008. We will also be better positioned to extend our lengthy record of strong earnings growth into 2009. I remain focused on increasing operating earnings per share by at least 15%, excluding the impact of the yen, through 2009, which will mark my first 20 years as CEO. I still believe that goal is achievable, and I continue to believe we are poised for strong growth beyond 2009 as well.
"I am also pleased with the increase in our cash dividend. Aflac's annual cash dividend payment to shareholders has compounded at 21.7% annually over the last 10 years. This increase marks the 26 consecutive year in which we have raised the dividend payment. I believe the combination of strong earnings growth and increasing cash dividends is an effective means for enhancing value to Aflac's shareholders."

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     Aflac Incorporated is providing its press release dated January 30, 2008 in which it reported its fourth quarter results herein as Exhibit 99.1.
     In accordance with General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K, the information included or incorporated in this report (Exhibit 99.1) shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except as shall be set forth by specific reference in such filing.

     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
EXHIBIT INDEX:

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  January 30, 2008  Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Total revenues benefited from the strengthening of the yen to the dollar in the fourth quarter, rising 9.0% to $4.0 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006. Net earnings were $382 million, or $.78 per diluted share, compared with $332 million, or $.67 per share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment losses of $1 million, or nil per diluted share, compared with a gain of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2006. The change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133, increased net earnings by $1 million, or nil per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. The impact from SFAS 133 in the fourth quarter of 2006 was immaterial to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency translation.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2007 were $382 million, compared with $329 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.2% to $.78, which was consistent with the expectations we communicated in our third quarter earnings release, compared with $.66 per share a year ago. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter benefited from a change in accounting for internal replacements (SOP 05-1), which increased operating earnings by $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, in the quarter. Operating earnings were also impacted by an increase in benefit reserves for closed blocks of business in Japan and the United States. The increase in reserves in the quarter lowered operating earnings by $17 million, or $.03 per diluted share. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.01 for the fourth quarter.
For the full year of 2007, our results were suppressed by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, compared with 2006. Total revenues were $15.4 billion, an increase of 5.3% over 2006. Net earnings were $1.6 billion, or
 
$3.31 per diluted share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $2.95 per share, in 2006. Full-year net earnings were impacted by lower realized investment gains in 2007, compared with 2006. Realized investment gains were $19 million in 2007, or $.04 per diluted share, compared with $51 million, or $.10 per share, in 2006. The impact of SFAS 133 was immaterial for both 2007 and 2006.
Operating earnings for the year were $1.6 billion, or $3.27 per diluted share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $2.85 per share, in 2006. Excluding the negative impact of $.02 per share from the weaker yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.4% for the year. That result was in line with our 2007 objective of a 15% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency translation.
During the fourth quarter, we acquired 2.0 million shares of our stock, bringing the total number of shares purchased in 2007 to 11.1 million.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 4.0% in the fourth quarter. Net investment income increased 4.6%. Investment income growth in yen terms was lowered somewhat by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 38% of Aflac Japan's fourth quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 4.2%. Despite the previously mentioned adjustment to Aflac Japan benefit reserves, the benefit ratio improved over a year ago. As a result, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 14.7% to 15.0%. Pretax operating earnings in yen increased 5.8%. For the year, premium income in yen increased 4.3%, and net investment income rose 8.0%. Total revenues were up 4.9%, and pretax operating earnings grew 11.8%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 113.24, or 4.1% stronger than the average rate of 117.88 in the fourth quarter of 2006. Although the yen strengthened in relation to the dollar in the fourth quarter of 2007, the average yen/dollar exchange rate was weaker for the full year, compared with 2006. For the year, the average exchange rate was 117.93 in 2007, or 1.4% weaker than the rate of 116.31 a year ago.
Benefiting from the stronger average yen in the fourth quarter, premium income in dollars increased 8.3% to $2.4 billion. Net investment income rose 8.9% to $466 million. Total revenues advanced 8.5% to $2.9 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $428 million, or 10.2% higher than a year ago. For the year, Aflac Japan's results in dollar terms were suppressed by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate in 2007. Premium income was $9.0 billion, up 3.1% from a year ago. Net investment income rose 6.7% to $1.8 billion. Total revenues were up 3.7% to $10.9 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $1.8 billion, or 10.2% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan again posted sales gains that were in line with our expectations. Total new annualized premium sales rose 2.7% to 30.3 billion yen, or $268 million, in the fourth quarter. For the year, total new annualized premium sales were down 2.4% to 114.6 billion yen, or $974 million. Although overall sales growth was again constrained by weakness in Rider MAX sales, stand-alone medical sales were strong, rising 16.8% for the quarter. Sales of medical insurance benefited from our new nonstandard medical product, Gentle EVER. At the same time, we were pleased with the sale of our cancer life insurance. Cancer life sales were down only slightly in the quarter, compared with a year ago. Our fourth quarter cancer life sales followed a very strong third quarter that reflected our agents' focus on selling the product in advance of a premium rate increase. We believe the consumer acceptance of our newly introduced Cancer Forte product helped to mitigate some of the sharp falloff in sales that usually follows a premium rate increase.
 
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 10.9% to $1.0 billion. Net investment income was up 6.2% to $127 million. Total revenues rose 10.4% to $1.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings climbed 34.2% to $170 million, which primarily reflected easy comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2006 when pretax operating earnings declined 1.8%. For the year, premium income rose 10.8% to $3.9 billion. Net investment income increased 7.5% to $500 million. Total revenues were up 10.4% to $4.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 18.3% to $692 million.
As we expected, Aflac U.S. sales growth slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, compared with the first nine months of the year. Sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2007 reflected difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of 2006 when sales benefited from the re-enrollment of a large payroll account and rose 21.2%. Despite the tough comparison, total new annualized premium sales were up 5.9% to $473 million in the fourth quarter. For the year, total new annualized premium sales increased 9.5% to a record $1.6 billion. Our sales results for the year were consistent with our 2007 sales objective of a 6% to 10% increase. Sales in the fourth quarter benefited from solid contributions in the hospital indemnity and cancer insurance lines. Fourth quarter sales also reflected an administrative change in the timing of sales associates' production credit for delay-bill policy conversions. This change accelerated approximately $8 million of conversion premiums from the first quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the impact of the change in conversion processing, total new annualized premium sales were up 4.0% for the fourth quarter and 8.9% for the year.
We continue to believe that expansion of our sales force is an important key to sales growth. As we have repeatedly discussed, we have been intensely focused on increasing the number of producing sales associates. On an average weekly basis, the number of producing associates was up 5.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.0% for the year.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's fourth quarter and full-year results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "I am very pleased with our results for 2007. Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. each achieved their sales objectives and produced strong financial results in 2007, which contributed to a record year in terms of operating earnings. I am especially proud that we achieved our primary financial objective of a 15% to 16% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, before the impact of currency translation. 2007 was the 18 year in which we have increased operating earnings per diluted share by at least 15% before the impact of the yen.
th
"From a financial perspective Aflac Japan had both a strong fourth quarter and full year. Our top-line growth was in line with our expectations, and as we expected, the benefit ratio continued to improve, resulting in expanded profit margins and strong pretax earnings growth. At the same time, Aflac Japan built sales momentum throughout the year, which we expect to continue in 2008. We look forward to new distribution opportunities through the bank channel and Japan Post, and we believe our product portfolio is well-positioned in the Japanese market. Our sales objective for 2008 is an increase of 3% to 7%.
"Aflac U.S. also performed very well throughout the year. Our U.S. operation generated strong financial results, highlighted by improved operating trends and strong earnings growth. We were again pleased with the sales momentum of Aflac U.S. We believe our sales growth reflects a quality product line and enhanced training to a steadily growing sales force. As we noted, sales in the fourth quarter benefited from the change in our conversion processing practices, and will take away from first-quarter 2008 sales. As a result, we expect Aflac U.S. sales will be weak in the first quarter. However, we believe a sales increase of 8% to 12% is an achievable objective for 2008. We remain enthusiastic about the sales opportunities of the vast and underpenetrated U.S. market.
"I believe our earnings outlook for 2008 remains very promising. Our objective for 2008 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 13% to 15%, or $3.70 to $3.76, excluding the impact of the yen. Our
 
confidence in achieving that objective is based on the predictable earnings characteristics of Aflac's large block of in-force business. Our earnings target also reflects the opportunities we see in Japan and the United States, as well as the product, distribution and branding strengths we bring to these two large markets. We will continue to build on our strengths and position Aflac for another record year."

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
     On February 4, 2008, Aflac Incorporated entered into an agreement for an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program with an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (Merrill Lynch). Under the Agreement, Aflac purchased 12.5 million shares of its outstanding common stock at $60.58 per share for a total purchase price of $757 million. The repurchase was funded with internal capital. Aflac is acquiring these shares as a part of previously announced share repurchase authorizations by its board of directors that had 55.6 million shares available for purchase as of February 4, 2008. The shares will be held in treasury.
     Under the Agreement, Merrill Lynch plans to purchase shares of Aflac common stock in the open market from time to time until it has acquired a number of shares equivalent to the number of shares purchased by Aflac. At the end of this period, Aflac may receive, or may be required to remit, a purchase price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of its common shares during the ASR program period. Aflac may elect to receive or pay any settlement amount in cash or shares of its common stock at its option. The completion and settlement of the ASR program is expected to occur during the second quarter of 2008 although the settlement may occur before the second quarter at Merrill Lynch's option.
     The foregoing description of the ASR program is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Master Confirmation of OTC ASAP Minus (VWAP Pricing) and the Form of Supplemental Confirmation of OTC ASAP Minus (VWAP Pricing) (collectively, the Confirmation) for the transaction, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Confirmation contains other terms governing the transactions, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the program, the settlement method, the circumstances under which Merrill Lynch is permitted to make adjustments to valuation periods, the circumstances under which the program may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by Aflac and Merrill Lynch.
     Merrill Lynch and certain of its affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in financial advisory, investment banking and other services for Aflac.

EXHIBIT INDEX:

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  April 23, 2008  Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
Total revenues were $4.3 billion during the first quarter of 2008, compared with $3.8 billion in the first quarter of 2007. Net earnings were $474 million, or $.98 per diluted share, compared with $416 million, or $.84 per share, a year ago. Net earnings included realized investment losses of $4 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with $9 million of realized gains, or $.02 per diluted share a year ago. The impact on net earnings from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133, increased net earnings by $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. The impact from SFAS 133 was immaterial in the first quarter of 2007.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency. The chart at the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2008 were $475 million, compared with $407 million in the first quarter of 2007. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 19.5% in the quarter to $.98, compared with $.82 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.05 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 13.4%.
During the first quarter, we acquired 12.5 million shares of Aflac stock through a previously announced accelerated share repurchase program. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 43 million shares available for repurchase under authorizations by the board of directors.
 
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's financial results in the first quarter were solid and consistent with our expectations. Total revenues rose 2.7%. Premium income in yen increased 3.6% in the first quarter of 2008, and net investment income rose .2%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 37% of Aflac Japan's first quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, Aflac Japan's net investment income rose 5.1%. Due to the continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 17.6% to 18.0%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen were up 4.8%. Adjusting for the impact of the stronger yen on Aflac Japan's dollar-denominated investment income, pretax earnings rose 10.6%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2008 was 105.06, compared with an average rate of 119.48 in the first quarter of 2007. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms were significantly enhanced as a result of the 13.7% strengthening of the average exchange rate during the quarter.
Total revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 16.6%. Premium income in dollars was $2.6 billion in the first quarter, up 17.7% over a year ago. Net investment income rose 13.7% to $496 million. Pretax operating earnings climbed 19.2% in the quarter to $554 million.
Aflac Japan produced better-than-expected sales in the first quarter. Total new sales increased 5.0% to 27.6 billion yen, or $264 million in the first quarter. We had anticipated that first quarter sales growth would be below our annual objective due primarily to an expected slow start in the recently opened bank channel. Bank channel sales were 276 million yen, or just 1% of total new sales in the first quarter. However, as the year progresses, we expect to see further sales gains in the bank channel. By April 1, 2008, 90 banks had agreed to offer our products to their customers. Sales in the quarter benefited from significant improvement in our stand-alone medical insurance sales. Medical sales were up 17.6% and reflected a strong contribution from Gentle EVER, our nonstandard medical product. We were also pleased with the growth of cancer insurance sales, which reflected the success of our new Cancer Forte product.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. produced strong financial results in the first quarter. Total revenues were up 8.4% to $1.2 billion. Premium income increased 9.3% to $1.1 billion. In late 2007, we transferred $450 million from Aflac U.S. to Aflac Incorporated, which resulted in reduced invested assets and slower investment income growth for Aflac U.S. in the first quarter. Net investment income rose 1.3% to $123 million. Pretax operating earnings were $191 million, an increase of 12.6% over the first quarter of 2007.
As expected, Aflac U.S. sales were weak in the first quarter. Total new annualized premium sales were $353 million, or .4% above the first quarter of 2007. Our sales results primarily reflected a sharp decline in January due to an administrative change in the processing of conversions. That processing change shifted approximately $8 million of conversion premium from the first quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales improved in February and March, rising at mid-single-digit rates. The hospital indemnity category continued to perform well, increasing 14.3% for the first three months of the year.
We remain committed and focused on enhancing the distribution side of our business. We were pleased with recruitment in the quarter. We recruited approximately 6,500 new sales associates, an increase of 8.6%, compared with a year ago. The number of average weekly producing sales associates rose .2% in the quarter.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend of $.24 per share. The second quarter dividend is payable on June 2, 2008, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 21, 2008.
 
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Although we have completed just one quarter, I believe we are on track for another record year from a financial perspective.
"Aflac Japan posted a very good quarter, producing financial results that were consistent with our targets. We were especially pleased to see a continued recovery in new sales. Our sales increase of 5.0% exceeded our expectations. Furthermore, the addition of banks as a distribution channel should help Aflac Japan achieve its sales objective of a 3% to 7% increase in yen for 2008.
"Our financial results for Aflac U.S. were also good. Our top line was consistent with our outlook and pretax operating earnings were better than expected, although we anticipated our sales would be a bit higher. However, from the start of February through the third week of April, our U.S. sales increased 6.5%. It will clearly be more challenging to achieve our 2008 sales objective of an 8% to 12% increase, but we still believe it is attainable.
"As a result of our solid first quarter, our increased confidence has allowed us to narrow our target from a 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share this year, before the effect of foreign currency, to a 14% to 15% increase. A 14% to 15% increase would result in $3.73 to $3.76 in reported operating earnings per diluted share, assuming the same average exchange rate in 2008, compared with 2007. However, so far this year the yen is significantly stronger to the dollar than it was a year ago. If the stronger yen persists throughout the year, it will favorably impact our reported results in dollar terms. Assuming the yen averages 100 to 105 for the year, we would expect to report operating earnings per diluted share of $3.95 to $4.09 in 2008. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect second quarter operating earnings to be $1.00 to $1.02 per diluted share."

EXHIBIT INDEX:

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  July 23, 2008  Aflac Incorporated today reported its second quarter results.
Reflecting a stronger yen to the dollar, total revenues increased 15.2% to $4.3 billion during the second quarter of 2008, compared with $3.8 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $483 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with $415 million, or $.84 per share, a year ago. Realized investment losses were $1 million, or nil per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008, compared with realized investment gains of $9 million, or $.02 per share a year ago. Net earnings in the second quarter of 2008 included a loss of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the second quarter of 2007, the impact of SFAS 133 decreased net earnings by $1 million, or nil per diluted share.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $487 million, compared with $407 million in the second quarter of 2007. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 23.2% to $1.01, compared with $.82 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.08 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 13.4%.
Results for the first six months of 2008 also benefited from a stronger yen. Total revenues rose 14.5% to $8.6 billion, compared with $7.5 billion in the first half of 2007. Net earnings were $957 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, compared with $831 million, or $1.68 per share, for the first six months of 2007. Operating earnings for the first six months of 2008 were $962 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, compared with $814 million, or $1.64 per share, in 2007. Excluding the benefit of $.13 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 13.4% for the first six months of the year.
 
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 2.9%. Premium income in yen rose 3.6%, and net investment income declined .7% in the second quarter. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 37% of Aflac Japan's second quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, net investment income was up 5.0% in the quarter. Due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 17.4% to 18.2%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 7.5%. For the first six months, premium income in yen increased 3.6%, and net investment income was down .3%. Total revenues were up 2.8%, and pretax operating earnings grew 6.1%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the second quarter of 2008 was 104.50, or 15.6% stronger than the average rate of 120.78 in the second quarter of 2007. For the first six months, the average exchange rate was 104.77, or 14.7% stronger than the rate of 120.13 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the second quarter and first six months were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 19.7% to $2.6 billion in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 14.8% to $508 million. Total revenues increased 18.9% to $3.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings advanced 24.3% to $573 million. For the first six months, premium income was $5.2 billion, or 18.7% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 14.3% to $1.0 billion. Total revenues were up 17.8% to $6.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $1.1 billion, or 21.7% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales declined 4.9% to 28.7 billion yen, or $274 million in the second quarter. For the first six months, total new premium sales were down .3% to 56.3 billion yen, or $537 million. Second quarter sales results reflected an 11.1% decline in cancer product sales, compared with a year ago. The decline in cancer insurance sales reflected challenging comparisons to 2007 when cancer insurance sales benefited from advanced purchases of our product prior to a pending premium rate increase. In addition, our sales associates focused on selling a lower premium cancer insurance product in the second quarter that upgrades the coverage for existing policyholders. Medical insurance sales rose 8.7% in the quarter, benefiting from the sale of our nonstandard medical product, Gentle EVER. Bank channel sales increased 146.4% in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter. While that is a significant improvement, we had expected the bank channel to do even better.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues rose 8.4% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. Premium income increased 9.5% to $1.1 billion and net investment income was up .1% to $125 million. Pretax operating earnings were $190 million, an increase of 11.1%. For the first six months, total revenues were up 8.4% to $2.4 billion. Premium income rose 9.4% to $2.1 billion. Net investment income increased .7% to $248 million. Pretax operating earnings rose 11.8% to $380 million.
Total new annualized premium sales rose 4.9% to $383 million in the second quarter of 2008. Although second quarter sales growth was below our annual target of an 8% to 12% increase, the rate of growth improved significantly over the first quarter of 2008. For the six months, total new annualized premium sales increased 2.7% to $736 million.
New agent recruitment continued to be solid this year. The number of newly recruited agents rose 4.2% in the second quarter to more than 6,700. Additionally, the average number of weekly producing sales associates increased, rising 6.3% in the second quarter. We continue to believe that the ongoing expansion of a productive sales force is an important driver of future sales growth. We also believe our success at increasing the number of producing sales associates has resulted from the enhanced training programs we have been implementing over the last few years.
 
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.24 per share is payable on September 2, 2008, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 20, 2008.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's second quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "I am pleased with Aflac's financial performance for the first half of 2008. In both the United States and Japan, our financial results have met or exceeded our expectations so far this year.
"I am encouraged by the improvement of our U.S. sales growth in the second quarter following a very slow start in the first quarter of this year. Knowing that we need a 12.5% increase in the second half of the year to meet the low end of our sales target, it will clearly be difficult to achieve the minimum of an 8% increase for 2008. As I have mentioned previously, we can't rule out that the U.S. economy is a contributing factor to slower sales growth. However, we still believe our products remain affordable to the average American consumer. And we are convinced that the protection our products provide is even more valuable when a significant health event occurs at a time of rising food and gas prices, and we're working to convey that message to consumers through our commercials and sales force.
"For Aflac Japan, we were not surprised to see weak second quarter sales. Yet, we did expect a sales increase in the quarter. With sales being flat for the first six months of the year, it will be more challenging to achieve our objective of a 3% to 7% sales increase for the year than anticipated. However, we expect to see improved sales growth in the second half of 2008, and I still believe our sales objective is achievable. My optimism for meeting our target is based on the strength of our product line and the new distribution opportunities through the bank channel and Japan Post.
"One of the very favorable attributes of Aflac's business model is our predictable earnings growth even in periods when sales are not as predictable. It appears that we are in one of those periods. However, even though our sales growth has been slower than we expected so far this year, our outlook for earnings has not changed. Our earnings growth primarily reflects our large and profitable block of in-force business. Importantly, the claims, expense and margin trends of our business in force remain predictable and very favorable. As a result, I believe we are well-positioned to achieve our earnings targets for 2008 and 2009.
"Our objective for 2008 remains an increase of 14% to 15% in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Achieving that target would result in operating earnings of $3.73 to $3.76 per diluted share this year, assuming the same average exchange rate we experienced in 2007. However, through the first half of 2008, the yen has been significantly stronger to the dollar, compared with a year ago. If the stronger yen persists throughout the year, it will continue to benefit our reported results in dollar terms. Assuming the yen averages 105 to 110 for the full year, we would expect to report operating earnings per diluted share of $3.86 to $3.98 in 2008. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect third quarter operating earnings to be $.98 to $1.01 per diluted share. For 2009, our objective remains a 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of the yen/dollar exchange rate."

     On August 26, 2008, Aflac Incorporated entered into an agreement for a share repurchase program with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GS&Co."). Under the agreement, which terminates February 18, 2009, Aflac paid $825 million to GS&Co. for the repurchase of a variable number of its shares over the stated contract period. In connection with the agreement, GS&Co. will deliver 6.0 million shares on December 23, 2008, and 5.0 million shares on January 5, 2009. Final settlement of the agreement will occur on the agreement termination date, at which time Aflac may receive additional shares of its common stock, or may be required to remit, at its option cash or additional shares of its common stock, based upon the volume weighted average price of its common shares for a specified period during the term of the agreement. The repurchase was funded with internal capital. Aflac is acquiring these shares as a part of previously announced share repurchase authorizations by its board of directors that had 43.1 million shares available for purchase as of August 26, 2008. The shares will be held in treasury.
     The foregoing description of the share repurchase program is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Master Confirmation, the Form of Supplemental Confirmation, the Form of Trade Notification and the Form of Counterparty Settlement Provisions (collectively, the Confirmation) for the transaction, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference. The Confirmation contains the terms governing the transaction, including, but not limited to, the mechanism used to determine the final settlement of the program, the settlement terms, the circumstances under which the program may be terminated early, and various acknowledgements, representations and warranties made by Aflac and GS&Co.

The additional terms of any particular Transaction shall be set forth in (i) a Supplemental Confirmation in the form of Schedule A hereto (a ""), which shall reference this Master Confirmation and supplement, form a part of, and be subject to this Master Confirmation and (ii) a Trade Notification in the form of Schedule B hereto (a ""), which shall reference the relevant Supplemental Confirmation and supplement, form a part of, and be subject to such Supplemental Confirmation. This Master Confirmation, each Supplemental Confirmation and the related Trade Notification together shall constitute a "Confirmation" as referred to in the Agreement specified below.

Trade Notification
     The definitions and provisions contained in the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions (the ""), as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., are incorporated into this Master Confirmation.

Equity Definitions
     This Master Confirmation, each Supplemental Confirmation and each Trade Notification supplement, form a part of, and are subject to an agreement in the form of the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) (the "") as if GS&Co. and Counterparty had executed the Agreement on the date of this Master Confirmation (but without any Schedule except for (i) the election of Loss and Second Method, New York law (without reference to its choice of laws doctrine other than Title 14 of Article 5 of the New York General Obligations Law) as the governing law and US Dollars ("") as the Termination Currency, (ii) the replacement of the word "third" in the last line of Section 5(a)(i) with the word "first," (iii) the election that the "Cross Default" provisions of Section 5(a)(vi) shall apply to Counterparty, with a "Threshold Amount" of USD 50 million and (iv) the deletion of the phrase ", or becoming capable at such time of being declared," in the seventh line of Section 5(a)(vi) of the Agreement).

If there exists any ISDA Master Agreement between GS&Co. and Counterparty or any confirmation or other agreement between GS&Co. and Counterparty pursuant to which an ISDA Master Agreement is deemed to exist between GS&Co. and Counterparty, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in such ISDA Master Agreement, such confirmation or agreement or
 
any other agreement to which GS&Co. and Counterparty are parties, the Transactions shall not be considered Transactions under, or otherwise governed by, such existing or deemed ISDA Master Agreement.
     All provisions contained or incorporated by reference in the Agreement shall govern this Master Confirmation, each Supplemental Confirmation and each Trade Notification except as expressly modified herein or in the related Supplemental Confirmation.
     If, in relation to any Transaction to which this Master Confirmation, a Supplemental Confirmation and a Trade Notification relate, there is any inconsistency between the Agreement, this Master Confirmation, any Supplemental Confirmation, any Trade Notification and the Equity Definitions, the following will prevail for purposes of such Transaction in the order of precedence indicated: (i) such Trade Notification, (ii) such Supplemental Confirmation; (iii) this Master Confirmation; (iv) the Agreement; and (v) the Equity Definitions.

later than the Early Termination Date, elect for GS&Co. or Counterparty, as the case may be, to deliver to the other party a number of Shares (or, in the case of a Merger Event, a number of units, each comprising the number or amount of the securities or property that a hypothetical holder of one Share would receive in such Merger Event (each such unit, an "" and, the securities or property comprising such unit, "")) with a value equal to all (in the case of such an election by either party) or any portion (in the case of such an election by GS&Co. only) of the Payment Amount, as determined by the Calculation Agent (and the parties agree that, in making such determination of value, the Calculation Agent may take into account a number of factors, including the market price of the Shares or Alternative Delivery Property on the date of early termination and, if such delivery is made by GS&Co., the prices at which GS&Co. purchases Shares or Alternative Delivery Property to fulfill its delivery obligations under this Section 14), in lieu of payment of the Payment Amount or such portion thereof, as the case may be; that in determining the composition of any Alternative Delivery Unit, if the relevant Merger Event involves a choice of consideration to be received by holders, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to receive the maximum possible amount of cash. If such delivery is made by Counterparty, paragraphs 2 through 7 of Annex A shall apply as if such delivery were a settlement of the Transaction to which Net Share Settlement applied, the Cash Settlement Payment Date were the Early Termination Date and the Forward Cash Settlement Amount were zero (0) the Payment Amount owed by Counterparty.

15.    . The parties acknowledge and agree that in calculating Loss pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement GS&Co. may (but need not) determine losses without reference to actual losses incurred but based on expected losses assuming a commercially reasonable (including without limitation with regard to reasonable legal and regulatory guidelines) risk bid were used to determine loss to avoid awaiting the delay associated with closing out any hedge or related trading position in a commercially reasonable manner prior to or sooner following the designation of an Early Termination Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6(d)(ii) of the Agreement, all amounts calculated as being due in respect of an Early Termination Date under Section 6(e) of the Agreement will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective; that if Counterparty elects to receive Shares or Alternative Delivery Property in accordance with Section 14, such Shares or Alternative Delivery Property shall be delivered on a date selected by GS&Co as promptly as practicable.
Calculations and Payment Date upon Early Termination
provided
16.    . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 6 of the Agreement, if a Termination Price is specified in any Supplemental Confirmation, then an Additional Termination Event with Counterparty as the sole Affected Party and the Transaction to which such Supplemental Confirmation relates as the Affected Transaction will automatically occur without any notice or action by GS&Co. or Counterparty if the price of the Shares on the Exchange at any time falls below such Termination Price, and the Exchange Business Day that the price of the Shares on the Exchange at any time falls below the Termination Price will be the "Early Termination Date" for purposes of the Agreement.
Automatic Termination Provisions
17.    . For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Master Confirmation shall be interpreted as requiring Counterparty to deliver cash in respect of the settlement of the Transactions contemplated by this Master Confirmation following payment by Counterparty of the relevant Prepayment Amount, except in circumstances where the required cash settlement thereof is permitted for classification of the contract as equity by EITF 00-19 as in effect on the relevant Trade Date (including, without limitation, where Counterparty so elects to deliver cash or fails timely to elect to deliver Shares or Alternative Delivery Property in respect of the settlement of such Transactions).
Delivery of Cash
18.    . GS&Co. acknowledges and agrees that this Confirmation is not intended to convey to it rights with respect to the Transaction that are senior to the claims of common stockholders in the event of Counterparty's bankruptcy.
Claim in Bankruptcy
19.    . Counterparty hereby agrees that if, in the good faith reasonable judgment of GS&Co., any Shares (the "") acquired in the U.S. public market by GS&Co. in connection with a Transaction cannot be sold in the U.S. public market by GS&Co. without registration under the Securities Act at or about the time of any early termination or cancellation of such Transaction, Counterparty shall, at its election: (i) in order to allow GS&Co. to sell the Hedge Shares in a registered offering, make available to GS&Co. an effective registration statement under the Securities Act to cover the resale of such Hedge Shares and (A) enter into an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to GS&Co., substantially in the form of an underwriting agreement

(in which case, the Calculation Agent shall make any adjustments to the terms of such Transaction or its early termination or cancellation that are necessary, in its reasonable judgment, to compensate GS&Co. for any discount from the public market price of the Shares incurred on the sale of Hedge Shares in a private placement); or (iii) purchase the Hedge Shares from GS&Co. at the VWAP Price on such Exchange Business Days, and in the amounts, requested by GS&Co.

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  October 2, 2008  Aflac Incorporated announced today that it will take early delivery of 10.7 million common shares that were acquired through a previously announced repurchase agreement. The company will also receive $141.8 million of unused funds. This will bring the total number of shares Aflac has repurchased in 2008 to 23.2 million.
Commenting on the announcement, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Given the uncertainties in the marketplace, we felt it was best to take early delivery of the shares and terminate the agreement at this time. However, we still believe that repurchasing our shares is the best use of excess capital, and we will continue to purchase our shares in a way that is consistent with our financial objectives. At the same time, we continue to believe we are well-positioned to achieve our objectives for earnings-per-share growth for this year and next. Our goal for 2008 is a 14% to 15% increase in operating earnings per share, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Our objective for 2009 is to increase operating earnings per share 13% to 15%, excluding the impact of foreign currency."

EXHIBIT INDEX:

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  October 23, 2008  Aflac Incorporated today reported its third quarter results.
Total revenues declined 4.4% to $3.7 billion during the third quarter of 2008 due to realized investment losses, compared with $3.9 billion in the third quarter of 2007. Net earnings were $100 million, or $.21 per diluted share, compared with $420 million, or $.85 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the third quarter included realized investment losses of $389 million, or $.81 per diluted share, compared with a realized investment gain of $1 million, or nil per diluted share in the third quarter of 2007. Approximately $198 million of the after-tax investment losses in the third quarter reflected management's decision to sell its holdings in Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual and impair its investment in Ford Motor Company, in addition to other smaller securities transactions.
Aflac also impaired investments in certain perpetual debentures, or so-called "hybrid securities," which accounted for the remaining $191 million of the investment losses in the quarter. Hybrid securities have characteristics of both debt and equity investments, along with unique features that create economic maturity dates. Since first purchasing hybrid securities in 1993, the company, with the concurrence of its independent auditors, had classified them as debt instruments and applied a debt impairment model.
In light of the unprecedented volatility in the debt and equity markets, and following discussions with its independent auditors, Aflac concluded that all of its hybrid investments should be classified as available for sale and evaluated using an equity impairment model. The impairment charge on the perpetual debentures in the third quarter was computed by applying the company's equity impairment policy to this asset class through June 30, 2008. The impact on prior reporting periods was not material. The June 30 valuation date was used following the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on the topic of the appropriate impairment model to apply to hybrid securities. In its letter dated October 14, 2008, the SEC stated that, given the debt characteristics of hybrid securities, a debt impairment model could be used for filings subsequent to October 14, 2008, until the FASB further addresses the appropriate impairment approach.
Net earnings in the third quarter of 2008 also included a loss of $4 million, or nil per diluted share, from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133. In the third quarter of 2007, the impact from SFAS 133 increased net earnings by $2 million, or nil per diluted share.
In the fourth quarter, three Icelandic banks, Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, were placed into receivership and are presently being operated by the Icelandic government, which is also in financial distress. As a result, Aflac expects to take an after-tax charge of approximately $110 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 to reflect the impairment of these securities.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring
 
items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the third quarter of 2008 were $493 million, compared with $417 million in the third quarter of 2007. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 20.0% to $1.02, compared with $.85 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings by $.04 per diluted share. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.3% in the third quarter, excluding the benefit from the stronger yen.
For the first nine months of 2008, total revenues rose 8.1% to $12.3 billion, compared with $11.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007. Net earnings were $1.1 billion, or $2.19 per diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $2.53 per share, for the first nine months of 2007. Operating earnings for the first nine months were $1.5 billion, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $2.49 per share, in 2007. Excluding the benefit of $.17 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% for the first nine months of 2008.
As previously announced, the company took early delivery of 10.7 million of its common shares, bringing the total number of shares purchased in 2008 to 23.2 million. As of October 23, 2008, the company had 32.4 million shares remaining for purchase under authorization from the board of directors.
Total investments and cash at the end of September were $60.7 billion, or 10.3% higher than a year ago. The increase in total investments and cash resulted from solid cash flows to investments and a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of the third quarter, compared with a year ago. However, these benefits were offset by the global widening of credit spreads, which produced lower fair values for debt securities that are classified as available for sale on the balance sheet. Gross unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available for sale were $3.1 billion at September 30, 2008, compared with $1.0 billion a year ago, and $2.1 billion at June 30, 2008.
Shareholders' equity was $6.5 billion at September 30, 2008, compared with $8.5 billion a year ago, and $7.9 billion at June 30, 2008. Shareholders' equity at September 30, 2008, included a net unrealized loss on investment securities of $882 million, which resulted from the widening of credit spreads, compared with a net unrealized gain on investment securities of $755 million a year ago, and a net unrealized loss of $214 million at June 30, 2008. In addition, shareholders' equity at September 30, 2008, reflected the use of internal capital to fund the repurchase of the company's common shares in 2008. The return on average shareholders' equity in the third quarter was 5.6%. On an operating basis, (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of SFAS 133 from net earnings and the unrealized investment losses in shareholders' equity) the return on average shareholders' equity was 25.4% for the third quarter of 2008.
 
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 3.6% in the third quarter. Net investment income increased ..9%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 37% of Aflac Japan's third quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 3.3%. Reflecting continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 17.2% to 18.3%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen advanced 10.1%. For the first nine months, premium income in yen increased 3.6%, and net investment income rose .1%. Total revenues grew 3.0%, and pretax operating earnings were up 7.5%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2008 was 107.70, or 9.5% stronger than the average rate of 117.88 in the third quarter of 2007. For the first nine months, the average exchange rate was 105.75, or 12.9% stronger than the average rate of 119.37 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the third quarter and first nine months were enhanced as a result of the stronger average exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars was up 13.3% to $2.6 billion in the third quarter. Net investment income rose 10.4% to $504 million. Total revenues increased 13.1% to $3.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $563 million, or 20.5% higher than a year ago. For the first nine months, premium income was $7.8 billion, up 16.9% from a year ago. Net investment income rose 12.9% to $1.5 billion. Total revenues increased 16.2% to $9.3 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $1.7 billion, or 21.3% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan produced improved sales results in the third quarter. Total new annualized premium sales rose .9% to 28.1 billion yen, or $262 million, in the third quarter. Third quarter sales benefited from our efforts to upgrade the coverage of our existing cancer insurance policyholders. As a result, cancer insurance sales rose 5.5% in the third quarter. Medical sales were down only slightly in the quarter, reflecting difficult comparisons to last year, when we introduced Gentle EVER, our nonstandard medical product. For the first nine months, total new annualized premium sales were up .1% to 84.4 billion yen, or $799 million. Sales through the new bank channel were 1.3 billion yen, an increase of 92.8% over the second quarter of 2008. Despite the solid improvement in third quarter sales, compared with the second quarter, it will be difficult to achieve our full year objective of a 3% to 7% increase, based on our nine month results.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 8.5% to $1.1 billion in the third quarter. Net investment income rose 1.7% to $129 million. Total revenues were up 7.8% to $1.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $204 million, an increase of 11.9%. For the first nine months, premium income rose 9.1% to $3.2 billion. Net investment income increased 1.0% to $376 million. Total revenues were up 8.2% to $3.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 11.9% to $585 million.
The sales environment in the United States remained challenging. Aflac U.S. total new annualized premium sales rose .1% to $369 million in the third quarter. For the nine months, total new annualized premium sales increased 1.8% to $1.1 billion. We believe sales were impacted by the continued weakness in the U.S. economy as well as Hurricane Ike, which significantly disrupted sales activities in our top-producing state.
Although sales are running below our annual objective so far this year, we continue to be pleased with the steady expansion of our sales force. During the third quarter, we recruited more than 6,400 new sales associates, an increase of 4.9%, compared with a year ago. The number of average weekly producing sales associates also rose in the third quarter, increasing 3.7% to more than 11,000. Like the second quarter of this year, we had solid new payroll account growth in the third quarter, with the number of new accounts rising 6.4% over last year.
 
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend. The fourth quarter dividend of $.24 per share is payable on December 1, 2008, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 19, 2008. The board of directors also approved a 16.7% increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective with the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter cash dividend of $.28 per share is payable on March 2, 2009, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2009.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's third quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, I am very pleased with Aflac's operational performance for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. It's during uncertain times like these that we are fortunate to have a very large and stable customer base, a resilient business model, and a strong balance sheet. We had hoped to see better sales in both the United States and Japan this year. Certainly, the U.S. economic environment has become more challenging as the year has progressed, yet the foundation of Aflac U.S. is still strong. In Japan, we remain encouraged about the opportunities to sell through new distribution outlets. Sales through the bank channel were solid. We just began offering our cancer insurance product through the Japan Post Network Co. on October 1, and we are very pleased with the initial sales effort through this new channel.
"Although we are not pleased to have incurred investment losses in the third quarter, we remain convinced that our time-tested investment approach of buying long-duration investment-grade debt securities to match our long-duration policy liabilities is in the best interests of our policyholders and shareholders. We have no direct investment exposure to the subprime lending market, and as a matter of corporate policy, we do not purchase speculative investments, such as junk bonds. In addition, our predictable cash flows to investments remain very strong. In fact, we invested on average more than $18 million every business day during the first nine months of this year.
"We remain very confident in the strength of our capital position, especially as it relates to regulatory solvency standards. We typically do not compute a risk-based capital ratio on an interim basis. However, given the current environment, we felt it was appropriate to do so. Our calculations put our risk-based capital ratio at an estimated 495% at the end of September 2008, despite the negative impact of the third quarter investment losses and the strength of the yen. In light of our strong risk-based capital ratio, we do not see a need for raising additional capital.
"The strength of our balance sheet has enabled us to absorb the third quarter losses in our investment portfolio, while still maintaining activities that benefit our shareholders, such as paying cash dividends. We are very pleased with the action by the board of directors to increase the cash dividend 16.7% effective with the first quarter of next year. This increase is consistent with our dividend policy of increasing cash dividends at a faster rate than the growth of operating earnings per diluted share, excluding currency fluctuations.
"Most important, we continue to believe that we are well-positioned to achieve our stated earnings objectives for this year and next. We are upwardly revising our goal to increase operating earnings per diluted share from a 14% to 15% increase in 2008 to a 15% increase, excluding the impact of the yen. As we have previously stated, we also believe our 2009 objective of increasing operating earnings per diluted share by 13% to 15%, before the impact of the yen, is an achievable target."

EXHIBIT INDEX:

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  January 23, 2009  Aflac Incorporated today has offered comments on its capital position following the sharp drop in its share price that resulted from an investment firm's research report.
Aflac Chairman and CEO Daniel P. Amos stated: "As we stand today, we remain very confident in our overall business model and our operations. We are equally confident with the quality of our balance sheet and our capital position. For many years we have pursued a consistent investment approach, which we believe is in the best interests of our policyholders and shareholders.
"That approach has proven to be effective and prudent, and we continue to believe it will be so in the future. At the end of 2008, 98% of the debt securities and perpetual debentures that we own were investment grade. Going forward, our investment approach will continue to emphasize the purchase and ownership of securities that best match our policy liabilities and best serve our policyholders. When we release fourth quarter earnings in just over a week, we expect to report operating earnings per diluted share that are consistent with our stated earnings objective of a 15% increase. In addition, we see no change to our expected 2009 cash dividend payments."
Further commenting on the company's capital position, Aflac Incorporated Chief Financial Officer Kriss Cloninger III added, "Although these results are preliminary, we estimate that our year-end risk-based capital ratio was 425% to 475%. A primary reason for our current risk-based capital level is the effect of the stronger yen to the dollar. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, we estimate the risk-based capital ratio would have exceeded 600%. We estimate our current excess capital position to be approximately $500 million to $1.0 billion at the end of December 2008. We believe our capital position is more than adequate to support our current ratings. We continue to expect strong statutory earnings in the future, which we estimate were $1.5 billion for the full year of 2008. Accordingly, we do not see a need for raising additional capital.
"I think it's also appropriate to comment on the status of the perpetual debentures, or so-called "hybrid securities" we own. Based on preliminary year-end numbers, our holdings of hybrid securities at fair value were $8.1 billion, or approximately 11.8% of our consolidated investment portfolio of $68.6 billion. We purchased the hybrid securities from 1993 to 2005. For GAAP accounting purposes, the perpetual debentures are held in the available-for-sale category. As such, they are marked to market and reflected on the balance sheet at fair value. By contrast, these perpetual debentures are carried at amortized cost for statutory accounting purposes. That means that the changes in the fair value of these hybrid securities are not included in, and therefore do not impact, the risk-based capital ratio.
"As we discussed in our third quarter earnings announcement and conference call, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a letter on October 14, 2008, to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on the topic of hybrid securities. The SEC's letter noted that due to the debt characteristics of hybrid securities, a debt impairment model could be used for filings subsequent to October 14, 2008, until the FASB further addresses whether a debt or equity impairment approach is most appropriate. Aflac's debt impairment approach is primarily based on an assessment of whether it is highly probable we will receive timely payment of interest and principal, whereas our equity impairment approach is based on the aging and degree of unrealized losses. With no pronouncement forthcoming from the FASB, we continued to apply our
 
debt impairment model to the perpetual debenture investments as of December 31, 2008. Pending new guidance from the FASB, we will continue to use the debt impairment approach. In addition, for statutory accounting purposes, we will continue to evaluate our perpetual debenture holdings using the debt impairment approach, and we do not anticipate that approach changing."
The company is set to release fourth quarter 2008 results after the market closes on February 2, 2009. Aflac Incorporated will webcast its fourth quarter investor presentation via the "Investors" page of aflac.com at 6:40 p.m. (EST) on Tuesday, February 3, 2009.

EXHIBIT INDEX:

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  February 2, 2009  Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Total revenues benefited from the strengthening of the yen to the dollar in the fourth quarter, rising 6.0% to $4.3 billion, compared with $4.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net earnings were $197 million, or $.42 per diluted share, compared with $382 million, or $.78 per share, a year ago.
For the full year of 2008, our results also benefited from the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, compared with 2007. Total revenues were $16.6 billion, an increase of 7.5% over 2007. Net earnings were $1.3 billion, or $2.62 per diluted share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $3.31 per share, in 2007. The decline in net earnings for the full year was attributable to realized investment losses. Realized investment losses were $655 million in 2008, or $1.37 per diluted share, compared with realized investment gains of $19 million, or $.04 per share, in 2007. The impact of SFAS 133 was immaterial for both 2008 and 2007.
Net earnings in the fourth quarter included realized investment losses of $262 million, or $.56 per diluted share, compared with a loss of $1 million, or nil per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2007. Approximately $117 million of the after-tax investment losses in the fourth quarter related to the previously announced impairment of the company's investment in three Icelandic banks. Following an impairment analysis in the fourth quarter, the company concluded there was an increased probability that the contractual terms of interest and principal payments may not be met for certain collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). As a result, the company realized $125 million of after-tax losses related to the impairment of CDOs.
As discussed in the company's third quarter earnings announcement, Aflac owns a portfolio of perpetual debentures, or so-called "hybrid securities." The company's holdings of these perpetual debentures, which have characteristics of both debt and equity investments, totaled $9.1 billion at amortized cost ($8.0 billion at fair value) at the end of December 31, 2008. Included in the company's investment in perpetual debentures are $6.5 billion at amortized cost ($6.2 billion at fair value) of Upper Tier II securities and $2.6 billion at amortized cost ($1.8 billion at fair value) of Tier I securities. At the end of 2008, 92% of the company's total perpetual debenture securities were rated A or higher. With the exception of the previously mentioned Icelandic bank securities that were written off in the fourth quarter of 2008, all of the perpetual debentures owned by Aflac were current on interest and principal payments at the end of the year.
On October 14, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on the topic of hybrid securities. The SEC's letter noted that due to the debt characteristics of hybrid securities, a debt impairment model could be used for filings subsequent to October 14, 2008, until the FASB further addresses whether a debt or equity impairment approach is most appropriate. With no action taken by the FASB in the fourth quarter, Aflac continued to apply its debt impairment model to its perpetual debenture investments, which Aflac has applied for reporting periods commencing after June 30, 2008. As such, no impairment charges of our perpetual debentures were warranted in the fourth quarter other than those related to previously mentioned Icelandic banks.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not
 
actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2008 were $458 million, compared with $382 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 25.6% to $.98, compared with $.78 per share a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.07 for the fourth quarter. Excluding the benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 16.7% in the fourth quarter.
Operating earnings for the year were $1.9 billion, or $3.99 per diluted share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $3.27 per share, in 2007. Excluding the benefit of $.23 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.0% for the year. That result was in line with our upwardly revised expectation of a 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of currency translation.
Total investments and cash at the end of December were $68.6 billion, or 20.1% higher than a year ago. The increase in total investments and cash resulted from solid cash flows to investments and a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate at the end of the year, compared with year-end 2007. However, these benefits were somewhat offset by the global widening of credit spreads, which produced lower fair values for debt securities that are classified as available for sale on the balance sheet. Gross unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available for sale were $4.1 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $3.1 billion at September 30, 2008, and $1.0 billion a year ago. Approximately $357 million of the increase in the gross unrealized loss from the end of the third quarter to the end of the fourth quarter on available-for-sale investments was attributable to the 13.8% strengthening of the yen to the dollar.
Shareholders' equity was $6.6 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $6.5 billion at September 30, 2008, and $8.8 billion a year ago. Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2008, included a net unrealized loss on investment securities of $1.2 billion, which primarily resulted from the widening of credit spreads, compared with a net unrealized loss of $882 million at September 30, 2008, and a net unrealized gain on investment securities of $874 million a year ago. The return on average shareholders' equity in the fourth quarter was 12.0%. On an operating basis, (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of SFAS 133 from net earnings and unrealized investment gains/losses in shareholders' equity) the return on average shareholders' equity was 24.0% for the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, the return on average shareholders' equity was 16.3%, and on an operating basis it was 24.2%.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 3.3% in the fourth quarter. Net investment income decreased ..5%. Investment income growth in yen terms was lowered by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 34% of Aflac Japan's fourth quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 2.3%. The benefit ratio improved over a year ago, and as a result, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 15.0% to 16.3%. Pretax operating earnings in yen increased 11.6%. For the year, premium income in yen increased 3.5%, and net investment income was unchanged. Total revenues were up 2.8%, and pretax operating earnings grew 8.4%.
 
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 was 96.55, or 17.3% stronger than the average rate of 113.24 in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year, the average exchange rate was 103.46 in 2008, or 14.0% stronger than the rate of 117.93 for the full year of 2007.
Benefiting from the stronger average yen in the fourth quarter, premium income in dollars increased 21.6% to $2.9 billion. Net investment income rose 17.1% to $546 million. Total revenues advanced 20.3% to $3.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $560 million, or 30.9% higher than a year ago. For the full year, Aflac Japan's results in dollar terms were also helped by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate. Premium income was $10.7 billion, up 18.1% from a year ago. Net investment income rose 14.0% to $2.1 billion. Total revenues were up 17.3% to $12.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $2.2 billion, or 23.6% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan sales declined .1% in the fourth quarter to 30.3 billion yen, or $316 million. For the year, total new annualized premium sales were up slightly to 114.7 billion yen, or $1.1 billion. Cancer insurance sales were strong in the fourth quarter, rising 20.3% and accounting for 36% of total new sales in the quarter. The sharp increase in cancer insurance sales primarily reflected our efforts at upgrading our existing coverage to the benefit levels of our newest cancer insurance product. Bank channel sales declined 26.8% in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter of 2008, to 959 million yen. We believe the decline was primarily attributable to the global financial crisis. During the fourth quarter, many banks initiated service calls to customers who had purchased other insurance companies' investment products through the banks. Those service calls took away from the time available to sell our products. At the end of 2008, Aflac Japan's products were available to customers of 242 banks. Sales of our cancer insurance product through the Japan Post Network Co. began in October 2008, and were 193 million yen, or .6% of total new sales in the fourth quarter.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 7.0% to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Net investment income increased .7% to $128 million. Total revenues rose 6.2% to $1.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings declined 5.5% to $160 million. For the year, premium income rose 8.5% to $4.3 billion. Net investment income increased .9% to $505 million. Total revenues were up 7.7% to $4.8 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 7.6% to $745 million.
The weak economy continued to pose challenges to our U.S. sales growth. Total new annualized premium sales were down 5.6% to $446 million in the fourth quarter. For the year, total new annualized premium sales decreased .4% to $1.6 billion. Although still a small contributor to total new sales, we were pleased to see strong life insurance sales in 2008. Life insurance sales rose 12.9% for the year and accounted for 6.2% of total new sales. We believe the improvement in life sales resulted from promoting life and health insurance bundles, which we initiated in April of 2008. Despite the sluggish sales results, we continued to make strides in expanding our sales force. During the fourth quarter, we recruited more than 6,000 new sales associates, an increase of 7.4% over the fourth quarter of 2007. The number of average producing sales associates rose .6% in the fourth quarter and 2.6% for the year.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's fourth quarter and full-year results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, I am pleased with our financial results and our accomplishments in 2008. It certainly proved to be a more challenging year than we anticipated due to continued economic deterioration. Even though we did not meet our annual sales objectives for Aflac Japan or Aflac U.S. in 2008, we continued to build on the strong foundations of our insurance operations. In Japan, we made major strides in diversifying and expanding our distribution system through the addition of the bank channel and the Japan Post Network Co. We also enhanced our product line to better meet the needs of consumers. In the United States, we produced steady growth in the number of new payroll accounts throughout the year, while also continuing to recruit and train new sales associates to further penetrate the vast U.S. market.
 
"I also remain very pleased with the quality and strength of our balance sheet. Although 2008 was marked by realized investment losses that were unusually high by Aflac standards, we believe our investment philosophy of matching our long-duration, yen-denominated liabilities with securities of comparable characteristics is the most prudent approach for us to take. That approach has served us very well in the past and we believe it will be effective in the future. We will also retain our conservative approach to managing our investment portfolio. At the end of the year, more than 98% of our total investments and cash were in fixed maturity securities or perpetual debentures. Of those securities, just 1.8% was rated below investment grade at year-end 2008.
"More than anything, we are intensely focused on our capital level. Despite the negative impacts of the stronger yen and realized investment losses, Aflac's capital position from a U.S. regulatory standpoint remained very strong. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio exceeded 450% at December 31, 2008. We do not anticipate a need for raising additional capital.
"Although we have a cautious outlook for sales in 2009 due to the current global economic uncertainty, we believe flat sales to a 5% increase in both Japan and the United States are reasonable targets for this year. However, our sales expectations could change if the U.S. and Japanese economies experience further deterioration. Importantly, our objective for 2009 operating earnings growth has not changed. Our goal is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 13% to 15% this year to $4.51 to $4.59 per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. However, the yen is currently stronger to the dollar than it was in 2008. If the stronger yen persists and averages 90 to 95 for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $4.73 to $4.96 per diluted share."

EXHIBIT INDEX:

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  April 29, 2009  Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
Total revenues, which benefited from a stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate than a year ago, rose 12.9% to $4.8 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in the first quarter of 2008. Net earnings were $569 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, compared with $474 million, or $.98 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the first quarter of 2009 included net realized investment losses of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, which reflected both after-tax realized investment gains and losses, compared with net realized losses in the first quarter of 2008 of $4 million, or $.01 per diluted share. Realized after-tax investment gains in the first quarter of 2009 of $146 million were generated to offset previously incurred investment losses for federal tax purposes. Realized after-tax investment losses in the first quarter of 2009 were $152 million.
Of the realized investment losses in the first quarter of 2009, approximately $74 million resulted from the impairment of certain collateralized debt obligations and $32 million was due to the impairment of the corporate bonds of two issuers: Security Benefit Life and Ford Motor Co. The company also realized $4 million of after-tax losses related to the impairment of certain collateralized mortgage obligations. In addition, the company realized $42 million of impairment losses on perpetual, or so-called "hybrid," securities of two issuers because their credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade in the first quarter of 2009.
The company has and will continue to follow the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) guidance contained in its letter dated October 14, 2008, regarding perpetual securities until the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) addresses the issue of whether a debt or equity method is most appropriate when evaluating perpetual securities for other-than-temporary-impairment charges under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In accordance with this guidance, the company evaluates its holdings of perpetual securities using a debt impairment method unless the security is downgraded to below investment grade, in which case the SEC guidance requires the company to use an equity impairment method. The debt impairment approach addresses the security issuer's ability to pay interest and redeem principal on a timely basis, whereas the equity impairment approach is based on an aging schedule of unrealized losses. For evaluating perpetual securities on a statutory accounting basis, the company continues to use the debt impairment approach as required under statutory accounting principles. The company's credit analysis suggests that both issuers of the perpetual securities that were impaired on a GAAP basis will be able to meet their contractual obligations for payment of interest and principal. As a result, no impairment charges will be recorded on a statutory accounting basis for these perpetual securities.
The impact on net earnings from the change in fair value of the interest rate component of the cross-currency swaps related to the company's senior notes, as required by SFAS 133, decreased net earnings by $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. The impact from SFAS 133 increased net earnings by $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2008. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2009 benefited from a gain of $10 million, or $.02 per diluted share from the extinguishment of parent company debt.
 
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the first quarter of 2009 were $568 million, compared with $475 million in the first quarter of 2008. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 24.5% to $1.22, compared with $.98 per share a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.09 for the first quarter. Excluding the benefit from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.3% in the first quarter.
The company early adopted the FASB Staff Positions on SFAS 157-4 and SFAS 115-2 in the first quarter. SFAS 157-4 addresses fair value measurements of assets, whereas SFAS 115-2 speaks to the determination and recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. The fair values of the company's investments were not materially affected by the adoption of the staff position on SFAS 157-4.
Total investments and cash at the end of March were $61.7 billion, or 1.7% lower than a year ago. The decrease in total investments and cash reflected the impact of the global widening of credit spreads on the company's long-duration portfolio, which produced lower fair values for debt securities that are classified as available for sale on the balance sheet. Gross unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available for sale were $5.9 billion at March 31, 2009, compared with $4.1 billion at December 31, 2008, and $1.9 billion a year ago.
Shareholders' equity was $5.2 billion at March 31, 2009, compared with $6.6 billion at December 31, 2008. Shareholders' equity at March 31, 2009, included a net unrealized loss on investment securities of $3.0 billion, which primarily resulted from the previously mentioned widening of credit spreads, compared with a net unrealized loss of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2008. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the first quarter was 38.4%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses, the impact of SFAS 133 and the gain from the extinguishment of debt from net earnings and unrealized investment gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 28.3% for the first quarter of 2009.
On April 15, 2009, Aflac Incorporated used internally generated cash flow to repay its $450 million senior notes and settle the related cross-currency, interest rate swaps that were used to convert the original dollar-denominated debt obligation into yen. The funds were transferred through a loan from the company's principal life insurance subsidiary, American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus, to Aflac Incorporated. The loan is an admitted asset on the insurance subsidiary's books under statutory accounting principles; and therefore, does not negatively impact the insurance company's risk-based capital ratio (RBC). This note has an annual interest rate of 7.13% and a term of three years with a provision for early repayment. The three-year term provides flexibility in accessing the external debt markets when conditions and interest costs improve.
 
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 3.6% in the first quarter. Net investment income increased .5%. Investment income growth in yen terms was lowered by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 34% of Aflac Japan's first quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 3.3%. The benefit ratio continued to improve and the operating expense ratio was slightly lower than a year ago. As a result, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 18.0% to 19.0%, and pretax operating earnings in yen increased 9.3%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2009 was 93.37, compared with an average rate of 105.06 in the first quarter of 2008. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms were enhanced as a result of the 12.5% strengthening of the average exchange rate during the quarter.
Premium income growth in dollar terms benefited from the stronger yen in the first quarter and rose 16.5% to $3.0 billion. Net investment income was up 12.9% to $560 million. Total revenues increased 16.2% to $3.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $681 million, or 22.9% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan sales declined .4% in the first quarter to 27.5 billion yen, or $293 million. Cancer insurance sales were solid, rising 7.4% and accounting for 34.3% of total new sales in the first quarter. The increase in cancer insurance sales primarily benefited from efforts to upgrade the coverage of existing policyholders to the benefit levels of Aflac Japan's newest cancer insurance product. Bank channel sales increased 265.6% to 1.0 billion yen in the first quarter, reflecting favorable comparisons to a year ago when bank channel sales began. On a sequential basis, bank channel sales rose 5.2% over the fourth quarter of 2008. At the end of March 2009, Aflac Japan's products were available to customers of 250 banks. Aflac Japan's objective for the full year is for sales to be flat to up 5% in yen terms.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 5.0% to $1.1 billion in the first quarter. Net investment income increased 1.4% to $125 million. Total revenues rose 4.7% to $1.2 billion. Pretax operating earnings were up 7.2% to $204 million.
Weak economic conditions continued to challenge Aflac's sales results in the United States. Total new annualized premium sales in the first quarter were down .6% to $351 million. Sales benefited from six additional production days in the first quarter. Without the additional days, sales would have been down approximately 6.5%. However, many sales indicators remained positive in the quarter. Newly established payroll accounts were up 9.9% over a year ago, suggesting Aflac's brand message and business-to-business efforts are reaching employers around the country. In addition, the Aflac U.S. distribution system expanded through new agent recruitment. During the first quarter, recruitment of 8,100 new sales associates was 25.0% higher than the first quarter of 2008. Importantly, the number of average weekly producing sales associates rose 2.4% in the first quarter to more than 11,100. Like Aflac Japan, the objective for Aflac U.S. is for sales to be flat to up 5% for the full year.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend of $.28 per share. The second quarter dividend is payable on June 1, 2009, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 20, 2009.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "The weakened economies in Japan and the United States continued to pose challenges for the sale of our products. However, we still sold more than 1.2 million policies during the first three months of this year, which generated more than $643 million of new annualized premiums. We are confident in our business model and remain convinced that the underlying need for our products in both countries is strong. We also believe we are well-positioned to meet consumers' needs.
 
"From a financial perspective, I am pleased with our start in 2009. Operating earnings per diluted share were consistent with our expectations and annual goal for 2009. Although net earnings reflected realized investment losses, those losses were manageable. Our ability to absorb the investment losses is a direct reflection of our capital position and the strength of our operation in terms of earnings and cash flow. We remain very focused on maintaining a strong capital position, especially on a regulatory basis. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio was 479% at March 31, 2009.
"As we assessed the changes to SFAS 157 and 115, we concluded we were in a good position to adopt the revised standards in the first quarter. Our investment portfolio's focus on a fairly limited number of asset classes gave us confidence we will meet the increased disclosure requirements by the time our first quarter Form 10-Q is filed with the SEC. Although the pricing of our investments was not materially affected by the new provisions of SFAS 157, we believe the changes to SFAS 115 support the notion of taking a longer view on the recovery of the fair value of an investment, which is consistent with the long- duration nature of our business.
"I continue to believe our overall investment approach of matching our long-duration, yen-denominated liabilities with securities of comparable characteristics is the most appropriate and prudent approach for us to take. Because our liability requirements have not changed, we do not intend to change our investment discipline. We will continue to purchase long-duration, investment grade, fixed-maturity securities when investing our sizeable investment cash flows. Although we have seen a global and significant downward move in credit ratings, 95% of our total debt investments and perpetual securities were rated investment grade at the end of the first quarter.
"Our sales outlook for this year remains cautious due to global economic uncertainty. At this point in the year, we continue to view flat sales to a 5% increase in both Japan and the United States as reasonable targets for 2009. However, we recognize that continued or further economic weakness would likely result in a need to revisit those targets.
"We also continue to believe our 2009 objective for operating earnings per share growth is reasonable and achievable. However, at this point in the year, it appears unlikely that we will repurchase any of our shares in 2009. As a result, we would expect operating earnings per diluted share to grow at the low end of our 13% to 15% target range this year, assuming the same average exchange rate as last year. An increase of 13% in operating earnings per diluted share would equal $4.51 in 2009, assuming 2008's average yen/dollar exchange rate of 103.46. If the yen averages 100 to 105 for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $4.47 to $4.59 per diluted share. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect second quarter operating earnings to be $1.11 to $1.14 per diluted share."

     (f) Each of the Company, American Family Life Assurance Company of New York ("Aflac NY"), and any subsidiary of the Company that would qualify as a "significant subsidiary" of the Company under Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X (each such subsidiary and Aflac NY, a "Designated Subsidiary") has not sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, which loss or interference would have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below), or would reasonably be expected to have a prospective Material Adverse Effect; and, since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the Pricing Prospectus, there has not been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its Designated Subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its Designated Subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus; the subsidiaries of the Company, other than the Designated Subsidiaries, considered in the aggregate as a single subsidiary, do not constitute a "significant subsidiary" as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X;

     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled
 
to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred
 
to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of
 
Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at 85 Broad Street, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attention: Registration Department; and to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., at 270 Park Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10017, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters'
 
Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
     17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
     18. 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
     19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
     20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
     21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters' imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
     If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

     (3) If the Issuer shall establish pursuant to Section 2.3 that the Securities of a series are to be issued in whole or in part in global form, then the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with this Section and the Order with respect to such series, authenticate and deliver one or more Securities in global form that (a) shall represent and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all of the Securities of such series issued and not yet canceled, (b) if such Securities are Registered Securities, shall be registered in the name of the Depositary for such Security or Securities in global form or the nominee of such Depositary, (c) if such Securities are Registered Securities, shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depositary or pursuant to such Depositary's instructions and (d) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect: "Unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive form, this Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to the nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary."

The Securities of each series shall bear interest, if any, from the date, and such interest shall be payable on the dates, established as contemplated by Section 2.3.
     The person in whose name any Registered Security of any series is registered at the close of business on any record date applicable to a particular series with respect to any interest payment date for such series shall be entitled to receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Registered Security subsequent to the record date and prior to such interest payment date, except if and to the extent the Issuer shall default in the payment of the interest due on such interest payment date for such series, in which case such defaulted interest shall be paid to the persons in whose names Outstanding Registered Securities for such series are registered at the close of business on a subsequent record date (which shall be not less than five Business Days prior to the date of payment of such defaulted interest) established by notice given by mail by or on behalf of the Issuer to the Holders of Registered Securities not less than 15 days preceding such subsequent record date. The term "record date" as used with respect to any interest payment date (except a date for payment of defaulted interest) for the Securities of any series shall mean the date specified as such in the terms of the Registered Securities of such series established as contemplated by Section 2.3, or, if no such date is so established, if such interest payment date is the first day of a calendar month, the fifteenth day of the next preceding calendar month or, if such interest payment date is the fifteenth day of a calendar month, the first day of such calendar month, whether or not such record date is a Business Day.
     Section 2.8 . (1) The Issuer will keep at each office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2 for each series of Securities a register or registers in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, it will provide for the registration of Registered Securities of such series and the registration of transfer of Registered Securities of such series. Such register shall be in written form in the English language. At all reasonable times such register or registers shall be open for inspection by the Trustee.
Registration, Transfer and Exchange
     (2) Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Registered Security or Registered Securities of the same series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
     Unregistered Securities (except for any temporary Unregistered Securities in global form) and Coupons (except for Coupons attached to any temporary Unregistered Securities in global form) shall be transferable by delivery.
     (3)     (a) At the option of the Holder thereof, Registered Securities of any series (other than a Registered Security in global form, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for a Registered Security or Registered Securities of such series having authorized denominations and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Registered Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer that shall
 
be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.2 and upon payment, if the Issuer shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
          (b) Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3, at the option of the Holder, Unregistered Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered Securities (if the Securities of such series are issuable in registered form) or Unregistered Securities (if Unregistered Securities of such series are issuable in more than one denomination and such exchanges are permitted by such series) of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.2, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of an Unregistered Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Unregistered Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Issuer and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Issuer and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any paying agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment as provided in Section 3.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any Unregistered Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any record date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant interest payment date, or (ii) any special record date for payment of defaulted interest and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related date for payment of defaulted interest, such Unregistered Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such interest or defaulted interest payment date or proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Unregistered Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the person so surrendering the Unregistered Security), and interest or defaulted interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Unregistered Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon, when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
          (c) Registered Securities of any series may not be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such series unless (i) otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3 and (ii) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that (A) the Issuer has received from the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date hereof, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that the inclusion of terms permitting Registered Securities to be exchanged for Unregistered Securities would result in no adverse Federal income tax effect to the Issuer or to any Holder. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities and Coupons surrendered upon any exchange or transfer provided for in this Indenture shall be canceled promptly and disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its procedures for the disposition of cancelled securities in effect as of the date of such cancellation.
     (4) All Registered Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by the Holder or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing.
     The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
     The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities of such
 
series to be redeemed or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
     (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.8, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a Registered Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
     If at any time the Depositary for any Registered Securities of a series represented by one or more Registered Securities in global form notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Registered Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Registered Securities shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.4, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary eligible under Section 2.4 with respect to such Registered Securities. If a successor Depositary eligible under Section 2.4 for such Registered Securities is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Issuer's election pursuant to Section 2.3 that such Registered Securities be represented by one or more Registered Securities in global form shall no longer be effective and the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form without Coupons, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registered Security or Securities in global form representing such Registered Securities in exchange for such Registered Security or Securities in global form.
     The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Registered Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Registered Securities in global form shall no longer be represented by a Registered Security or Securities in global form. In such event the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form without Coupons, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registered Security or Securities in global form representing such Registered Securities, in exchange for such Registered Security or Securities in global form.
     If specified by the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3 with respect to Securities represented by a Registered Security in global form, the Depositary for such Registered Security in global form may surrender such Registered Security in global form in exchange in whole or in part for Registered Securities of the same series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
          (a) to the Person specified by such Depositary a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Registered Security in global form; and
          (b) to such Depositary a new Registered Security in global form in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Registered Security in global form and the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (a) above.
     Upon the exchange of a Registered Security in global form for Registered Securities in definitive form without Coupons, in authorized denominations, such Registered Security in global form shall be canceled by the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer or the Trustee. Registered Securities in definitive form issued in exchange for a Registered Security in global form pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Registered Security in global form, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the
 
Trustee or an agent of the Issuer or the Trustee. The Trustee or such agent shall deliver such Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
     (6) All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
     (7) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the terms of any series of Securities to the contrary, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee (any of which, other than the Issuer, shall conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, on an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel) shall be required to exchange any Unregistered Security for a Registered Security if such exchange would result in adverse income tax consequences to the Issuer.
     (8) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Depositary Participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
     Section 2.9 . In case any Security or any Coupon appertaining to any Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer in its discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a new Security of the same series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date, bearing a number or other distinguishing symbol not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons appertaining to the Securities so mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen, or in exchange or substitution for the Security to which such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertained, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons so mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security or Coupon shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof and in the case of mutilation or defacement shall surrender the Security and related Coupons to the Trustee or such agent.
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
     Upon the issuance of any substitute Security or Coupon, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) or its agent connected therewith. In case any Security or Coupon which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same or the relevant Coupon (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security or Coupon), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Issuer and the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof.
     Every substitute Security or Coupon of any series issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security or Coupon is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be
 
subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities or Coupons of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities and Coupons shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and Coupons and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
     Section 2.10 . All Securities and Coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee or any agent of the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee or its agent for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be canceled by it; and no Securities or Coupons shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee or its agent shall dispose of canceled Securities and Coupons held by it in accordance with its procedures for the disposition of cancelled securities in effect as of the date of such cancellation. If the Issuer or its agent shall acquire any of the Securities or Coupons, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities or Coupons unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee or its agent for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof
     Section 2.11 . Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable as Registered Securities without Coupons, or as Unregistered Securities with or without Coupons attached thereto, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer with the concurrence of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof. Temporary Securities may contain such references to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Registered Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2 and, in the case of Unregistered Securities, at any agency maintained by the Issuer for such purpose as specified pursuant to Section 3.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series having authorized denominations and, in the case of Unregistered Securities, having attached thereto any appropriate Coupons. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series, unless otherwise established pursuant to Section 2.3. The provisions of this Section are subject to any restrictions or limitations on the issue and delivery of temporary Unregistered Securities of any series that may be established pursuant to Section 2.3 (including any provision that Unregistered Securities of such series initially be issued in the form of a single Unregistered Security in global form to be delivered to a Depositary or agency located outside the United States and the procedures pursuant to which Unregistered Securities in definitive or global form of such series would be issued in exchange for such temporary Unregistered Security in global form).
Temporary Securities
     Section 2.12 . Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
Global Securities
     Section 2.13 . The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so used by the Issuer, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification
CUSIP Numbers
provided
 
numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
     Section 3.1 . The Issuer covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, each of the Securities of such series (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) at the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities and in the Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto and in this Indenture. The interest on Securities with Coupons attached (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the several Coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they severally mature. If any temporary Unregistered Security provides that interest thereon may be paid while such Security is in temporary form, the interest on any such temporary Unregistered Security (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Security) shall be paid, as to the installments of interest evidenced by Coupons attached thereto, if any, only upon presentation and surrender thereof, and, as to the other installments of interest, if any, only upon presentation of such Securities for notation thereon of the payment of such interest, in each case subject to any restrictions that may be established pursuant to Section 2.3.
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest
     Section 3.2 . So long as any Securities are issued as Registered Securities, the Issuer will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where the Registered Securities of each series may be presented for payment, where the Securities of each series may be presented for exchange as is provided in this Indenture and, if applicable, pursuant to Section 2.3 and where the Registered Securities of each series may be presented for registration of transfer as in this Indenture provided.
Offices for Payments, Etc
     So long as any Securities are issued as Unregistered Securities, the Issuer will maintain one or more offices or agencies in a city or cities located outside the United States (including any city in which such an agency is required to be maintained under the rules of any shares exchange on which the Securities of such series are listed) where the Unregistered Securities, if any, of each series and Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto may be presented for payment. No payment on any Unregistered Security or Coupon will be made upon presentation of such Unregistered Security or Coupon at an agency of the Issuer within the United States nor will any payment be made by transfer to an account in, or by mail to an address in, the United States unless pursuant to applicable United States laws and regulations then in effect such payment can be made without adverse tax consequences to the Issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments in Dollars of Unregistered Securities of any series and Coupons appertaining thereto which are payable in Dollars may be made at an agency of the Issuer maintained in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, if such payment in Dollars at each agency maintained by the Issuer outside the United States for payment on such Unregistered Securities is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions.
     The Issuer will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Securities of any series, the Coupons appertaining thereto or this Indenture may be served.
     The Issuer will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of each such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. In case the Issuer shall fail to maintain any agency required by this Section, or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location of any of the above agencies, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
 
     The Issuer may from time to time designate one or more additional offices or agencies where the Securities of a series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may be presented for payment, where the Securities of that series may be presented for exchange as provided in this Indenture and pursuant to Section 2.3 and where the Registered Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer as in this Indenture provided, and the Issuer may from time to time rescind any such designation, as the Issuer may deem desirable or expedient; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Issuer of its obligation to maintain the agencies provided for in this Section. The Issuer will give to the Trustee prompt written notice of any such designation or rescission thereof.
     Section 3.3 . If the Issuer shall at any time act as its own paying agent, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust; Unclaimed Money
     Whenever the Issuer shall have one or more paying agents, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any Securities, deposit with the paying agent or paying agents a sum sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled to such principal, premium, if any, or interest, and, unless such paying agent is the Trustee, the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
     The Issuer will cause each paying agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such paying agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such paying agent will:
     (1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on Securities in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
     (2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Issuer (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal and premium, if any, or interest; and
     (3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent.
     The Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Order direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Issuer or such paying agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Issuer or such paying agent; and, upon such payment by any paying agent to the Trustee, such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent, or then held by the Issuer in trust for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on Order, or, if then held by the Issuer, shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such paying agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such paying agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published at least once, in an Authorized Newspaper in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or, in the case of Unregistered Securities, at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in London, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from
 
the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuer.
Section 3.4 . (1) The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer ending after the date hereof, a certificate, signed by the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signer thereof the Issuer is in default (without regard to periods of grace or requirements of notice) in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions hereof, and if the Issuer shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge.
Statements of Officers of Issuer as to Default; Notice of Default
     (2) The Issuer shall file with the Trustee written notice of the occurrence of any default or Event of Default within five Business Days of its becoming aware of any such default or Event of Default and set forth, in an Officer's Certificate, the details of such Event of Default or default and the action which the issuer proposes to take with respect thereto.
     Section 3.5 . Subject to Article IX, the Issuer will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises and those of each of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if its Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Issuer or the business of any Subsidiary and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
Existence
     Section 3.6 . The Issuer will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Issuer may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Issuer from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any such properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Issuer, desirable in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
Maintenance of Properties
     Section 3.7 . The Issuer shall pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges (including withholding taxes and any penalties, interest and additions to taxes) levied or imposed upon the Issuer or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary, and (2) all material lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which disputed amounts adequate reserves have been made.
Payment of Taxes and Other Claims
     Section 3.8 . Upon request of the Trustee or as otherwise necessary, the Issuer will execute and deliver such further instruments and perform such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Indenture.
Further Instruments and Acts
     Section 3.9 . The Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiary may not issue, assume, incur or guarantee any indebtedness for borrowed money secured by a Lien upon any shares of the Voting Shares of the Restricted Subsidiary which shares are owned by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary without effectively providing that the Securities (and if the Issuer so elects, any other indebtedness of the Issuer ranking on a parity with the Securities) shall be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, to the same extent and for so long as any such secured indebtedness is so secured. This Section 3.9 shall not apply to Liens upon any shares of Voting Shares of any Person existing at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and any extensions, renewals or replacements thereof.
Limitation on Liens
 
     Section 3.10 . As long as any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the Voting Shares of any Restricted Subsidiary, unless:
Limitations on Dispositions of Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries
     (1) the issuance, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition is required to comply with the order of a court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction, other than an order issued at the request of the Issuer or of one of its Restricted Subsidiary;
     (2) all of the Voting Shares of a Restricted Subsidiary then owned by the Issuer or by its Restricted Subsidiary is disposed of in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, for a consideration consisting of cash or other property the fair market value of which is at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of such Voting Shares;
     (3) the issuance, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition is made to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary;
     (4) any issuance, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition made in compliance with an order of a court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction; or

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may merge or consolidate any of its other Subsidiaries into or with another Person and it may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of its business in accordance with the provisions of Article IX. Furthermore, the foregoing covenant will not prohibit any issuance or disposition of securities by any other Subsidiary.
     Section 3.11 . The Issuer shall file with the Trustee, within 30 days after it files such annual and quarterly reports, information, documents and other reports with the Commission, copies of its annual report and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Issuer is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer's Certificates). The Trustee shall be under no obligation to analyze or make any credit decisions with respect to reports or other information received by it pursuant to this section, but shall hold such reports and other information solely for the benefit of, and review by, the security holders.
Commission Reports
     Section 3.12 . The Issuer shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods), if any, accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
Calculation of Original Issue Discount
 
     Section 4.1 . If and so long as the Trustee shall not be the Security registrar for the Securities of any series, the Issuer and any other obligor on the Securities will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee a list in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of the Registered Securities of such series pursuant to Section 312 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (1) semi-annually not more than 5 days after each record date for the payment of interest on such Registered Securities, as hereinabove specified, as of such record date and on dates to be determined pursuant to Section 2.3 for non-interest bearing Registered Securities in each year, and (2) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within thirty days after receipt by the Issuer of any such request as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such information is furnished.

     (2) default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days and the interest payment date has not been properly extended or deferred; provided, however, that if the Issuer is permitted by the terms of the Securities of the applicable series to defer the payment in question, the date on which such payment is due and payable shall be the date on which the Issuer is required to make payment following such deferral, if such deferral has been elected pursuant to the terms of the Securities of that series (subject to any deferral of any due date in the case of an Extension Period); or
     (3) default in the payment of any sinking fund installment as and when the same shall become due and payable by the terms of the Securities of such series; or

     (5) a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall have been entered adjudging the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary as bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, and such decree or order shall have continued undischarged and unstayed for a period of 120 days; or a decree or order of a court having jurisdiction in the premises for the appointment of a receiver or liquidator or trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or of its or their property, or for the winding up or liquidation of its or their affairs, shall have been entered, and such decree or order shall have remained in force and unstayed for a period of 120 days; or
     (6) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or consent to the appointment or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or similar official) of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its or their property, or make any general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall admit in writing its inability to pay its or their respective debts generally as they become due; or
     (7) a default, as defined in any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued, or by which there may be secured or evidenced, any Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than a default under this Indenture with respect to Securities of any series or a default with respect to any non-recourse Indebtedness), whether such Indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be created, shall happen and , which default (a) is caused by failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such Debt after giving effect to any grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such default ("Payment Default") or (b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
 
Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, totals U.S. $100,000,000 (or the equivalent thereof at the time of determination) or more in the aggregate, and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled, or such Indebtedness shall not have been discharged, within a period of 30 days after there has been given, by registered or certified United States mail, to the Issuer by the Trustee or to the Issuer and the Trustee by the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying such event of default and requiring the Issuer to cause such acceleration to be rescinded or annulled or to cause such Indebtedness to be discharged and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or
     (8) any other Event of Default provided in the supplemental indenture under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series; provided that if any such default or acceleration referred to in clause (7) above shall cease or be cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, then the Event of Default hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon cured.
     Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Article II, if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Sections 5.1(5) or 5.1(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by such Securityholders), may declare the principal of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Sections 5.1(5) or 5.1 (6) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable.
          At any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of , and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of that series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate per annum or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) expressed in the Securities of that series (or at the respective rates of interest or Yields to Maturity of all the Securities, as the case may be) to the date of such payment or deposit) and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 6.6, and (ii) any and all Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal on Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) that shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 5.10.
     For all purposes under this Indenture, unless otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities, if a portion of the principal of any Original Issue Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the principal amount of such Original Issue Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue Discount Securities.
 
     Section 5.2 . (1) The Issuer covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities of any series when such interest shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days or (b) in case default shall be made in the payment of all or any part of the principal of any of the Securities of any series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of such series or upon any redemption or by declaration or otherwise, then upon demand of the Trustee, the Issuer will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such series the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on all Securities of such series, and such Coupons, for principal or interest, as the case may be (with interest to the date of such payment upon the overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) specified in the Securities of such series); and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct.
Collection of Indebtedness by Trustee; Trustee May Prove Debt
     Until such demand is made by the Trustee, the Issuer may pay the principal of and interest on the Securities of any series to the registered holders, whether or not the Securities of such series be overdue.
     (2) In case the Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable.
     (3) In case there shall be pending proceedings relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor, or in case of any other comparable judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise:
          (a) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and interest (or, if the Securities of any series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of any series, and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, except caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct) and of the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor,
          (b) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the holders of the Securities of any series in any election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable proceedings, and
 
          (c) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the Securityholders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and any trustee, receiver, or liquidator, custodian or other similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Securityholders to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to the Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct.
     Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person.
     (4) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Securities of any series or Coupons appertaining to such Securities, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities or Coupons or the production thereof in any trial or other proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities in respect of which such action was taken.
     (5) In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities in respect to which such action was taken, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities parties to any such proceedings.
     Section 5.3 . Any moneys collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article in respect of any series shall be applied in the following order at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such moneys on account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the several Securities and Coupons appertaining to such Securities in respect of which monies have been collected and stamping (or otherwise noting) thereon the payment, or issuing Securities of such series in reduced principal amounts in exchange for the presented Securities of like series if only partially paid, or upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

     Section 5.4 . In case an Event of Default has occurred, has not been waived and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.
Suits for Enforcement
     Section 5.5 . In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Issuer and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.
Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of Proceedings
     Section 5.6 . No Holder of any Security of any series or of any Coupon appertaining thereto shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action or proceedings in its own name as trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby and the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such action or proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.9; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Security or Coupon with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of Securities of any series or Coupons appertaining to such Securities shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holder of Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders of Securities of the applicable series and Coupons appertaining to such Securities.

Unconditional Right of Securityholders to Institute Certain Suits
 
     Section 5.8 . Except as provided in Section 5.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities or Coupons is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Powers and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not Waiver of Default
     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of Securities or Coupons to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to Section 5.6, every power and remedy given by this Indenture or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities or Coupons may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities or Coupons.
     Section 5.9 . The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series affected at the time Outstanding shall have the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by this Indenture; provided that such direction shall not be otherwise than in accordance with law and the provisions of this Indenture; provided further that (subject to the provisions of Section 6.1) the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith by its board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or Responsible Officers of the Trustee shall determine that the action or proceedings so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or if the Trustee in good faith shall so determine that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such direction would be unduly prejudicial to the interests of Holders of the Securities of all series so affected not joining in the giving of said direction, it being understood that (subject to Section 6.1) the Trustee shall have no duty to ascertain whether or not such actions or forbearances are unduly prejudicial to such Holders.
Control by Holders of Securities
     Nothing in this Indenture shall impair the right of the Trustee in its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such direction or directions by Securityholders.
     Section 5.10 . Prior to the acceleration of the maturity of any Securities as provided in Section 5.1, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series at the time Outstanding with respect to which an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing may on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series waive any past default or Event of Default described in Section 5.1 and its consequences, except a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Security affected. In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all such Securities shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Waiver of Past Defaults
     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, and not to have occurred for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
     Section 5.11 . The Trustee shall, within ninety days after the occurrence of a default with respect to the Securities of any series, give notice of all defaults with respect to that series actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee (1) if any Unregistered Securities of that series are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof, by publication at least once an Authorized Newspaper in London and (2) to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, unless
Trustee to Give Notice of Default, but May Withhold in Certain Circumstances
 
in each case such defaults shall have been cured before the mailing or publication of such notice (the term "defaults" for the purpose of this Section being hereby defined to mean any event or condition which is, or with notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default); provided that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities of such series, or in the payment of any sinking fund installment on such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders of such series.
     Section 5.12 . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security or Coupon by his or her acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder or group of Securityholders of any series holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series, or, in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clause (4) or (8) of Section 5.1 (if the suit relates to Securities of more than one but less than all series), 10% in aggregate principal amount of Securities then Outstanding and affected thereby, or in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clause (4) or (8) (if the suit under clause (4) or (8) relates to all the Securities then Outstanding), (5), (6) or (7) of Section 5.1, 10% in aggregate principal amount of all Securities then Outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security on or after the due date expressed in such Security or any date fixed for redemption.
Right of Court to Require Filing of Undertaking to Pay Costs
     Section 6.1 . (1) With respect to the Holders of any series of Securities issued hereunder, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a particular series and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred with respect to such series, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise with respect to such series of Securities such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
Duties and Responsibilities of the Trustee; During Default; Prior to Default
     (2) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
          (a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect to such series which may have occurred:
               (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
               (ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements
 
of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein unless specifically required by this Indenture).
          (b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
          (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders pursuant to Section 5.9 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.
          (d) the Trustee shall not be required to take notice, and shall not be deemed to have notice, of any default or Event of Default hereunder, except Events of Default described in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of Section 5.1 hereof, unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall be notified specifically of the default or Event of Default on a written instrument or document delivered to it at its Corporate Trust Office, which such notice references the Securities and this Indenture, by the Issuer or by the Holders of at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities then Outstanding. In the absence of delivery of notice satisfying those requirements, the Trustee may assume conclusively that there is no default or Event of Default, except as noted.
     (3) None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is not reasonably assured to it.
     The provisions of this Section 6.1 are in furtherance of and subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
     Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

     (4) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the Securityholders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred therein or thereby;

     (12) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; and
 
     (13) in no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for special, indirect, or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, loss of profit) irrespective of whether the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

Right of Trustee to Rely on Officer's Certificate, Etc
 
desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering or omitting any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee, and such certificate, in the absence of negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee, shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

The Trustee for each series of Securities hereunder shall at all times be a corporation or banking association organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State or the District of Columbia having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000, and which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and is subject to supervision or examination by Federal, State or District of Columbia authority. Such corporation or banking association shall have a place of business or an affiliate with a place of business in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York if there be such a corporation or association in such location willing to act upon reasonable and customary terms and conditions. If such corporation or association publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation or association shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 6.10.
Persons Eligible for Appointment as Trustee
     The provisions of this Section 6.9 are in furtherance of and subject to Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
     Section 6.10 . (1) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer and (a) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, by giving notice of such resignation to the Holders thereof, by publication, at the Issuer's expense, at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and (b) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, by mailing notice of such resignation to the Holders thereof who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313(c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee and (c) by mailing notice of such resignation to the Holders of then Outstanding Registered Securities of each series affected at their addresses as they shall appear on the registry books. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor Trustee or Trustees. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition, at the Issuer's expense, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 5.12, on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor Trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor Trustee.
Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor Trustee
          (2) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
               (a) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to any series of Securities after written request therefor by the
 
Issuer or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or
               (b) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.9 and Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder; or
               (c) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
then, in any such case, the Issuer may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable series of Securities and appoint a successor Trustee for such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor Trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months may on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee.
     (3) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of such series and appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor Trustee so appointed and to the Issuer the evidence provided for in Section 7.1 of the action in that regard taken by such Securityholders.
     (4) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided in Section 6.11.
     Section 6.11 . Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.10 shall execute and deliver to the Issuer and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee with respect to all or any applicable series shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee for such series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer or of the successor Trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the Trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 3.3, pay over to the successor Trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights and powers. Any Trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such Trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee
     If a successor Trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental
 
indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be Trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.
     No successor Trustee with respect to any series of Securities shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9.
     Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor Trustee as provided in this Section 6.11, the Issuer shall give notice thereof (1) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof, by publication of such notice at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and (2) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313(c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, by mailing such notice to such Holders at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall make such information available to the Issuer for such purpose) and (3) if any Registered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof, by mailing such notice to such Holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the registry books. If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 6.10. If the Issuer fails to give such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee, the successor Trustee shall cause such notice to be given at the expense of the Issuer.
     Section 6.12 . Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be qualified under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee
     In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of such series or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities of any series in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
     Section 6.13 . The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, excluding any creditor relationship listed in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 to the extent indicated therein.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Issuer
     Section 6.14 . As long as any Securities of a series remain Outstanding, the Trustee may, by an instrument in writing, appoint with the approval of the Issuer an authenticating agent (the "Authenticating Agent") which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities, including Securities issued upon exchange, registration of transfer, partial redemption or pursuant to Section 2.9. Securities of each such series authenticated by such Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee. Whenever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities of any series by the Trustee or to the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent for such series and a Certificate of Authentication executed on behalf
Appointment of Authenticating Agent

Such Authenticating Agent shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 (determined as provided in Section 6.9 with respect to the Trustee) and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority.
     Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate agency business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent with respect to all series of Securities for which it served as Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent. Any Authenticating Agent may at any time, and if it shall cease to be eligible shall, resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Issuer.
     Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14 with respect to one or more series of Securities, the Trustee shall upon receipt of an Order appoint a successor Authenticating Agent and the Issuer shall provide notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 11.4. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent. The Issuer agrees to pay to the Authenticating Agent for such series from time to time reasonable compensation. The Authenticating Agent for the Securities of any series shall have no responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such at the direction of the Trustee.
     Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6 and 7.3 shall be applicable to any Authenticating Agent.
     Section 7.1 . Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders
     Section 7.2 . Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his or her agent or proxy may be proved in the following manner:
Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities
     (1) The fact and date of the execution by any Holder of any instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds or administer oaths that the person executing such instruments acknowledged to him or her the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn to before any such notary or other such officer. Where such execution is by or on behalf of any legal entity other than an individual, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of the authority of the person executing the same.
     (2) The fact of the holding by any Holder of an Unregistered Security of any series, and the identifying number of such Security and the date of his or her holding the same, may be proved by the
 
production of such Security or by a certificate executed by any trust company, bank, banker or recognized securities dealer wherever situated satisfactory to the Trustee, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state that on the date thereof a Security of such series bearing a specified identifying number was deposited with or exhibited to such trust company, bank, banker or recognized securities dealer by the person named in such certificate. Any such certificate may be issued in respect of one or more Unregistered Securities of one or more series specified therein. The holding by the person named in any such certificate of any Unregistered Securities of any series specified therein shall be presumed to continue for a period of one year from the date of such certificate unless at the time of any determination of such holding (a) another certificate bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Securities shall be produced, or (b) the Securities of such series specified in such certificate shall be produced by some other person, or (c) the Securities of such series specified in such certificate shall have ceased to be Outstanding. Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the fact and date of the execution of any such instrument and the amount and numbers of Securities of any series held by the person so executing such instrument and the amount and numbers of any Security or Securities for such series may also be proven in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee for such series or in any other manner which the Trustee for such series may deem sufficient.
     (3) In the case of Registered Securities, the ownership of such Securities shall be proved by the Security register or by a certificate of the Security registrar.
     The Issuer may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders of Registered Securities of any series entitled to vote or consent to any action referred to in Section 7.1, which record date may be set at any time or from time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of any adjournment or reconsideration) not more than 60 days nor less than five days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and thereafter, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, with respect to Registered Securities of any series, only Holders of Registered Securities of such series of record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or revoke such vote or consent.
     Section 7.3 . The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and, subject to the provisions of this Indenture, interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Holder of any Unregistered Security and the Holder of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Unregistered Security or Coupon (whether or not such Unregistered Security or Coupon shall be overdue) for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes and neither the Issuer, the Trustee, nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such person, or upon his or her order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Unregistered Security or Coupon.
Holders to Be Treated as Owners
     Section 7.4 . In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the
Securities Owned by Issuer Deemed Not Outstanding
 
Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described Persons; and, subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
     Section 7.5 . At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 7.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor or on registration of transfer thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.
Right of Revocation of Action Taken
     Section 8.1 . (1) In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by this Indenture, the Issuer, when authorized by a resolution of its Board of Directors (which resolution may provide general terms or parameters for such action and may provide that the specific terms of such action may be determined in accordance with or pursuant to an Order), and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto, which comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as then in effect, without the consent of the Holders, for one or more of the following purposes:

          (c) to add to the covenants of the Issuer such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions as the Issuer shall consider to be for the benefit of the Holders of Securities or Coupons, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; provided, that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such an Event of Default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to waive such an Event of Default;
 
          (d) to cure any ambiguity, inconsistency, omission or defect to any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture;
          (e) to establish the forms or terms of Securities of any series or of the Coupons appertaining to such Securities as permitted by Sections 2.1 and 2.3;
          (f) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series and to add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.11; and
          (g) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder of affected Securities in any material respect.
     (2) The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Issuer in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained and to accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage or pledge of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

     Section 8.2 . (1) With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article VII) of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of all series affected by such supplemental indenture voting separately, the Issuer and the Trustee may, from time to time and at any time, enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto, which comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each such series or of the Coupons appertaining to such Securities; provided, that no such supplemental indenture shall (a) extend the final maturity of any then issued Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof, or make the principal thereof (including any amount in respect of original issue discount), or interest thereon payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in such Securities and any Coupons thereon or in accordance with the terms thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of a then issued Original Issue Discount Security that would be due and payable upon an acceleration of the maturity thereof pursuant to Section 5.1 or the amount thereof provable in bankruptcy pursuant to Section 5.2, or impair or affect the right of any Securityholder to institute suit for the payment thereof or, if such Securities provide therefor, any right of repayment at the option of the Securityholder, in each case without the consent of the Holder of each Security so affected, or (b) reduce the percentage in principal amount of then issued Securities of any series, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the Holders of each Security so affected.
Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Securityholders
     (2) A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of Holders of Securities of such series, or of Coupons appertaining to such Securities, with respect to such covenant or provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series or of the Coupons appertaining to such Securities.
     (3) Upon the request of the Issuer, accompanied by, accompanied by the Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders of the Securities as aforesaid and other documents, if any, required by Section 7.1, the Trustee shall join with the
 
Issuer in the execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such supplemental indenture.
     (4) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
     (5) Promptly after the execution by the Issuer and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall give notice thereof (a) if any Registered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof by mailing a notice thereof by first-class mail to such Holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the Security register, (b) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313 (c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, by mailing a notice thereof by first-class mail to such Holders at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee and (c) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to all Holders thereof, by publication of a notice thereof at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in London, and such notice shall set forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture. Any failure of the Issuer to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
     Section 8.3 . Upon the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions hereof, this Indenture shall be and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of Securities of each series affected thereby shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments, and all the terms and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.
Effect of Supplemental Indenture
     Section 8.4 . The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall be given, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article VIII complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.
Documents to Be Given to Trustee
     Section 8.5 . Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article may bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee for such series as to any matter provided for by such supplemental indenture or as to any action taken by Securityholders. If the Issuer or the Trustee shall so determine, new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may be prepared by the Issuer, authenticated by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Securities of such series then Outstanding.

If pursuant to Section 2.3 provision is made for either or both of (1) Legal Defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 10.4 or (2) Covenant Defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 10.5, then the provisions of such Section or Sections, as the case may be, together with the provisions of Sections 10.6 through 10.9 inclusive, with such modifications thereto as may be specified pursuant to Section 2.3 with respect to any Securities, shall be applicable to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, and the Issuer may at its option by or pursuant to Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, elect to have Section 10.4 (if applicable) or Section 10.5 (if applicable) be applied to such Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article.
Applicability of Legal Defeasance Provisions; Issuer's Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
     Section 10.4 . Upon the Issuer's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Issuer shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto as provided in this Section on and after the
Legal Defeasance and Discharge
 
date the conditions set forth in Section 10.6 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 10.7 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clause (2) of this Section and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 10.6(a) and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 3.2 and 3.3, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Issuer may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 10.5 applied to such Securities. Following a legal Defeasance, payment of such Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.
     Section 10.5 . Upon the Issuer's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Issuer shall be released from its obligations under Article IX, Sections 3.7 and 3.10, inclusive, and any covenants provided pursuant to Sections 2.3(18), 8.1(c) or 8.1(e) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 5.1(4) (with respect to any of Article IX, Sections 3.7 and 3.10, inclusive, and any such covenants provided pursuant to Sections 2.3(18), 8.1(c) or 8.1(e)) and 5.1 (8) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 10.6 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Issuer may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 5.1(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
Covenant Defeasance
     Section 10.6 . The following shall be the conditions to the application of Section 10.4 or Section 10.5 to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, and any Coupons appertaining thereto:
Conditions to Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
          (a) The Issuer shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee which satisfies the requirements contemplated by Section 6.9 and agrees to comply with the provisions of this Article applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefits of the holders of such Securities, (A) money in an amount, or (B) Government Obligations which through the scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, (X) the principal of and any premium and interest and (Y) any mandatory sinking fund payments applicable to such Securities on the day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto. Before such a deposit the Issuer may make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the redemption of Securities at a future date or dates in accordance with Article XII which shall be given effect in applying the foregoing.
 
          (b) In the event of an election to have Section 10.4 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the holders of such Securities, and any Coupons appertaining thereto, will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit, Legal Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit, Legal Defeasance and discharge were not to occur.
          (c) In the event of an election to have Section 10.5 apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the holders of such Securities will not recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to such Securities and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur.
          (d) The Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that it has been informed by the relevant securities exchange(s) that neither such Securities nor any other Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit.
          (e) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 5.1(5) and 5.1(6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day).
          (f) Such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement, to which the Issuer is a party or by which it is bound.
          (g) The Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.
     Such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be imposed on the Issuer in connection therewith as contemplated by Section 2.3.
     Section 10.7 . Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 3.3, all money and U.S. Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant to Section 2.3) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 10.6 in respect of any Securities of any series and any Coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any paying agent (including the Issuer acting as its own paying agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

Indemnity For U.S. Government Obligations
     Section 10.10 . If the Trustee or the paying agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or government authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Issuer has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 10.4 or 10.5 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or paying agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 10.7 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Issuer makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.
Reimbursement
     Section 11.1 . No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture, or in any Security, or because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor, either directly or through the Issuer or any successor, under any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance of the Securities and the Coupons appertaining thereto by the Holders thereof and as part of the consideration for the issue of the Securities and the Coupons appertaining thereto.
Incorporators, Shareholders, Officers and Directors of Issuer Exempt from Individual Liability
     Section 11.2 . Nothing in this Indenture, in the Securities or in the Coupons appertaining thereto, expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties hereto and their successors and the Holders of the Securities or Coupons, if any, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture or under any covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their successors and of the Holders of the Securities or Coupons, if any.
Provisions of Indenture for the Sole Benefit of Parties and Holders of Securities and Coupons
     Section 11.3 . All the covenants, stipulations, promises and agreements in this Indenture contained by or in behalf of the Issuer shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.
Successors and Assigns of Issuer Bound by Indenture
     Section 11.4 . Any notice or demand which by any provision of this Indenture is required or permitted to be given or served by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities or Coupons to or on the Issuer shall be in writing (which may be by facsimile) and may be given or served by being deposited postage prepaid, first-class mail (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) addressed (until another address of the Issuer is filed by the Issuer with the Trustee) to Aflac Incorporated, 1932 Wynnton Road, Columbus, Georgia 31999, Attn: General Counsel. Any notice, direction, request or demand by the Issuer or any Holder of Securities or Coupons to or upon the Trustee shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given or served by being deposited postage prepaid, first-class mail (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) addressed (until another address of the Trustee is filed by the Trustee with the Issuer) to The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 900 Ashwood Parkway, Suite 425, Atlanta, GA, 30338, Attn: Corporate Trust Administration.
Notices and Demands on Issuer, Trustee and Holders of Securities and Coupons
 
     Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Registered Securities, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) by electronic means or in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder entitled thereto, at his or her last address as it appears in the Security register. In any case where notice to such Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
     In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the Issuer when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.
     Section 11.5 . Upon any application or demand by the Issuer to the Trustee to take any action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.
Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel; Statements to Be Contained Therein
     Each certificate or opinion provided for in this Indenture and delivered to the Trustee with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include (1) a statement that the person making such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition, (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such certificate or opinion are based, (3) a statement that, in the opinion of such person, he or she has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him or her to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with and (4) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such person, such condition or covenant has been complied with.
     Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by counsel, unless such officer knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, information with respect to which is in the possession of the Issuer, upon the certificate, statement or opinion of or representations by an officer or officers of the Issuer, unless such counsel actually knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
     Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Issuer, unless such officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the accounting matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
     Any certificate or opinion of any independent firm of public accountants filed with and directed to the Trustee shall contain a statement that such firm is independent.
 
     Section 11.6 . If the date of maturity of interest on or principal of the Securities of any series or any Coupons appertaining thereto or the date fixed for redemption or repayment of any such Security or Coupon shall not be a Business Day, then payment of interest or principal need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date of maturity or the date fixed for redemption, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date.
Payments Due on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays
     Section 11.7 . If and to the extent that any provision of this Indenture limits, qualifies or conflicts with the duties imposed by, or with another provision (an "incorporated provision") included in this Indenture by operation of, Sections 310 to 318, inclusive, of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, such imposed duties or incorporated provision shall control.
Conflict of Any Provision of Indenture with Trust Indenture Act of 1939
     Section 11.8 . This Indenture and each Security and Coupon shall be deemed to be a contract under the laws of the State of New York, and for all purposes shall be construed in accordance with the laws of such State, except as may otherwise be required by mandatory provisions of law.

     EACH OF THE ISSUER AND THE TRUSTEE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS INDENTURE, THE NOTES OR THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

Unless otherwise specified in an Officer's Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 2.3 of this Indenture with respect to a particular series of Securities, whenever for purposes of this Indenture any action may be taken by the Holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of Securities of all series or all series affected by a particular action at the time Outstanding and, at such time, there are Outstanding Securities of any series which are denominated in a coin or currency other than Dollars (including ECUs), then the principal amount of Securities of such series which shall be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of taking such action shall be that amount of Dollars that could be obtained for such amount at the Market Exchange Rate. For purposes of this Section 11.11, Market Exchange Rate shall mean the noon Dollar buying rate in New York City for cable transfers of that currency as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; provided, however, in the case of ECUs, Market Exchange Rate shall mean the rate of exchange determined by the Commission of the European Communities (or any successor thereto) as published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (such publication or any successor publication, the "Journal"). If such Market Exchange Rate is not available for any reason with respect to such currency, the Trustee shall use, in its sole discretion and without liability on its part, such quotation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or, in the case of ECUs, the rate of exchange as published in the Journal, as of the most recent available date, or quotations or, in the case of ECUs, rates of exchange from one or more major banks in The City of New York or in the country of issue of the currency in question, which for purposes of the ECU shall be Brussels, Belgium, or such other quotations or, in the case of ECU, rates of exchange as the Trustee shall deem appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply in determining the equivalent principal amount in respect of Securities of a series denominated in a currency other than Dollars in connection with any action taken by Holders of Securities pursuant to the terms of this Indenture including without limitation any determination contemplated in Section 5.1(7).
Securities in a Foreign Currency or in ECU
     All decisions and determinations of the Trustee regarding the Market Exchange Rate or any alternative determination provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive to the extent permitted by law for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Issuer and all Holders.
 
     Section 11.12 . The Issuer agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (1) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of or interest on the Securities of any series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered, unless such day is not a Business Day, then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the Business Day preceding the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered and (2) its obligations under this Indenture to make payments in the Required Currency (a) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with subsection (1)), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (b) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable and (c) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Indenture.
Judgment Currency
     Section 11.13 . If any provision of this Indenture or of the Securities, or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of this Indenture or of the Securities, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to whom or which it is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Separability Clause
     Section 11.14 . In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
Force Majeure
     Section 12.1 . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article
     Section 12.2 . Notice of redemption to the Holders of Registered Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Issuer shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Securities of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the registry books. Notice of redemption to the Holders of Unregistered Securities to be redeemed as a whole or in part shall be given by electronic means. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
 
     The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall identify the securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers), shall specify, the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities and, in the case of Securities with Coupons attached thereto, of all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
     The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's request and provision of the notice information, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer.
     On or before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.3) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee at least 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed. In case of a redemption at the election of the Issuer prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, prior to the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders pursuant to this Section, an Officer's Certificate stating that such restriction has been complied with.
     If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such Series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
     Section 12.3 . If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto shall be void, and, except as provided in Sections 3.3 and 6.5, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, together with all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that payment of interest becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable in the case of Securities with Coupons attached thereto, to the Holders of the Coupons for such interest upon surrender thereof, and
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
 
in the case of Registered Securities, to the Holders of such Registered Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Sections 2.3 and 2.7 hereof.
     If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by such Security.
     If any Security with Coupons attached thereto is surrendered for redemption and is not accompanied by all appurtenant Coupons maturing after the date fixed for redemption, such Security may be redeemed after deducting from the redemption price any amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Issuer and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any paying agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the redemption price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that interest represented by Coupons shall be payable as provided in Section 2.9 and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3, only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons.
     Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
     Section 12.4 . Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.
Exclusion of Certain Securities from Eligibility for Selection for Redemption
     Section 12.5 . (1) The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of the Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of the Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "sinking fund payment date".
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
     (2) In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
     (3) On or before the 30th day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate (which need not contain the statements required by Section 11.5) (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series and the basis for such credit, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating
 
that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such Officer's Certificate (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such Officer's Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such 30th day, to deliver such Officer's Certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
     (4) If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) or a lesser sum in Dollars (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) if the Issuer shall so request with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) or less and the Issuer makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 12.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for redemption under this Section if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 30 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such Officer's Certificate as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer (or the Issuer, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 12.2 (and with the effect provided in Section 12.3) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity.
     (5) On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
     (6) The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or give any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the giving of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have
 
received from the Issuer a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article V and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.10 or the default cured on or before the 30th day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
 
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to be duly executed as of the date first set forth above.

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 4.2
 
 
     THIS FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE is made as of the 21st day of May, 2009, by and between AFLAC INCORPORATED, a Georgia corporation, as issuer (the "Company"), and THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"):
     WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore entered into a Senior Indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Original Indenture"), with the Trustee;
     WHEREAS, the Original Indenture is incorporated herein by this reference and the Original Indenture, as supplemented by this First Supplemental Indenture, is herein called the "Indenture";
     WHEREAS, under the Original Indenture, a new series of senior notes may at any time be established by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Original Indenture and the terms of such series may be described by a supplemental indenture executed by the Company and the Trustee;
     WHEREAS, the Company proposes to create under the Indenture a new series of senior notes;
     WHEREAS, additional senior notes of other series hereafter established, except as may be limited in the Original Indenture as at the time supplemented and modified, may be issued from time to time pursuant to the Indenture as at the time supplemented and modified, and all senior notes issued by the Company of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise so provided, may be reopened for issuances of additional senior notes of such series; and
     WHEREAS, all things necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this First Supplemental Indenture and make it a valid and binding agreement of the Company, in accordance with its terms, have been done.
     NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.01 . There is hereby established a new series of senior notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's 8.500% Senior Notes due 2019 (the "Senior Notes").
Establishment
     There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $850,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of the Original Indenture and the terms of this First Supplemental Indenture; provided,
 
however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in an Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated). Any such additional Senior Notes and the Senior Notes established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.

     The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
     Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.
Section 1.02 . The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.
Definitions
     "Global Security" means, with respect to any series of securities, a security authenticated and delivered under the Original Indenture executed by the Company and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instruction, all in accordance with the Original Indenture, which shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.
     "Interest Payment Date" means May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2009.
     "Original Issue Date" means May 21, 2009.
     "Regular Record Date" means, with respect to each Interest Payment Date, the close of business on the preceding May 1 or November 1, as the case may be.
     "Stated Maturity" means May 15, 2019.
Section 1.03 . The principal of the Senior Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity. The unpaid principal amount of the Senior Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 8.500% per year until paid or duly provided for, such interest to accrue from May 21, 2009 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing November 15, 2009, to the Person in whose
Payment of Principal and Interest
 
name the Senior Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity of principal or on a Redemption Date as provided herein will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Regular Record Date and may be paid as provided in Section 2.7 of the Original Indenture.
     Payments of interest on the Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
     Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.
Section 1.04 . The Senior Notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Denominations
Section 1.05 . The Senior Notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary (which initially shall be The Depository Trust Company) or its nominee. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Senior Notes represented by Global Securities will not be exchangeable for, and will not otherwise be issuable as, Senior Notes in definitive form. The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee.
Global Securities
     Owners of beneficial interests in such Global Securities will not be considered the holders thereof for any purpose under the Indenture, and no Global Security representing a Senior Note shall be exchangeable, except for another Global Security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee or
 
to a successor Depositary or its nominee. The rights of holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the Depositary.
     A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.
Section 1.06 . No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, but payment will be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
Transfer
Section 1.07 . The provisions of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 of the Original Indenture will apply to the Senior Notes.
Defeasance
Section 1.08 . The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 50 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such Redemption Date.
Redemption at the Option of the Company
     "Treasury Rate" means (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.
 
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their successors or, if any of such firms is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
Section 1.09 . The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price.
Notice to Trustee

     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of senior notes of the Company issued and issuable in one or more series under a Senior Indenture dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "First Supplemental Indenture," and together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures incidental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes issued thereunder and of the terms upon which said Senior Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Senior Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof as 8.500% Senior Notes due May 15, 2019 (the "Senior Notes"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $850,000,000, provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, as provided in the First Supplemental Indenture. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
     This Note is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form only as provided in the Indenture.
     If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
     The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Senior Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
     The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Note and (b) restrictive covenants and the related Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note.
     The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be
 
redeemed and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 50 basis points, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such Redemption Date.
     "Treasury Rate" means (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the Redemption Date.
     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes.
     "Independent Investment Banker" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their successors or, if any of such firms is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
     "Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer
 
and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
     "Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
     Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but no more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of the Senior Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
     The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
     If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall determine, in such manner as it deems appropriate and fair, the principal amount of such notes held by each beneficial owner of such Senior Notes to be redeemed. The Trustee may select notes and portions of notes in amounts of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.
     No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
     As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Senior Notes, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
     Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Securities on behalf of the Company ("Paying Agent") and the Security registrar of the Company or the Trustee may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is
 
registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
     The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
     No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule, law statute or constitutional provision, or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof.
     Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

EXHIBIT INDEX:

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  July 29, 2009  Aflac Incorporated today reported its second quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, but higher realized investment losses, total revenues were basically flat at $4.3 billion during the second quarter of 2009, compared with a year ago. Net earnings were $314 million, or $.67 per diluted share, compared with $483 million, or $1.00 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the second quarter of 2009 included after-tax realized investment losses of $249 million, or $.53 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $1 million, or nil per share in the second quarter of 2008. Of the realized investment losses in the second quarter of 2009, $104 million resulted from the impairment of Aflac's holdings in CIT, which were sold at the impaired book value subsequent to the conclusion of the second quarter. Two fixed-maturity securities of Kommunalkredit were also impaired in the quarter, totaling $51 million. The company also realized $2 million of after-tax losses related to the impairment of certain collateralized mortgage obligations and $1 million of realized investment gains from other transactions. In addition, the company realized $93 million of impairment losses on perpetual, or so-called "hybrid," securities of two issuers. The impairment loss on the hybrid securities was determined using the equity impairment method under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) because their credit ratings are below investment grade. No impairment charges will be recorded on a statutory accounting basis for these perpetual securities because Aflac's credit analysis suggests that both issuers of the perpetual securities that were impaired on a GAAP basis will be able to meet their contractual obligations for payment.
We believe that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of Aflac's underlying profitability drivers. We define operating earnings as the profits we derive from our operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from SFAS 133, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of our business is in Japan, where our functional currency is the Japanese yen, we believe it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. We translate Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate the balance sheet using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency as a financial reporting issue for Aflac and not as an economic event to our company or shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of our operations, we also encourage readers of our financial statements to evaluate our financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $562 million, compared with $487 million in the second quarter of 2008. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 18.8% to $1.20, compared with $1.01 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.05 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 13.9%.
 
Results for the first six months of 2009 also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues rose 6.1% to $9.1 billion, compared with $8.6 billion in the first half of 2008. Reflecting higher realized investment losses, net earnings were $882 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, compared with $957 million, or $1.98 per share, for the first six months of 2008. Operating earnings for the first six months of 2009 were $1.1 billion, or $2.42 per diluted share, compared with $962 million, or $1.99 per share, in 2008. Excluding the benefit of $.14 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.6% for the first six months of 2009.
Total investments and cash at the end of June were $65.6 billion, compared with $61.7 billion at March 31, 2009. The increase in total investments and cash reflected improvement in the fair values of the company's investments, compared with invested asset values at the end of the first quarter. In addition, the fair values of the company's investments at the end of June also benefited from a stronger end-of-period yen/dollar exchange rate, compared with March 31, 2009. Gross unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available for sale were $4.9 billion at June 30, 2009, compared with $5.9 billion at March 31, 2009.
Shareholders' equity was $6.4 billion at June 30, 2009, compared with $5.2 billion at March 31, 2009. Shareholders' equity at June 30, 2009, included a net unrealized loss on investment securities of $2.1 billion, compared with a net unrealized loss of $3.0 billion at the end of March 2009. Shareholders' equity per share was $13.58 at the end of the second quarter of 2009, compared with $11.12 per share at the end of the first quarter of 2009. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the second quarter was 21.7%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses, and the impact of SFAS 133 from net earnings and unrealized investment gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 27.0% for the second quarter of 2009.
AFLAC JAPAN
In the second quarter, Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 2.5%. Premium income in yen rose 3.1%, and net investment income declined .2%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 34% of Aflac Japan's second quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, net investment income was up 2.3% in the quarter. Due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 18.2% to 19.7%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 10.7%. For the first six months, premium income in yen increased 3.3%, and net investment income was up .2%. Total revenues were up 2.9%, and pretax operating earnings grew 10.0%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the second quarter of 2009 was 97.53, or 7.1% stronger than the average rate of 104.50 in the second quarter of 2008. For the first six months, the average exchange rate was 95.44, or 9.8% stronger than the rate of 104.77 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the second quarter and first six months were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 10.7% to $2.9 billion in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 7.2% to $544 million. Total revenues increased 10.1% to $3.5 billion. Pretax operating earnings advanced 18.6% to $679 million. For the first six months, premium income was $5.9 billion, or 13.6% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 10.0% to $1.1 billion. Total revenues were up 13.1% to $7.0 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $1.4 billion, or 20.7% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales increased 5.0% to 30.1 billion yen, or $309 million in the second quarter. For the first six months, total new premium sales were up 2.3% to 57.6 billion yen, or $602 million. The increase in second quarter sales primarily reflected the favorable consumer response to a recently introduced insurance product. Due to the strong initial sales of our new child endowment product, ordinary life insurance sales rose 38.7% in the second quarter. In addition, sales through the bank channel continued to improve. In the second quarter, bank channel sales rose 106.4%, compared with a year ago, to a record 1.4 billion yen. Bank channel sales were 39.0% higher than the first quarter of 2009.
 
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues rose 2.7% to $1.2 billion in the second quarter. Premium income increased 2.8% to $1.1 billion, and net investment income was up 1.8% to $127 million. Pretax operating earnings were $198 million, an increase of 4.0%. For the first six months, total revenues were up 3.7% to $2.5 billion. Premium income rose 3.9% to $2.2 billion. Net investment income increased 1.6% to $252 million. Pretax operating earnings rose 5.6% to $402 million.
Very weak economic conditions in the United States continued to influence total new annualized premium sales. In the second quarter, total new sales declined 10.9% to $341 million. For the six months, total new sales were $692 million, or 6.0% lower than a year ago. Like the first quarter however, growth of new payroll accounts remained solid. Newly established payroll accounts rose 9.6% in the second quarter. In addition, new agent recruitment also remained strong. Newly recruited agents increased 14.9% during the second quarter to more than 7,800.
PURCHASE OF CONTINENTAL AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY
Today Aflac also announced its planned acquisition of Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC) for $100 million. The purchase will be funded with internal capital, and the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2009. CAIC, which is currently privately owned and headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina, specializes in offering voluntary group insurance products that are distributed by insurance brokers at the worksite. CAIC is rated A- (Excellent) by A.M. Best. Based on statutory accounting statements filed with the state insurance departments, CAIC produced total revenues of $79 million and net income of $7 million in 2008. At the end of 2008, CAIC's admitted assets were $104 million and capital and surplus was $33 million. After anticipated integration expenses, the company expects the purchase to be modestly accretive to 2010 consolidated earnings.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.28 per share is payable on September 1, 2009, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 19, 2009.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's second quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Despite the very challenging global economic environment, I continue to be pleased with our overall financial performance so far this year. Operating earnings per diluted share remain consistent with our expectations and annual objective for 2009. Net earnings again reflected larger-than-usual realized investment losses. However, our strong financial position and capital generation enabled us to absorb these losses, while still maintaining a strong risk-based capital ratio. Although our statutory financial statements for the first half of the year are not yet final, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio was 459% at June 30, 2009, compared with 479% at the end of March.
"Reflecting the ongoing uncertainly of the global economy, our overall sales outlook for this year remains cautious. Yet based on our year-to-date sales results in Japan, we believe we are still positioned to achieve Aflac Japan's objective for sales to be flat to up 5% for the full year. With sales down in the United States for the first half of the year, it is unlikely that Aflac U.S. will generate positive sales growth in 2009. However, we remain encouraged about our long-term sales opportunities in both markets. We are convinced the underlying need for our products in Japan and the United States remains strong. At the same time, we are confident in our business model.
"In fact, our strong belief in Aflac's business model is what led us to invest in our U.S. operation. While Continental American Insurance Company is small from a financial perspective, we believe it brings distinct value and potential to Aflac U.S. Aflac will gain access to an attractive portfolio of voluntary group worksite products that complement the individually issued insurance products we have sold at worksites for more than 50 years. Acquiring the capabilities to develop, price and administer voluntary group products will also help us better advance our insurance broker distribution initiative, while at the same time, continuing to meet the needs of our rapidly growing sales force of individual sales associates.
 
"Our objective for 2009 remains an increase of 13% to 15% in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency. An increase of 13% in operating earnings per diluted share would equal $4.51 in 2009, assuming 2008's average yen/dollar exchange rate of 103.46. If the yen averages 95 to 100 for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $4.59 to $4.73 per diluted share. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect third quarter operating earnings to be $1.19 to $1.22 per diluted share. For 2010, our objective remains a 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of the yen/dollar exchange rate."
For more than 50 years, Aflac products have given policyholders the opportunity to direct cash where it is needed most when a life-interrupting medical event causes financial challenges. As the number one provider of guaranteed-renewable insurance in the United States and the number one insurance company in terms of individual insurance policies in force in Japan, Aflac insurance products provide protection to more than 40 million people worldwide.

EXHIBIT INDEX:

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  October 28, 2009  Aflac Incorporated today reported its third quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, total revenues rose 22.6% to $4.5 billion during the third quarter of 2009, compared with a year ago. Net earnings were $363 million, or $.77 per diluted share, compared with $100 million, or $.21 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the third quarter of 2009 included after-tax realized investment losses of $226 million, or $.48 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $389 million, or $.81 per share in the third quarter of 2008. Of the realized investment losses in the third quarter of 2009, $212 million resulted from impairment losses on perpetual, or so-called "hybrid," securities of four issuers. The impairment loss on the perpetual securities was determined using the equity impairment method because their credit ratings are below investment grade. No impairment charges will be recorded on a statutory accounting basis for these perpetual securities because Aflac's credit analysis suggests that the issuers of the perpetual securities that were impaired on a GAAP basis will be able to meet their contractual obligations for payment. The company also realized investment losses of $22 million from the impairment of a collateralized debt obligation and $5 million primarily from the impairment of collateralized mortgage obligations. In addition, the company realized $13 million of investment gains from sales and redemptions of investment securities.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815 (or hedging activities, formerly referred to as SFAS 133), and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $589 million, compared with $493 million in the third quarter of 2008. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 22.5% to $1.25, compared with $1.02 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.09 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 13.7%.
 
Results for the first nine months of 2009 also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues rose 11.1% to $13.7 billion, compared with $12.3 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, or $2.66 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $2.19 per share, for the first nine months of 2008. Operating earnings for the first nine months of 2009 were $1.7 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $3.02 per share, in 2008. Excluding the benefit of $.23 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 13.9% for the first nine months of 2009.
Total investments and cash at the end of September 2009 were $71.6 billion, compared with $65.6 billion at June 30, 2009. The increase in total investments and cash reflected a stronger yen at the end of the period and improvement in the fair values of the company's investments, compared with invested asset values at the end of the second quarter of 2009. Gross unrealized losses on investment securities classified as available for sale were $3.8 billion at September 30, 2009, compared with $4.9 billion at June 30, 2009.
Shareholders' equity was $7.9 billion at September 30, 2009, compared with $6.4 billion at June 30, 2009. Shareholders' equity at September 30, 2009, included a net unrealized loss on investment securities of $1.1 billion, compared with a net unrealized loss of $2.1 billion at the end of June 2009. Shareholders' equity per share was $16.85 at the end of the third quarter of 2009, compared with $13.58 per share at the end of the second quarter of 2009. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the third quarter was 20.4%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses, the impact of ASC 815 on net earnings, and unrealized investment gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 27.0% for the third quarter of 2009.
AFLAC JAPAN
In the third quarter, Aflac Japan's premium income in yen rose 3.4%, and net investment income declined 2.0%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 33% of Aflac Japan's third quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Excluding the impact of the stronger yen, net investment income increased 2.9% in the quarter. Total revenues in yen were up 2.6%. Due to continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 18.3% to 20.0%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 11.8%. For the first nine months, premium income in yen increased 3.4%, and net investment income was down .6%. Total revenues were up 2.8%, and pretax operating earnings grew 10.6%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2009 was 93.56, or 15.1% stronger than the average rate of 107.70 in the third quarter of 2008. For the first nine months, the average exchange rate was 94.79, or 11.6% stronger than the rate of 105.75 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the third quarter and first nine months of the year were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 18.9% to $3.1 billion in the third quarter. Net investment income was up 12.7% to $568 million. Total revenues increased 18.0% to $3.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings advanced 28.7% to $725 million. For the first nine months of the year, premium income was $9.0 billion, or 15.4% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 10.9% to $1.7 billion. Total revenues were up 14.7% to $10.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $2.1 billion, or 23.4% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales increased 6.5% to 30.0 billion yen, or $320 million in the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2009, total new annualized premium sales were up 3.7% to 87.5 billion yen, or $922 million. The increase in third quarter sales reflected strong results in the medical and ordinary life insurance product categories. Although Aflac Japan's revised medical product was just introduced in late August, the initial response from consumers was very positive. As a result, medical sales rose 13.8% in the third quarter. The ordinary life category was again led by strong child endowment sales. In addition, sales through the bank channel continued to improve. Bank channel sales in the third quarter rose 66.1%, compared with a year ago, to a record 2.2 billion yen.
 
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 3.0% to $1.1 billion, and net investment income was down 4.4% to $123 million. Total revenues rose 2.2% to $1.2 billion in the third quarter. Pretax operating earnings were $216 million, an increase of 5.7%. For the first nine months of the year, premium income rose 3.6% to $3.3 billion. Net investment income declined .4% to $375 million. Total revenues were up 3.2% to $3.7 billion, and pretax operating earnings rose 5.6% to $617 million.
Aflac U.S. total new annualized premium sales continued to reflect weak economic conditions in the United States. In the third quarter, total new sales declined 7.2% to $342 million. For the nine months, total new sales were $1.0 billion, or 6.4% lower than a year ago. However, growth in the number of new payroll accounts remained strong and encouraging. Newly established payroll accounts rose 15.0% in the third quarter and 11.5% for the first nine months of the year. New agent recruitment also remained solid. Newly recruited agents rose 9.4% during the third quarter to more than 7,000. For the first nine months, new agent recruitment was 16.4% higher than a year ago.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend. The fourth quarter dividend of $.28 per share is payable on December 1, 2009, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2009.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's third quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "I continue to be encouraged by our financial and operating performance so far this year, especially in light of the weak economic conditions. Although net earnings continued to reflect larger-than-usual realized investment losses, the losses in the third quarter were significantly lower than a year ago. In addition, Aflac's operating earnings growth was again robust and consistent with our objective for the year. I am also very pleased that our overall capital position remained strong. Despite pressure from credit rating downgrades on some of our investments, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio was 405% at the end of September, which exceeds our internal target.
"We remain cautious on the outlook for new sales in the United States due to ongoing economic weakness. It's clear that Aflac U.S. new annualized premium sales will fall short of our annual objective of flat to 5% growth this year. However, through new agent recruitment, effective training programs and new payroll account growth, we continue to believe we are positioning Aflac U.S. for a better sales year in 2010. In our largest market, we believe Aflac Japan will achieve its annual objective of flat sales to a 5% increase for the full year. With a tremendous consumer response to our recently introduced products and continued growth through the bank channel, we also believe we can extend Aflac Japan's sales momentum into 2010. Overall, we have great confidence in our business model and in the need for our products in Japan and the United States.
"We are also confident we will achieve our 2009 objective of a 13% to 15% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency. If the yen averages 90 to 95 to the dollar in the last three months of the year, we would expect reported operating earnings to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.16 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. Under that scenario, we would expect full-year operating earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.83. For 2010, our objective remains a 9% to 12% increase in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of the yen/dollar exchange rate. Although we are keenly focused on achieving our 2009 and 2010 earnings targets, our primary objective is to maintain a strong balance sheet that our customers and owners can rely on in this challenging environment."

EXHIBIT INDEX:

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  November 24, 2009  Aflac Incorporated announced today that the Lloyds Banking Group plc has accepted the exchange of two of its investment securities owned by Aflac. The exchange offer program was announced by Lloyds on November 3, 2009, and the exchanges are expected to settle on December 1, 2009.
When the transaction settles, Aflac will have exchanged its investment in Lloyds TSB Bank plc yen-denominated, Upper Tier II perpetual securities (par value of $222 million at September 30, 2009) into yen-denominated, Lower Tier II fixed-maturity securities. The company will also have exchanged its holdings of Bank of Scotland plc yen-denominated, Upper Tier II perpetual securities (par value of $188 million at September 30, 2009) into yen-denominated, Lower Tier II fixed-maturity securities. The newly issued securities are enhanced capital notes, which convert to common equity if the published Lloyds Banking Group's consolidated core Tier I capital ratio falls below 5%.
Previously, the company had communicated its expectation to book an impairment charge of $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, $32 million of which was related to the impairment of one of its Lloyds holdings. As a result of the securities exchanges announced today, which are considered to be sales and purchases of assets, Aflac now expects to incur an estimated after-tax realized investment loss of $66 million on two of its Lloyds holdings in the fourth quarter of 2009. The realized loss of $66 million will be reflected in the company's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and statutory accounting statements.
Aflac did not exchange its HBOS plc yen-denominated, Upper Tier II perpetual securities (par value of $471 million at September 30, 2009). In addition, the company continues to hold Lloyds Banking Group dollar-denominated, Tier I perpetual securities (par value of $33 million at September 30, 2009). The Lloyds Tier I instruments owned by Aflac were not included in the exchange offer. The company expects the coupon payments on the Lloyds Tier I securities to be suspended. However, the coupons on the HBOS securities are not discretionary and as a result, Aflac expects to continue to receive coupon payments on its HBOS investment.
Commenting on the securities exchanges, Aflac Incorporated President and Chief Financial Officer Kriss Cloninger III stated, "We are very pleased with these securities exchanges. As we have repeatedly discussed, our primary objective is to maintain a strong capital position. In that regard, our analysis suggested that exchanging these two securities will modestly benefit our risk-based capital ratio."

The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement, dated December 14, 2009, among the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. The Company anticipates using the net proceeds from the sale of these Notes for debt repayment and general corporate purposes.
     The Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.900% per annum and mature on December 17, 2039. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 17 and December 17 each year, beginning on June 17, 2010. The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date; plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.
     The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a second supplemental indenture, dated as of December 17, 2009 (the "Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including, among other things, nonpayment, failure to comply with the other agreements in the Indenture for a period of 90 days, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization.
     The description of the Indenture set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the Base Indenture, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 21, 2009, and the Supplemental Indenture (including the form of Notes included therein), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

provided, however
     6. (a) The Company represents and agrees that, other than the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof, without the prior consent of the Representatives, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a "free writing prospectus" as defined in Rule 405 under the Act; each Underwriter represents and agrees that, without the prior consent of the Company and the Representatives, other than one or more term sheets relating to the Securities containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of Securities, it has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that would constitute a free writing prospectus; and any such free writing prospectus the use of which has been consented to by the Company and the Representatives (including the final term sheet prepared and filed pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof) is listed on Schedule II(a) hereto.

provided
however
     7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise specifically provided for in this Section. It is understood, however, that, except as provided in this Section, and Sections 9 and 12 hereof, the Underwriters will pay all of their own costs and expenses, including the fees of their counsel, transfer taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them, and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.
     8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements
 
of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:
     (a) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act within the applicable time period prescribed for such filing by the rules and regulations under the Act and in accordance with Section 5(a) hereof; the final term sheet contemplated by Section 5(a) hereof, and any other material required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, shall have been filed with the Commission within the applicable time periods prescribed for such filings by Rule 433; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission and no notice of objection of the Commission to the use of the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) under the Act shall have been received; no stop order suspending or preventing the use of the Prospectus or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus shall have been initiated or threatened by the Commission; and all requests for additional information on the part of the Commission shall have been complied with to your reasonable satisfaction;
     (b) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, counsel for the Underwriters, shall have furnished to you such written opinion or opinions, dated the Time of Delivery, with respect to such matters as you may reasonably request, and such counsel shall have received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to enable them to pass upon such matters. In rendering such opinion, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP may rely as to matters of Georgia law upon the opinion of Joey M. Loudermilk, Esq., referred to in Section 8(d) hereof;

     (f) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by
 
reference in the Pricing Prospectus any loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Pricing Prospectus there shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any change, or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs, management, financial position, shareholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Pricing Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in clause (i) or (ii), is in your judgment so material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus;
     (g) On or after the Applicable Time (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating accorded the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act, and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities or the Company's financial strength or claims paying ability;

     9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled
 
to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
     (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred
 
to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
     (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
     10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
     (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of
 
Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
     11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
     12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
     13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly.
     All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282, Attention: Registration Department; and to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., at 270 Park Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10017, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex
provided
however
 
constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
     In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
     14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
     15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
     16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate.

Section 1.01 . There is hereby established a new series of senior notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's 6.900% Senior Notes due 2039 (the "Senior Notes").
Establishment
     There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $400,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of
 
the Original Indenture and the terms of this Second Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in a Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated). Any such additional Senior Notes and the Senior Notes established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.

     The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
     Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.
Section 1.02 . The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.
Definitions
     "Global Security" means, with respect to any series of securities, a security authenticated and delivered under the Original Indenture executed by the Company and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instruction, all in accordance with the Original Indenture, which shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.
     "Interest Payment Date" means June 17 and December 17 of each year, commencing on June 17, 2010.
     "Regular Record Date" means, with respect to each Interest Payment Date, the close of business on June 1 or December 1 immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.
     "Stated Maturity" means December 17, 2039.
Section 1.03 . The principal of the Senior Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity. The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes, and any overdue installment of interest thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall bear interest at the rate of 6.900% per year until paid or made available for payment, such interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from December 17, 2009.
Payment of Principal and Interest
 
Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on June 17, 2010, to the Person in whose name the Senior Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity of principal or on a Redemption Date as provided herein will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Regular Record Date and may be paid as provided in Section 2.7 of the Original Indenture.
     Payments of interest on the Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
     Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.
Section 1.04 . The Senior Notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Denominations
Section 1.05 . The Senior Notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary (which initially shall be The Depository Trust Company) or its nominee.

The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee.

denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee or to a successor Depositary or its nominee. The rights of holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the Depositary.
     A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.
Section 1.06 . No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, but payment will be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
Transfer

The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Second Supplemental Indenture or of the Senior Notes.

EXHIBIT INDEX:

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  February 2, 2010  Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Total revenues benefited from the strengthening of the yen to the dollar in the fourth quarter and rose 7.9% to $4.6 billion, compared with $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Net earnings were $251 million, or $.53 per diluted share, compared with $197 million, or $.42 per share, a year ago.
Aflac Incorporated's fourth quarter and full-year results included the fourth quarter results of Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC), which was acquired by Aflac on October 1, 2009. CAIC's results were immaterial to Aflac's consolidated fourth quarter and full-year results, and were reflected in the Aflac U.S. reporting segment.
Net earnings in the fourth quarter included after-tax realized investment losses of $307 million, or $.65 per diluted share, compared with losses of $262 million, or $.56 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008. Of the realized investment losses in the fourth quarter of 2009, $126 million resulted from impairment losses on three perpetual securities. The impairment losses were determined using the equity impairment method, which is required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for perpetual securities whose credit ratings are below investment grade. No impairment charges were recorded on a statutory accounting basis for these perpetual securities because Aflac's credit analysis indicates the issuers of the perpetual securities that were impaired on a GAAP basis will be able to meet their contractual obligations for payment. Realized investment losses in the fourth quarter also included charges of $110 million for the impairment of the company's holdings of Takefuji Corp., a Japanese consumer finance company, and $7 million for the impairment of other securities. In addition, the company incurred net realized investment losses of $64 million from sales and redemptions, which primarily reflected the previously announced exchange of two Lloyds Banking Group securities.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815 (or hedging activities, formerly referred to as SFAS 133), and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
 
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $558 million, compared with $458 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 20.4% to $1.18, compared with $.98 a year ago. The operating tax rate in the fourth quarter declined following completion of an examination by the Internal Revenue Service, which benefited operating earnings by $24 million, or $.05 per diluted share. In addition, the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.03 during the quarter.
Results for the full year also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues rose 10.3% to $18.3 billion, compared with $16.6 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $1.5 billion, or $3.19 per diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $2.62 per share, in 2008. Operating earnings for the full year of 2009 were $2.3 billion, or $4.85 per diluted share, compared with $1.9 billion, or $3.99 per share, in 2008. Excluding the benefit of $.26 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.0% for the year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and the previously mentioned benefit from a reduction in taxes, operating earnings per diluted share rose 13.8% for the year.
Total investments and cash at the end of December 2009 were $73.2 billion, compared with $71.6 billion at September 30, 2009. The increase in total investments and cash primarily resulted from improvement in the fair values of the company's investments since the end of the third quarter of 2009.
Shareholders' equity was $8.4 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $7.9 billion at September 30, 2009. Shareholders' equity at the end of the year included a net unrealized loss on investment securities of $640 million, compared with a net unrealized loss of $1.1 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2009. Shareholders' equity per share was $17.96 at the end of the year, compared with $16.85 per share at September 30, 2009. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the fourth quarter was 12.3%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of ASC 815 on net earnings, and unrealized investment gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 24.7% for the fourth quarter of 2009.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 3.3% in the fourth quarter. Net investment income rose 1.2%. Investment income growth in yen terms was restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 32% of Aflac Japan's fourth quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 3.4%. The benefit ratio improved over a year ago, and as a result, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 16.3% to 18.7%. Pretax operating earnings in yen rose 18.5% in the fourth quarter. For the year, premium income in yen grew 3.3%, and net investment income was down .1%. Total revenues were up 3.0%, and pretax operating earnings increased 12.4%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 89.70, or 7.6% stronger than the average rate of 96.55 in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, the average exchange rate was 93.49, or 10.7% stronger than the rate of 103.46 in 2008.
Reflecting a benefit from the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate in the fourth quarter, premium income in dollars increased 10.7% to $3.2 billion. Net investment income rose 8.5% to $592 million. Total revenues were $3.8 billion, an increase of 10.8%. Pretax operating earnings climbed 27.6% to $714 million. For the full year, Aflac Japan's results in dollar terms also benefited from the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate. Premium income rose 14.1% to $12.2 billion. Net investment income increased 10.3% to $2.3 billion. Total revenues were up 13.7% to $14.5 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $2.8 billion, an increase of 24.4% over a year ago.
 
Aflac Japan total new annualized premium sales rose significantly in the fourth quarter, increasing 14.9% to 34.8 billion yen, or $388 million. For the year, total new sales were up 6.7% to 122.3 billion yen, or $1.3 billion. Sales of medical insurance were exceptionally strong, rising 57.7% in yen in the fourth quarter. The tremendous increase in medical policy sales reflected the successful promotion of Aflac Japan's revised medical product that was launched in August 2009. Stand-alone medical was the number one product category in the fourth quarter, accounting for 43% of total new sales. Ordinary life insurance sales also remained strong and primarily reflected favorable consumer reception to the child endowment product that was introduced in March 2009. Ordinary life sales rose 45.0% in yen in the fourth quarter. Aflac Japan's total new premium sales also benefited from continued improvement of sales through the bank channel. Bank channel sales were a record 2.9 billion yen in the fourth quarter, rising 33.3% from the third quarter and 202.7% over the fourth quarter of 2008. At the end of 2009, more than 350 banks had agreements to offer Aflac products to their customers.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 5.2% to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Net investment income declined 3.1% to $124 million. Total revenues rose 4.3% to $1.3 billion. As a result of higher benefit and expense ratios in the quarter, pretax operating earnings declined 1.5% to $158 million. For the year, premium income was up 4.0% to $4.4 billion. Net investment income declined 1.1% to $499 million. Total revenues were $5.0 billion, up 3.5% from a year ago. Pretax operating earnings rose 4.1% to $776 million.
As expected, Aflac U.S. sales growth was again challenged by weak economic conditions. Total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter were down 6.3% to $419 million. For the year, total new sales declined 6.4% to $1.5 billion. In addition to the weak economy, fourth quarter sales were impacted by the loss of a large payroll account. However, the sales contribution of the newly acquired Continental American Insurance Company (CAIC) largely offset this impact. Sales through CAIC, recently rebranded as Aflac Group Insurance, were $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. New agent recruitment slowed somewhat in the fourth quarter, although recruitment was 10.6% higher for the full year. New payroll account growth also remained strong, rising 7.4% in the fourth quarter and 10.6% for the year.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the first quarter cash dividend. The first quarter cash dividend of $.28 per share is payable on March 1, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2010.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's fourth quarter and full-year results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Despite the discouraging economic backdrop during 2009, Aflac emerged with a very solid year from a financial perspective. Growth of operating earnings per diluted share was in line with our goal of a 13% to 15% increase before the impact of foreign currency. In fact, 2009 was the 20 consecutive year in which we've met our earnings objective. We generated significant growth during that 20-year period, reflecting the strength of our insurance operations.
th
"Aflac Japan in particular had a great 2009. We successfully launched new products last year, which contributed significantly to our strong sales results, exceeding our objective for the year. We also continued to make strides in expanding our distribution system. In 2009, we experienced strong agency recruitment and increased the number of banks that are offering our products to their customers. 2009 also marked our 35 year of operating in Japan, and we were pleased that we could commemorate our anniversary by achieving a major milestone: Surpassing 20 million individual insurance policies in force in Japan. We were especially proud to have reached that milestone a year earlier than we had expected.
th
 
"As we discussed throughout 2009, sales growth in the United States proved to be sensitive to the very weak economic conditions. As a result, Aflac U.S. fell short of its sales target in 2009. However, we remain convinced that the underlying need for our products has not changed. Furthermore, we still believe the sales opportunities in the United States are vast. As such, we continued to strengthen our U.S. operations last year through new product introductions, new agent recruitment, intensified training, payroll account growth and targeted advertising that continues to clarify exactly how our products help consumers and employers. We also added to our product and distribution capabilities with the acquisition of CAIC, now called Aflac Group Insurance. As we look ahead, we believe we can leverage this new group product platform in the insurance broker market, while also helping our existing sales force gain better access to the large payroll account market.
"We maintained a high level of confidence in the quality of our balance sheet in 2009. We believed then, and continue to believe today, that our investment approach of effectively matching assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach for our policyholders and shareholders. More than anything, we have been intensely focused on assessing our capital level. Despite the negative impact of realized investment losses and credit rating downgrades on some investments we hold, Aflac's capital position from a U.S. regulatory standpoint remained strong in 2009. In addition, we enhanced the capital position of our principal life insurance subsidiary at the end of 2009 with a $500 million contribution from the parent company. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate that our risk-based capital ratio exceeded 475% at December 31, 2009, which included approximately 40 percentage points from the capital contribution.
"As we look to sales opportunities in 2010, we believe it makes sense to remain cautious. Economies around the globe appear to be recovering, but the timing of full recovery remains uncertain. As such, we have set targets of flat sales to a 5% increase in both our U.S. and Japanese operations. Our objective for 2010 operating earnings growth remains unchanged. Our goal is to increase operating earnings per share 9% to 12% this year to $5.29 to $5.43 per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 90 to 95 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $5.24 to $5.56 per diluted share."

99.1
 

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  April 27, 2010  Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
Total revenues benefited from the strengthening of the yen to the dollar in the first quarter and rose 5.1% to $5.1 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2009. Net earnings were $636 million, or $1.35 per diluted share, compared with $569 million, or $1.22 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the first quarter included after-tax realized investment losses of $30 million, or $.06 per diluted share, compared with losses of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. Of the realized investment losses in the first quarter of 2010, $27 million resulted from equity method impairment losses on two perpetual securities. No impairment charges were recorded on a statutory accounting basis for these perpetual securities because Aflac's credit analysis indicates the issuers will be able to meet their contractual obligations for payment. In addition, the company realized investment losses of $50 million from the sale of securities, with the sale of the company's holdings of Takefuji accounting for $49 million of that amount. The company also realized investment gains of $36 million in the first quarter from various securities transactions. Also included in realized investment gains/losses was a gain of $11 million from valuing foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps on certain variable interest entities that were required to be consolidated following adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, effective January 1, 2010.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815 (or hedging activities), and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses, the impact from ASC 815, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $666 million, compared with $568 million in the first quarter of 2009. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.41, compared with $1.22 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.05 during the quarter.
Total investments and cash at the end of March 2010 were $74.0 billion, compared with $73.2 billion at December 31, 2009. The increase in total investments and cash primarily resulted from improvement in the fair values of the company's investments since the end of 2009.
Shareholders' equity was $9.0 billion at March 31, 2010, compared with $8.4 billion at December 31, 2009. Shareholders' equity at the end of the first quarter included a net unrealized loss on investment securities and derivatives of $392 million, compared with a net unrealized loss of $640 million at the end of 2009. Shareholders' equity per share was $19.14 at March 31, 2010, compared with $17.96 per share at December 31, 2009. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the first quarter was 29.2%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact from ASC 815 on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 28.9% for the first quarter of 2010.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 3.3% in the first quarter. Net investment income rose 2.5%. Investment income growth in yen terms was restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 32% of Aflac Japan's first quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 3.6%. The benefit ratio improved from a year ago, and as a result, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 19.0% to 21.4%. Pretax operating earnings in yen rose 16.8% in the first quarter.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2010 was 90.49, or 3.2% stronger than the average rate of 93.37 in the first quarter of 2009.
Reflecting a benefit from the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter, premium income in dollars increased 6.5% to $3.2 billion. Net investment income rose 5.8% to $593 million. Total revenues were $3.8 billion, an increase of 6.9%. Pretax operating earnings climbed 20.5% to $821 million.
Aflac Japan produced strong sales in the first quarter. Total new annualized premium sales rose 10.0% to 30.3 billion yen, which was a record for first quarter sales. In dollar terms, total new annualized premium sales were $334 million. The strong sales performance primarily reflected the favorable consumer response to the revision of EVER, Aflac Japan's market-leading medical product. Medical insurance was the top selling product category in the first quarter, accounting for 37% of total new sales and increasing 21.4% over the first quarter of 2009. Sales of ordinary life insurance also remained very strong and were primarily driven by the child endowment product. Ordinary life sales rose 64.4% in yen in the first quarter. Aflac Japan's total new premium sales also benefited from continued sales growth through the bank channel. Bank channel sales were a record 3.1 billion yen in the first quarter, increasing 6.5% over the fourth quarter of 2009 and 206.6%, compared with the first quarter of 2009.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 3.5% to $1.1 billion in the first quarter. Net investment income rose 5.6% to $132 million. Total revenues were up 3.7% to $1.3 billion. As expected, the benefit ratio declined sharply. The improvement in the benefit ratio reflected higher policy terminations resulting from the loss of a large payroll account and the release of the related policy reserves. Although the improvement in the benefit ratio was somewhat offset by higher expenses, the pretax profit margin increased from 16.6% to 19.1% in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the termination of that large payroll account, the pretax profit margin would have been 16.0%. Pretax operating earnings advanced 19.4% to $244 million.
Aflac U.S. sales growth continued to be challenged by weak economic conditions. In addition, the first quarter of 2010 had five fewer production days than the first quarter of 2009. As a result, total new annualized
premium sales in the first quarter declined 10.0% to $316 million. Sales through Aflac Group Insurance were $13 million in the first quarter of 2010. Recruitment of new sales associates was down sharply, primarily reflecting tough comparisons to record recruiting in the first quarter of 2009. Compared with the fourth quarter 2009, however, new agent recruitment was up 6.9%.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter cash dividend of $.28 per share is payable on June 1, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 19, 2010.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are pleased with our overall results in the first quarter of 2010. As we expected, we continued to see strong sales growth in our largest operating segment, Aflac Japan. At the same time, we were not surprised by continued sales weakness in the U.S. market in light of ongoing economic challenges. However, we posted strong consolidated financial results, and earnings-per-share growth was again consistent with our expectation and objective.
"We remain confident in the quality of our balance sheet. Furthermore, we did not experience significant credit rating downgrades of our investments in the quarter. We are especially pleased with our capital position, and our capital generation in the quarter was strong. Realized investment losses in the first quarter declined from the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result, we estimate that Aflac's risk-based capital ratio exceeded 525% at March 31, 2010, compared with 479% at the end of 2009.
"With one quarter of the year complete, we continue to believe we are positioned for another year of solid financial performance. Although challenges posed by weak economic conditions clearly persist, particularly in the United States, we still believe our goal for increasing operating earnings per diluted share is reasonable and attainable. As such, our goal remains an increase of 9% to 12% this year in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 90 to 95 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $5.24 to $5.56 per diluted share. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect second quarter operating earnings to be $1.33 to $1.38 per diluted share."

EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  June 28, 2010  Aflac Incorporated announced today that it has sold its holdings of Greek sovereign debt and reduced its investment exposure to perpetual, or so-called "hybrid," securities through two separate transactions.
The company sold its entire holdings of Greek sovereign debt, which totaled $270 million of par value at March 31, 2010. As a result of the sale, the company will incur a realized after-tax investment loss of approximately $67 million on a generally accepted accounting basis (GAAP) in its second quarter financial statements.
The company also exchanged a perpetual, Upper Tier II security of a European issuer for a higher-rated, fixed maturity, senior debt instrument. In addition, the company further reduced its perpetual Upper Tier II holdings through a privately negotiated transaction with another European issuer. The company expects these two transactions to result in a realized after-tax gain of approximately $80 million on a GAAP basis in the second quarter. In addition, these two transactions lowered the company's exposure to perpetual securities by $725 million of par value, or 8.4% of total perpetual securities at March 31, 2010.
Commenting on the securities transactions, Aflac Incorporated President and Chief Financial Officer Kriss Cloninger III stated, "It is our time-tested investment approach to carefully assess the credit quality of our portfolio and our investment concentrations on an ongoing basis. As a result of extensive credit analysis, we believed it was prudent to trim our exposures to Eurozone sovereign debt. As we've done in the past, we also concluded it was in our best interest to take advantage of opportunities to selectively reduce our holdings of perpetual securities.
"Although these transactions resulted in losses on a statutory accounting basis, we estimate they will add approximately 20 points to our risk-based capital ratio by reducing investment concentrations and reinvesting into higher-rated debt securities. As we have repeatedly discussed, our primary focus is to maintain a strong capital position. That is especially true today, given uncertainty in the global economic environment and the volatility of capital markets. As such, we will continue to assess the creditworthiness of issuers in our portfolio and manage our investments in a way that reflects our risk tolerance and the objectives we've set for earnings growth. In that regard, we continue to believe our objectives of increasing operating earnings per diluted share 9% to 12% in 2010 and 8% to 12% in 2011, before the impact of currency translation, are achievable."

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  July 27, 2010  Aflac Incorporated today reported its second quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate and lower realized investment losses, total revenues rose 15.5% to $5.0 billion in the second quarter of 2010, compared with $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2009. Net earnings were $581 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, compared with $314 million, or $.67 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the second quarter of 2010 included after-tax realized investment losses of $58 million, or $.12 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $249 million, or $.53 per share a year ago. Securities transactions produced realized investment gains of $8 million, or $.02 per diluted share, in the second quarter, which included a gain of $81 million from the exchange of two perpetual securities, a loss of $67 million from the company's sale of its Greek sovereign holdings and a loss of $6 million from various smaller securities transactions. In addition, the company realized a loss of $66 million, or $.14 per diluted share, from valuing foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps on certain variable interest entities that were required to be consolidated following adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, effective January 1, 2010. The bonds associated with these swaps were in an unrealized gain position at June 30, 2010, and changes in the fair value of the bonds are reflected in shareholders' equity.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions and the impact from ASC 810; the impact from ASC 815; and nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions and the impact from ASC 810, the impact from ASC 815, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $639 million, compared with $562 million in the second quarter of 2009. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 12.5% to $1.35 in the quarter, compared with $1.20 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.02 during the second quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 10.8%.
Results for the first six months of 2010 also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues were up 10.0% to $10.0 billion, compared with $9.1 billion in the first half of 2009. Net earnings were $1.2 billion, or $2.58 per
diluted share, compared with $882 million, or $1.89 per share, for the first six months of 2009. Operating earnings for the first half of 2010 were $1.3 billion, or $2.76 per diluted share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $2.42 per share, in 2009. Excluding the benefit of $.07 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 11.2% for the first six months of 2010.
Total investments and cash at the end of June 2010 were $79.5 billion, compared with $74.0 billion at March 31, 2010. The increase in total investments and cash resulted from improvement in the fair values of the company's investments since the end of the first quarter and the strengthening of the yen.
Shareholders' equity was $10.0 billion at June 30, 2010, compared with $9.0 billion at March 31, 2010. Shareholders' equity at the end of the second quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $136 million, compared with a net unrealized loss of $214 million at the end of March 2010. Shareholders' equity per share was $21.31 at June 30, 2010, compared with $19.14 per share at March 31, 2010. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the second quarter was 24.5%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact from ASC 815 on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 26.8% for the second quarter.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 3.2% in the second quarter of 2010. Premium income in yen rose 3.8%, and net investment income increased 3.0%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 34% of Aflac Japan's second quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Reflecting the continued improvement in the benefit ratio, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 19.7% to 21.1%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 10.8%. For the first half of the year, premium income in yen increased 3.5%, and net investment income rose 2.7%. Total revenues in yen were up 3.4%, and pretax operating earnings grew 13.7%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the second quarter of 2010 was 92.05, or 6.0% stronger than the average rate of 97.53 in the second quarter of 2009. For the first six months, the average exchange rate was 91.26, or 4.6% stronger than the rate of 95.44 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the second quarter and first six months were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 9.8% to $3.2 billion in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 9.0% to $593 million. Total revenues increased 9.2% to $3.8 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 17.4% to $798 million. For the first six months, premium income was $6.4 billion, or 8.1% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 7.4% to $1.2 billion. Total revenues were up 8.0% to $7.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $1.6 billion, or 19.0% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan again produced better-than-expected sales results. Total new annualized premium sales rose 12.6% to 33.9 billion yen in the second quarter of 2010. In dollar terms, total new annualized premium sales were $368 million. For the first six months of the year, total new annualized premium sales were up 11.4% to 64.1 billion yen, or $702 million. Sales of ordinary life insurance were very strong in the second quarter and primarily reflected the popularity of the child endowment product. Ordinary life sales rose 42.0% in yen and accounted for approximately 38% of total new sales in the second quarter. The strong sales performance in the quarter was also driven by contributions from EVER, Aflac Japan's market-leading medical product. Medical sales rose 23.5% in the second quarter of 2010, compared with a year ago. Bank channels sales continued a strong trend of growth. Bank channel sales were a record 3.9 billion yen in the second quarter, increasing 26.0% over the first quarter of 2010 and 177.7% over the second quarter of 2009.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues rose 5.1% to $1.3 billion in the second quarter. Premium income increased 4.9% to $1.1 billion, and net investment income was up 6.1% to $135 million. Pretax operating earnings were $227 million, an increase of 15.0%. For the first six months, total revenues were up 4.4% to $2.6 billion and premium income rose 4.2% to $2.3 billion. Net investment income increased 5.9% to $267 million. Pretax operating earnings were $471 million, or 17.3% higher than a year ago.
Aflac U.S. sales continued to be impacted by weak economic conditions in the United States. In the second quarter, total new sales declined 2.4% to $333 million. Total new sales included Aflac Group Insurance sales of $10 million in the second quarter of 2010. For the first half of the year, total new sales were $649 million, or 6.3% below a year ago. As expected, recruitment of new sales associates was down in the quarter, compared with a year ago, but fairly consistent with first quarter 2010 recruitment levels.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.28 per share is payable on September 1, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 18, 2010.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's second quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are pleased with Aflac's financial performance in the second quarter of 2010 and believe we have made significant progress toward our annual objectives for operating earnings growth and capital strength. Aflac Japan's operations have remained strong while producing significant sales growth. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our full-year sales target in Aflac Japan, our largest segment. Sales in the United States continue to be challenged by the extended weak economic environment, however we are encouraged by the recent improvement in the productivity of our veteran sales associates. Although we expect third quarter sales to be lower than a year ago, we remain hopeful we will see U.S. sales turn in the second half of the year.
"Despite ongoing volatility in capital markets, we are also pleased with the quality of our balance sheet and our capital position. Along those lines, we took advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio during the second quarter by selling and exchanging certain investments. In addition, total realized investment losses in the second quarter were significantly lower than a year ago. We remain especially pleased with the continued strength of our capital position. Based on preliminary statutory numbers, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio exceeded 560% at the end of June, compared with 539% at the end of the first quarter.
"With half of the year complete, we believe we are in a very good position to meet our earnings objectives and extend our record of growth. Our objective for 2010 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12%, excluding the impact of the yen. Within that range, we expect operating earnings to increase approximately 10% for the full year to $5.34 per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency. If the yen averages 90 to the dollar for the remainder of the year, we would expect full-year reported earnings to be about $5.44 per diluted share. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we expect third quarter operating earnings of $1.35 to $1.38 per diluted share. Our objective for 2011 of increasing operating earnings by 8% to 12% before the impact of foreign currency also remains unchanged."

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a "safe harbor" to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements. We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This document contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by Company officials in communications with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Furthermore, forward-looking information is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements containing words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "goal," "objective," "may," "should," "estimate," "intends," "projects," "will," "assumes," "potential," "target" or similar words as well as specific projections of future results, generally qualify as forward-looking. Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements. We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy; governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets; defaults and downgrades in certain securities in our investment portfolio; impairment of financial institutions; credit and other risks associated with Aflac's investment in perpetual securities; differing judgments applied to investment valuations; subjective determinations of amount of impairments taken on our investments; limited availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments; concentration of our investments in any particular sector; concentration of business in Japan; ongoing changes in our industry; exposure to significant financial and capital markets risk; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; significant changes in investment yield rates; deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions; subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to the Parent Company; changes in law or regulation by governmental authorities; ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates and employees; decreases in our financial strength or debt ratings; ability to continue to develop and implement improvements in information technology systems; changes in U.S. and/or Japanese accounting standards; failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security; level and outcome of litigation; ability to effectively manage key executive succession; catastrophic events; and failure of internal controls or corporate governance policies and procedures.

On August 9, 2010, Aflac Incorporated (the "Company") issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.45% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "2015 Notes") and $450 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.45% Senior Notes due 2040 (the "2040 Notes" and, together with the 2015 Notes, the "Notes") in a public offering pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-159111) (the "Registration Statement"), prospectus dated May 11, 2009, and related prospectus supplement dated August 4, 2010. The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement, dated August 4, 2010, among the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. The Company anticipates using the net proceeds from the sale of these Notes for debt repayment in full at maturity of the Company's $170 million (using the June 30, 2010, exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of 1.52% Uridashi Notes and $226 million (using the June 30, 2010, exchange rate) aggregate principal amount of the variable interest rate Uridashi Notes (0.68% as of June 30, 2010), both due September 2011, repurchasing its common stock and general corporate purposes.
The 2015 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.45% per annum and mature on August 15, 2015 and the 2040 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.45% per annum and mature on August 15, 2040. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 each year, beginning on February 15, 2011. The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date; plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.
The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by a third supplemental indenture with respect to the 2040 Notes, dated as of August 9, 2010 (the "Third Supplemental Indenture") and as supplemented by a fourth supplemental indenture with respect to the 2015 Notes, dated as of August 9, 2010 (the "Fourth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Third Supplemental Indenture and the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including, among other things, nonpayment, failure to comply with the other agreements in the Indenture for a period of 90 days, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization.
The description of the Indenture set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the Base Indenture, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 21, 2009, the Third Supplemental Indenture (including the form of Notes included therein), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 and the Fourth Supplemental Indenture (including the form of Notes included therein), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

provided
however

8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand
 
or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile
 
transmission to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282-2198, Attention: Registration Department; and to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10179, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

however
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.

Section 1.01 . There is hereby established a new series of senior notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's 6.45% Senior Notes due 2040 (the "Senior Notes").
Establishment
There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $450,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of the Original Indenture and the terms of this Third Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in a Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated). Any such additional Senior Notes and the Senior Notes established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.
The Senior Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities (as defined below) in substantially the form set out in Exhibit A hereto.
The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.
Section 1.02 . The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.

"Interest Payment Date" means February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2011.

Section 1.03 . The principal of the Senior Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity. The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes, and any overdue installment of interest thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall bear interest at the rate of 6.45% per year until paid or made available for payment, such interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from August 9, 2010. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on February 15, 2011, to the Person in whose name the Senior Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on a Redemption Date (as defined below) as provided herein, will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Regular Record Date and may be paid as provided in Section 2.7 of the Original Indenture.
Payment of Principal and Interest
Payments of interest on the Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the
 
Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.

The rights of holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the Depositary.
A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.

WHEREAS, the Company proposes to create under the Indenture a new series of senior notes;
WHEREAS, additional senior notes of other series hereafter established, except as may be limited in the Original Indenture as at the time supplemented and modified, may be issued from time to time pursuant to the Indenture as at the time supplemented and modified, and all senior notes issued by the Company of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise so provided, may be reopened for issuances of additional senior notes of such series; and
WHEREAS, all things necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture and make it a valid and binding agreement of the Company, in accordance with its terms, have been done.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.01 . There is hereby established a new series of senior notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's 3.45% Senior Notes due 2015 (the "Senior Notes").
Establishment
There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $300,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of the Original Indenture and the terms of this Fourth Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in a Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated). Any such additional Senior Notes and the Senior Notes established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.
The Senior Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities (as defined below) in substantially the form set out in Exhibit A hereto.
The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.
Section 1.02 . The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.

"Global Security" means, with respect to any series of securities, a security authenticated and delivered under the Original Indenture executed by the Company and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instruction, all in accordance with the Original Indenture, which shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.
 
"Interest Payment Date" means February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on February 15, 2011.

Section 1.03 . The principal of the Senior Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity. The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes, and any overdue installment of interest thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall bear interest at the rate of 3.45% per year until paid or made available for payment, such interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from August 9, 2010. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on February 15, 2011, to the Person in whose name the Senior Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on a Redemption Date (as defined below) as provided herein, will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Regular Record Date and may be paid as provided in Section 2.7 of the Original Indenture.
Payment of Principal and Interest
Payments of interest on the Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the
 
Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.
Section 1.04 . The Senior Notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The rights of holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the Depositary.
A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.

The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.

Morgan Securities Inc. and their successors or, if any of such firms is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.

"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  August 10, 2010  Aflac Incorporated announced today that its board of directors approved a 7.1% increase in the quarterly cash dividend, effective with the fourth quarter payment. The fourth quarter dividend of $.30 per share is payable on December 1, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2010.
The company also announced today its intent to resume share repurchase activities. Since first initiating a share repurchase program in 1994, the company has purchased 232.1 million shares. Aflac suspended its share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2008, following the onset of the financial crisis. At the end of June 2010, the company had 32.4 million shares available for repurchase under authorizations from the board of directors.
Commenting on today's announcements, Aflac Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "I am very pleased with today's action by our board of directors to approve an increase in the cash dividend effective with the fourth quarter payment. This action is consistent with the expectations we have expressed throughout the last several quarters. Extending our lengthy track record of dividend increases is important to Aflac and to those who own a part of this company. This increase will mark the 28
th
consecutive year in which we have raised the dividend.
"I'm also pleased to announce the resumption of Aflac's share repurchase program. As we have frequently conveyed, our primary focus throughout 2009 and into this year has been on building capital. This conservative approach has resulted in Aflac's strong U.S. and Japanese capital adequacy ratios. Our strong capital position, combined with relative stability in global credit markets, gives us confidence to resume repurchasing our shares. Depending on market conditions, we may purchase up to three million shares as early as the fourth quarter of this year. We currently anticipate buying six to 12 million shares in 2011.
"Going forward, we will continue to prudently balance our objectives of maintaining strong capital ratios while growing earnings at a pace we believe our owners will find attractive. For 2010, we remain focused on increasing operating earnings per diluted share by approximately 10% before the effect of foreign currency. Our goal for 2011 of increasing operating earnings by 8% to 12% before the impact of foreign currency remains unchanged."

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  October 26, 2010  Aflac Incorporated today reported its third quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, total revenues rose 19.2% to $5.4 billion during the third quarter of 2010, compared with a year ago. Net earnings were $690 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, compared with $363 million, or $.77 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the third quarter of 2010 included after-tax realized investment gains of $6 million, or $.01 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $226 million, or $.48 per share a year ago. Realized investment gains in the third quarter included several small securities transactions and impairments that produced a net loss of $3 million, or $.01 per diluted share. In addition, the company recognized a gain of $9 million, or $.02 per diluted share, from valuing foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps on certain variable interest entities that were required to be consolidated following adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, effective January 1, 2010. The bonds associated with these swaps were in an unrealized gain position at September 30, 2010, and changes in the fair value of the bonds are reflected in shareholders' equity.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions and the impacts from ASC 810 and ASC 815, as well as nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, the impacts from ASC 810 and ASC 815, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $684 million, compared with $589 million in the third quarter of 2009. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 16.0% to $1.45, compared with $1.25 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.07 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 10.4%.
Results for the first nine months of 2010 also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues rose 13.0% to $15.4 billion, compared with $13.7 billion for the first nine months of 2009. Net earnings were $1.9 billion, or $4.03 per diluted share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $2.66 per share, a year ago. Operating earnings for the first nine months of 2010 were $2.0 billion, or $4.21 per diluted share, compared with $1.7 billion, or $3.67 per share, in 2009. Excluding the benefit of $.14 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 10.9% for the first nine months of 2010.
 
Total investments and cash at September 30, 2010, were $85.6 billion, compared with $79.5 billion at June 30, 2010. The increase in total investments and cash reflected a stronger yen at the end of the period and improvement in the fair values of the company's investments, compared with invested asset values at the end of the second quarter of 2010.
Shareholders' equity was $11.1 billion at September 30, 2010, compared with $10.0 billion at June 30, 2010. Shareholders' equity at September 30, 2010, included a net unrealized gain on investment securities of $592 million, compared with a net unrealized gain of $136 million at June 30, 2010. Shareholders' equity per share was $23.63 at September 30, 2010, compared with $21.31 per share at June 30, 2010. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the third quarter was 26.1%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact from ASC 815 on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 26.8% for the third quarter.
AFLAC JAPAN
In the third quarter, Aflac Japan's premium income in yen rose 3.8%, and net investment income rose .8%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 33% of Aflac Japan's third quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues in yen were up 3.2%. Due to continued improvement in the benefit and expense ratios, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 20.0% to 21.2%. As a result, pretax operating earnings in yen increased 9.5%. For the first nine months, premium income in yen increased 3.6%, and net investment income was up 2.1% over the same period in 2009. Total revenues grew 3.4%, and pretax operating earnings increased 12.3%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2010 was 85.74, or 9.1% stronger than the average rate of 93.56 in the third quarter of 2009. For the first nine months, the average exchange rate was 89.33, or 6.1% stronger than the rate of 94.79 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the third quarter and first nine months of the year were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 13.2% to $3.5 billion in the third quarter. Net investment income was up 9.9% to $624 million. Total revenues increased 12.5% to $4.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings advanced 19.5% to $866 million. For the first nine months of the year, premium income was $9.8 billion, or 9.8% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 8.2% to $1.8 billion. Total revenues were up 9.6% to $11.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $2.5 billion, or 19.1% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales increased 15.5% to 34.6 billion yen, or $403 million in the third quarter. For the first nine months of 2010, total new annualized premium sales were up 12.8% to 98.7 billion yen, or $1.1 billion. The increase in third quarter sales reflected strong results in the ordinary life insurance and medical product categories. Sales of the child endowment product increased significantly, rising 118.8% in the third quarter. Reflecting tougher comparisons, medical sales rose 3.9% in the quarter, compared with a year ago. In addition, sales through the bank channel continued to expand. Bank channel sales in the third quarter were up 170.7%, compared with a year ago, to a record 5.9 billion yen.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 3.6% to $1.1 billion, and net investment income was up 11.9% to $138 million in the third quarter. Total revenues rose 4.4% to $1.3 billion in the third quarter. Pretax operating earnings were $228 million, an increase of 5.8%. For the first nine months of the year, premium income rose 4.0% to $3.4 billion. Net investment income rose 7.8% to $404 million. Total revenues were up 4.4% to $3.9 billion, and pretax operating earnings increased 13.3% to $699 million.
 
Aflac U.S. total new annualized premium sales continued to reflect weak economic conditions in the United States. In the third quarter, total new sales declined 5.3% to $324 million. Total new sales included Aflac Group Insurance sales of $17 million in the third quarter of 2010. For the nine months, total new sales were $973 million, or 5.9% below a year ago. Recruitment of new sales associates was weak in the quarter, compared with a year ago, showing a continuation of the trend from the first half of the year.
DIVIDEND
As announced on August 10, 2010, the board of directors approved an increase in the cash dividend effective with the fourth quarter 2010 payment. The fourth quarter dividend of $.30 per share is payable on December 1, 2010, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 17, 2010. This marks the 28
th
consecutive year in which the dividend has been increased.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's third quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Overall, we remain pleased with Aflac's financial performance in 2010. Our financial results in the third quarter were consistent with our expectations, and keep us on track for achieving our annual objective for operating earnings growth. At the same time, we remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and capital position. Based on preliminary statutory numbers, we estimate our risk-based capital ratio exceeded 580% at the end of September, compared with 560% at the end of June.
"We are especially pleased with Aflac Japan's results for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. We have produced improving top-line growth, while the expansion of the profit margin has continued to enhance Aflac Japan's earnings growth. Aflac Japan's sales growth has also been impressive for the last several quarters. Based on our year-to-date sales results, we expect to exceed our annual objective this year of zero to 5% growth in new sales. We are also pleased with the operations and financial results of Aflac U.S. New sales continued to be restrained by the weak economic environment in the third quarter. We believe Aflac U.S. sales have been particularly impacted by employment conditions and confidence levels among employers and consumers. Although our sales outlook for Aflac U.S. remains cautious in the short term, our longer-term view on the U.S. market has not changed. We believe the need for the products we sell remains very strong, and we are taking measures to better reach potential customers. We continue to believe the U.S. provides a vast and accessible market for our products, and we are building our business with an economic recovery in mind.
"We continue to believe we are strongly positioned to meet our earnings objectives and extend our record of growth. Our objective for 2010 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share by 9% to 12%, excluding the impact of the yen. Within that range, we expect operating earnings to increase approximately 10% for the full year to $5.34 per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency. If the yen averages 80 to 85 to the dollar for the fourth quarter, we would expect full-year reported operating earnings to be approximately $5.52 to $5.57 per diluted share. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we expect fourth quarter operating earnings of $1.31 to $1.36 per diluted share. Our objective of increasing operating earnings by 8% to 12% in 2011 before the impact of foreign currency also remains unchanged. However, if interest rates remain at historically low levels, earnings growth in 2011 would likely be at the low end of the range."

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  February 1, 2011  Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Total revenues, benefiting from the 8.6% strengthening of the yen to the dollar in the fourth quarter, rose 15.2% to $5.3 billion, compared with $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. Net earnings were $437 million, or $.92 per diluted share, compared with $251 million, or $.53 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 included after-tax realized investment losses of $191 million, or $.41 per diluted share, compared with realized investment losses of $307 million, or $.65 per share, a year ago. Securities transactions produced realized investment gains of $27 million, or $.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter. Impairments of Allied Irish Banks, Irish Life and Permanent, and Aiful Corporation, combined with several other small security transactions and impairments, totaled $263 million, or $.56 per diluted share. Subsequent to year-end 2010, Aflac sold its holdings of Allied Irish Banks at the impaired price. In addition, the company realized a gain of $45 million, or $.10 per diluted share, from valuing foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps on certain variable interest entities that were required to be consolidated following adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810, effective January 1, 2010. The bonds associated with these swaps were in an unrealized gain position at December 31, 2010, and changes in the fair value of the bonds are reflected in shareholders' equity.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions and the impacts from ASC 810 and ASC 815, as well as nonrecurring items. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, the impacts from ASC 810 and ASC 815, and nonrecurring items tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $628 million, compared with $558 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 12.7% to $1.33, compared with $1.18 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.06 during the quarter.
In the fourth quarter, Aflac repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock. At the end of December, the company had 30.4 million shares available for purchase under its share repurchase authorization.
Results for the full year also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues rose 13.6% to $20.7 billion, compared with $18.3 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $2.3 billion, or $4.95 per diluted share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $3.19 per share, in 2009. Operating earnings for the full year of 2010 were $2.6 billion, or $5.53 per diluted share, compared with $2.3 billion, or $4.85 per share, in 2009. Excluding the benefit of $.19 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 10.1% for the year.
Total investments and cash at the end of December 2010 were $88.2 billion, compared with $85.6 billion at September 30, 2010. The increase in total investments and cash primarily resulted from a stronger yen at the end of the period.
Shareholders' equity was $11.1 billion at December 31, 2010, unchanged from September 30, 2010. Shareholders' equity at the end of the year included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $64 million, compared with a net unrealized gain on investment securities of $592 million on September 30, 2010. Shareholders' equity per share was $23.54 at the end of the year, compared with $23.63 per share at September 30, 2010. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the fourth quarter was 15.7%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact from ASC 815 on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 23.3% for the fourth quarter of 2010.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 4.4% in the fourth quarter. Net investment income in yen was unchanged, reflecting the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 32.6% of Aflac Japan's fourth quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 3.5%. The pretax operating profit margin declined slightly from 18.7% to 18.6% for the quarter, due primarily to an increase in the benefit ratio for the quarter, compared with a year ago. The benefit ratio increase was due to reserve adjustments made to a closed block of dementia business. Pretax operating earnings in yen rose 2.9% in the fourth quarter. For the year, premium income in yen grew 3.8%, and net investment income was up 1.6%. Total revenues were up 3.4%, and pretax operating earnings increased 10.0%. Excluding the impact of a stronger yen, the benefit ratio for 2010 was 59.5%, compared with 60.4% for 2009.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2010 was 82.58, or 8.6% stronger than the average rate of 89.70 in the fourth quarter of 2009. For the full year of 2010, the average exchange rate was 87.69, or 6.6% stronger than the full-year rate of 93.49 in 2009.
Reflecting a benefit from the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate in the fourth quarter, premium income in dollars increased 13.3% to $3.6 billion. Net investment income rose 8.6% to $643 million. Total revenues were $4.3 billion, an increase of 12.3%. Pretax operating earnings rose 11.8% to $798 million. For the full year, Aflac Japan's results in dollar terms also benefited from the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate. Premium income rose 10.8% to $13.5 billion. Net investment income increased 8.3% to $2.5 billion. Total revenues were up 10.3% to $16.0 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $3.3 billion, an increase of 17.3% over a year ago.
Aflac Japan's total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter increased 6.5% to 37.1 billion yen, or $448 million. For the year, total new sales were up 11.0% to 135.8 billion yen, or $1.6 billion. Bank channel sales rose 140.4% to a record 7.0 billion yen in the fourth quarter, rising 18.4% from the third quarter. At the end of 2010, 364 banks, or more than 90% of the total number of banks in Japan, had agreements to offer Aflac products to their customers. As the bank channel has become a larger contributor to sales, Aflac Japan has enhanced its product portfolio to better meet the needs of banks. This includes WAYS, a whole life policy that can be converted to a fixed annuity, medical coverage or nursing care benefits at a predetermined age; and Aflac's child endowment product, which is primarily used to help fund the higher costs associated with a child entering high school and college. Sales of WAYS increased 149.9% for the quarter and 65.7% for the year, and the child endowment product increased 67.4% for the quarter and 132.0% for the year.
The medical product category was the number one contributor to total sales for both the fourth quarter and full year, at 29.8% and 34.2%, respectively. Although sales in the medical category were solid, they faced record 2009 sales, particularly in the fourth quarter. As anticipated, medical sales, including Rider MAX, were down for the quarter and the year, posting a decline of 29.4% and 3.2%, respectively. Cancer insurance sales also made a solid contribution to total sales results both for the quarter and the year, accounting for 21.4% and 22.0% of total sales, respectively. Cancer insurance sales were up 7.4% for the quarter and down 13.5% for the year. Aflac maintained its position as the number one seller of medical and cancer products in Japan.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 1.0% to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Net investment income increased 16.1% to $144 million. Total revenues rose 2.5% to $1.3 billion. As a result of improvement in the benefit and expense ratios and the strong increase in net investment income, pretax operating earnings increased 42.3% to $225 million in the fourth quarter. For the year, premium income was up 3.2% to $4.6 billion. Net investment income increased 9.9% to $549 million. Total revenues were $5.1 billion, up 3.9% from a year ago. Pretax operating earnings for the year rose 19.2% to $924 million.
The economic climate in the United States continued to pose challenges for U.S. sales growth. Total new annualized premium sales in the fourth quarter declined 2.3% to $409 million. New annualized premium sales for Aflac U.S. included sales from Aflac Group Insurance of $42.6 million in the fourth quarter. This result represents an increase of 58.7% for the quarter and accounted for 51.4% of Aflac Group Insurance production for the year.
For the year, total new sales decreased 4.9% to $1.4 billion, which includes new annualized premium sales of $82.8 million from Aflac Group Insurance. Although recruitment of sales associates in the fourth quarter was down 8.5%, it showed significant improvement over the 25.4% decline in recruiting for the first nine months of the year.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the first quarter cash dividend. The first quarter cash dividend of $.30 per share is payable on March 1, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2011.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's fourth quarter and full-year results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Aflac had a very solid year from a financial perspective, despite ongoing challenges in the economic landscape. Our results were consistent with our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year. Growth of operating earnings per diluted share was in line with our goal of a 9% to 12% increase before the impact of foreign currency.
"Aflac Japan gets high marks for a great fourth quarter and year, following strong sales results in 2009. Our strategy of offering relevant products through an expanding distribution system contributed to sales results that exceeded our targets for two consecutive years. 2010 was the year of the bank channel, having secured buy-in from more than 90% of banks in Japan who've agreed to sell Aflac products. We have also customized our product portfolio to appeal to new market segments by enhancing the benefits of our existing product line. In addition, our Japanese operations continued to improve top-line growth throughout 2010, while the expansion of the profit margin also enhanced Aflac Japan's earnings growth.
"We are also pleased with the operations and financial results of Aflac U.S. As we discussed throughout 2010, sales growth in the United States was primarily held back by the ongoing weak economic environment. We believe Aflac U.S. sales have been impacted by consumer confidence and small business sentiment that continues to hover at low levels. While we remain cautious in our short-term sales outlook for Aflac U.S., our longer-term view has not changed. We believe the need for the products we sell remains very strong and we are taking measures to better reach potential customers through our product and distribution strategy. This includes broadening our product portfolio to include group products in addition to our traditional individually issued products.
"Furthermore, our balance sheet remained strong throughout 2010, and we believe that our investment approach of effectively matching assets to policy liabilities is the most prudent approach for our policyholders and shareholders. More than anything, we have intensely focused on assessing our capital level. Aflac's capital position from a U.S. regulatory standpoint steadily improved throughout 2010. Our goal was to end 2010 with a higher risk-based capital (RBC) ratio than our year-end 2009 RBC ratio of 479%. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate our 2010 RBC ratio exceeded 580%. I believe our ability to maintain a strong RBC exemplifies our effective capital management strategy.
"Our decision as to whether to increase the dividend or repurchase our shares is a function of our capital position. As a result of strong capital levels and solid financial strength, I am pleased 2010 marked the 28
th
consecutive year Aflac has increased cash dividends. Our capital position also gave us the confidence to resume our share repurchase program, and we purchased two million shares in the fourth quarter. We anticipate repurchasing six to 12 million shares in 2011.
"As we look ahead to 2011 sales opportunities in the United States, with the unemployment rate showing little sign of improvement and the confidence of consumers and employers remaining relatively low, we expect sales to be flat to up 5% for Aflac U.S. In Japan, with two consecutive years of strong sales results, we expect sales to be in the range of down 2% to up 3%.
"As I commented in our third quarter release, we will likely be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per share growth in 2011. Although interest rates have increased somewhat in the United States recently, they have not increased as much in Japan, and yen yields remain very low. If we assume 8% earnings per share growth, we would earn $5.97 per diluted share, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 80 to 85 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported earnings to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share."

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  April 27, 2011  Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
Total revenues, reflecting a stronger yen and realized investment losses, rose 1.0% to $5.12 billion, compared with $5.07 billion in the first quarter of 2010. Net earnings were $395 million, or $.84 per diluted share, compared with $636 million, or $1.35 per share, a year ago.
As a result of significant investment derisking activities, net earnings in the first quarter included after-tax realized investment losses of $376 million, or $.79 per diluted share, compared with losses of $30 million, or $.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter, the company sold its holdings of Alpha Bank at a realized after-tax loss of $115 million. In addition, impairments of the company's two other investments in Greek financial institutions, National Bank of Greece and EFG Eurobank Ergasias, totaled $258 million after taxes. Subsequent to the quarter, the company sold its investment in EFG Eurobank Ergasias at a small gain over the impaired value. In addition, the company lowered its holdings of certain concentrated investment positions, which combined with other smaller transactions and impairments, resulted in an after-tax gain of $16 million. Also included in realized investment losses was a loss of $19 million associated with primarily passive derivative activities.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities, which are primarily passive in nature, include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated, and securities with embedded derivatives. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $771 million, compared with $666 million in the first quarter of 2010. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.63, compared with $1.41 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.10 during the quarter.
Total investments and cash at the end of March 2011 were $88.4 billion, compared with $88.2 billion at December 31, 2010.
In the first quarter, Aflac repurchased 3.1 million shares of its common stock. At the end of March, the company had 27.3 million shares available for purchase under its share repurchase authorization.
Shareholders' equity was $11.0 billion at March 31, 2011, compared with $11.1 billion at December 31, 2010. Shareholders' equity at the end of the first quarter included a net unrealized loss on investment securities and derivatives
of $21 million, compared with a net unrealized gain of $64 million at the end of 2010. Shareholders' equity per share was $23.58 at March 31, 2011, compared with $23.54 per share at December 31, 2010. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the first quarter was 14.3%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of derivative gains/losses on net earnings and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 28.0% for the first quarter of 2011.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan premium income in yen rose 4.8% in the first quarter. Net investment income was down slightly with a decline of .7%. Investment income growth in yen terms was restrained by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 33% of Aflac Japan's first quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. Total revenues were up 3.7%. The benefit and expense ratios improved from a year ago, and as a result, the pretax operating profit margin expanded from 21.4% to 22.4%. Pretax operating earnings in yen rose 8.5% in the first quarter.
Aflac Japan's first quarter financial results reflect a provision of 3.0 billion yen, or $37 million, for claims related to the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan on March 11. These claims were offset by reserve releases and reinsurance of 2.0 billion yen, or $25 million, for a net income statement impact of 1.0 billion yen, or $12 million, in the quarter. The financial results also reflect .7 billion yen, or $8 million, of operating expenses resulting from the earthquake and tsunami.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2011 was 82.29, or 10.0% stronger than the average rate of 90.49 in the first quarter of 2010.
Reflecting a benefit from the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter, premium income in dollars rose 15.5% to $3.7 billion. Net investment income climbed 9.5% to $649 million. Total revenues were $4.4 billion, an increase of 14.2%. Pretax operating earnings increased 19.3% to $980 million.
Aflac Japan produced strong new annualized premium sales in the first quarter, generating an increase of 12.6% to 34.1 billion yen. In dollar terms, new annualized premium sales were $414 million. The positive sales performance primarily reflected continued growth of sales through the bank channel. Bank channel sales were 7.9 billion yen in the first quarter, increasing 12.6% over the fourth quarter of 2010 and 154.0% compared with the first quarter of 2010. New annualized premium sales of WAYS increased 221.6% and contributed 17.7% to new annualized premium sales. New annualized premium sales of child endowment increased 58.9% and contributed 21.8% to total sales.
Cancer insurance sales declined as expected and were down 10.4% for the quarter as prospective policyholders and sales agents postponed cancer insurance purchases and sales in anticipation of the introduction of DAYS, the new base cancer policy that was introduced at the end of March. Sales of cancer insurance accounted for 17.5% of new annualized premium sales. Facing difficult comparisons from first quarter 2010, total medical sales, including riders, were also down for the quarter, posting a decline of 20.1%. Despite the decline, medical insurance sales accounted for 27.6% of new annualized premium sales. Aflac maintained its position as the number one seller of cancer and medical products in Japan.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. premium income increased 2.5% to $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Net investment income rose 8.8% to $144 million. Total revenues were up 3.1% to $1.3 billion. As expected, the benefit ratio increased from first quarter 2010, returning to a more normal level. The benefit ratio in 2010 was unusually low due to the lapsation of a large payroll account. Offsetting the increase in the benefit ratio was a lower expense ratio. Overall, the pretax profit margin increased from 19.1% to 19.2% in the quarter, and pretax operating earnings improved 3.7% to $253 million.
Despite lingering sales challenges from a prolonged weak economic climate, Aflac U.S. sales growth improved significantly, generating a new annualized premium sales increase of 6.3% in the first quarter to $336 million. This sales increase reflected an increase in production from both new and veteran agents that resulted from efforts to better manage existing accounts and methodically target the market.
Recruiting continued to improve and turned positive in the first quarter 2011, generating an increase of 13.5%. Recruiting benefited from a targeted national advertising campaign designed to generate a positive response by featuring successful sales associates conveying the Aflac opportunity.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter cash dividend of $.30 per share is payable on June 1, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2011.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are pleased with our overall results in the first quarter of 2011. As we expected, we saw strong sales in our largest operating segment, Aflac Japan, particularly through the bank channel as well as our more recent growth products.
"Additionally, we were especially encouraged that Aflac U.S. generated positive sales growth, despite lingering economic weakness and following nine consecutive quarters of sales declines. Aflac U.S. has also shown significant recruiting gains largely because of successful, targeted activities, including advertising. As a result of our positive performance in both Japan and the U.S., we posted strong consolidated financial results.
"Our business continued to generate significant capital in the first quarter. As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital, or RBC ratio, remains a top priority for us. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the first quarter, we estimate our RBC ratio fell within the range of 500% and 525% at the end of March.
"Realized investment losses were unusually high, primarily resulting from significant investment derisking activities in the first quarter of 2011. However, I am pleased we were able to lower some of our largest credit exposures. While our largest exposures are predominantly a legacy issue, we continue to look at ways to reduce these positions where practical. Although limiting the concentration risk of our portfolio and maintaining our targeted capital levels remains a priority, we are also focused on growing our operating earnings.
"With one quarter of the year complete, we continue to believe we are positioned for another year of solid financial performance. We still believe our goal for increasing operating earnings per diluted share is reasonable and attainable. I believe we've also done a very good job in managing our operations, including expense control. As the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly on marketing and IT initiatives. As we have said previously, given the continued low-interest-rate environment, especially in Japan, we expect to be at the low end of the 8% to 12% range for operating earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 80 to 85 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported operating earnings to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect second quarter operating earnings to be $1.51 to $1.57 per diluted share.
"We historically announce our earnings guidance for the following year at our May analyst meeting. Although we have not yet finalized our projections for 2012, it is likely that our expected rate of earnings growth next year will be lower than 2011 due primarily to portfolio derisking activities and the continued low-interest-rate environment in Japan. After the effects of derisking and low interest rates in Japan and the United States have been fully integrated into our financial results, we should expect to see the rate of increase in earnings begin to improve."

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  July 27, 2011  Aflac Incorporated today reported its second quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate but higher realized investment losses, total revenues rose 2.2% to $5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2011, compared with $5.0 billion in the second quarter of 2010. Net earnings were $280 million, or $.60 per diluted share, compared with $581 million, or $1.23 per share, a year ago.
Consistent with the company's previously stated proactive investment derisking objectives, net earnings in the second quarter included pretax realized investment losses of $668 million ($453 million after-tax), or $.96 per diluted share, compared with pretax losses of $89 million ($58 million after-tax), or $.12 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. During the second quarter of 2011, the company sold investment securities (amortized cost of $1.5 billion; $2.3 billion par value), and realized a pretax loss of $182 million ($118 million after-tax). The most notable sales in the quarter included Banco BPI (amortized cost of $306 million; $310 million par value), resulting in a pretax loss of $99 million ($64 million after-tax); Irish Life and Permanent (amortized cost of $112 million; $457 million par value), resulting in a pretax loss of $74 million ($48 million after-tax); and NBG Finance PLC (amortized cost of $212 million; $372 million par value), resulting in a pretax loss of $47 million ($31 million after-tax). The company also sold EFG Hellas PLC, which was previously impaired at March 31, 2011, (amortized cost of $166 million; $410 million par value), resulting in a pretax gain of $2 million ($1 million after-tax). In addition, the company impaired certain securities, resulting in a pretax loss of $528 million ($343 million after-tax). These impairments included exposures to two Portuguese banks: Banco Espirito Santo S.A., resulting in a pretax loss of $163 million ($106 million after-tax); and Caixa Geral De Depositos, S.A., resulting in a pretax loss of $112 million ($73 million after-tax). In addition, the company recognized a net pretax gain of $42 million ($27 million after-tax) associated with foreign exchange and passive derivative activities.
As a result of the company's proactive investment derisking program, Aflac has significantly reduced peripheral Eurozone, perpetual, and financial exposures on an amortized cost basis. At the start of 2008, sovereign and financial investments in peripheral Eurozone countries made up 5.9% of the total investments and cash, declining to 2.8% by the end of the second quarter of 2011. At the start of 2008, investments in perpetual securities made up 14.7% of total investments and cash, declining to 8.0% by the end of the second quarter of 2011. At the start of 2008, investments in financial securities made up 41.9% of the total portfolio and declined to 30.1% by the end of the second quarter of 2011. As a result of the proactive investment derisking program, the company has no direct investment exposure to Greece, only senior indebtedness in Ireland, and materially lower exposure to Portuguese investments.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities, which are primarily passive in nature, include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated, and securities with embedded derivatives. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also
 
encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $733 million, compared with $639 million in the second quarter of 2010. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 15.6% to $1.56 in the quarter, compared with $1.35 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.11 during the second quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 7.4%.
Results for the first six months of 2011 also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues were up 1.6% to $10.2 billion, compared with $10.0 billion in the first half of 2010. Net earnings were $674 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $2.58 per share, for the first six months of 2010. Operating earnings for the first half of 2011 were $1.5 billion, or $3.19 per diluted share, compared with $1.3 billion, or $2.76 per share, in 2010. Excluding the benefit of $.21 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.0% for the first six months of 2011.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, total investments and cash at the end of June 2011 were $93.0 billion, compared with $88.4 billion at March 31, 2011.
In the second quarter, Aflac repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock, bringing the total number of shares repurchased for the year to 4.1 million. At the end of June, the company had 26.3 million shares available for purchase under its share repurchase authorization.
Shareholders' equity was $12.0 billion at June 30, 2011, compared with $11.0 billion at March 31, 2011. Shareholders' equity at the end of the second quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $758 million, compared with a net unrealized loss of $21 million at the end of March 2011. Shareholders' equity per share was $25.65 at June 30, 2011, compared with $23.58 per share at March 31, 2011. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the second quarter was 9.7%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of derivative gains/losses on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 26.3% for the second quarter.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 3.7% in the second quarter of 2011. Premium income in yen rose 5.1%, and net investment income declined 5.0%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 32% of Aflac Japan's second quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. The pretax operating profit margin remained unchanged from the second quarter of 2010 at 21.1%, and pretax operating earnings in yen increased 3.4%. For the first half of the year, premium income in yen increased 5.0%, and net investment income declined 2.8%. Total revenues in yen were up 3.7%, and pretax operating earnings grew 6.0%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the second quarter of 2011 was 81.54, or 12.9% stronger than the average rate of 92.05 in the second quarter of 2010. For the first six months, the average exchange rate was 81.93, or 11.4% stronger than the rate of 91.26 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the second quarter and first six months were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 18.3% to $3.8 billion in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 7.3% to $636 million. Total revenues increased 16.8% to $4.4 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 16.7% to $931 million. For the first six months, premium income was $7.5 billion, or 16.9% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 8.4% to $1.3 billion. Total revenues were up 15.5% to $8.8 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $1.9 billion, or 18.0% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan again produced better-than-expected sales results. New annualized premium sales rose 6.6% to 36.1 billion yen in the second quarter of 2011. In dollar terms, new annualized premium sales were $442 million. Bank channel sales continued a strong trend of growth, generating 7.6 billion yen in sales in the second quarter, which is an increase of 95.6% over the second quarter of 2010. Sales of WAYS, the unique hybrid whole-life product, increased 190.7% over the second quarter of 2010. As expected, the intense focus on WAYS, which is particularly popular through the bank channel, impacted child endowment sales, which were down 1.4% for the quarter. Following the March 2011 introduction of the new base cancer policy DAYS, cancer sales increased 12.4% over the second quarter of 2010.
For the first six months of the year, new annualized premium sales were up 9.4% to 70.2 billion yen, or $856 million.
 
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues rose 4.0% to $1.3 billion in the second quarter. Premium income increased 3.4% to $1.2 billion, and net investment income was up 9.7% to $148 million. Pretax operating earnings were $246 million, an increase of 8.3%. For the first six months, total revenues were up 3.6% to $2.7 billion and premium income rose 2.9% to $2.4 billion. Net investment income increased 9.2% to $291 million. Pretax operating earnings were $499 million, or 5.9% higher than a year ago.
Aflac U.S. sales showed improvement in the quarter as targeted product and field force recruiting initiatives continued to take hold. In the second quarter, new sales increased 5.9% to $353 million. Benefiting from coordinated field force marketing efforts, dental sales increased 44.1%. For the first half of the year, new sales increased 6.1% to $689 million. Field force recruiting benefited from targeted national advertising campaigns, generating a 10.2% increase in recruits for the second quarter and 11.9% for the six months.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.30 per share is payable on September 1, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2011.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's second quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are pleased with our overall results in the second quarter of 2011. Aflac Japan overcame challenges resulting from the most destructive and devastating natural disaster in Japan's history, to achieve strong sales growth.
"We were also encouraged that Aflac U.S. continued to generate positive sales results, despite the lingering weakness in the U.S. economy. Aflac U.S. has continued to generate significant recruiting gains, which we believe benefited from targeted advertising activities designed to promote the Aflac sales opportunity. As a result of our positive performance in both Japan and the U.S., we posted strong consolidated financial results.
"As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital, or RBC ratio, remains a top priority for us. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the second quarter, we estimate our RBC ratio will be within the range of 480% and 520% at the end of June. The strength of our capital position has allowed us to pursue our proactive investment derisking program to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance shareholder value for the long term. Additionally, we've reviewed, and are comfortable with, Aflac Japan's preliminary solvency margin ratio.
"Like the first quarter, realized investment losses reflected the significant progress we've made with our proactive investment derisking program. I am pleased with where we are with that initiative and believe the extensive sales and impairments of riskier investments are largely behind us. However, we will continue to closely monitor Aflac's consolidated $93 billion portfolio.
"With two quarters of the year complete, we continue to believe we are positioned for another year of solid financial performance. While we believe our proactive investment derisking program has been substantially completed from a realized investment loss perspective, we continue to be challenged by the low interest rate environment, especially in Japan. I believe we've done a very good job in managing our operations, including expense control. However, as the year progresses, we anticipate increasing our spending, particularly on marketing and IT initiatives. I want to reaffirm our 2011 objective of growing operating earnings per diluted share at 8%, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 80 to 85 to the dollar for the full year, we would expect reported operating earnings to be in the range of $6.09 to $6.34 per diluted share. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect third quarter operating earnings of $1.54 to $1.60 per diluted share.
"Looking ahead, we expect 2012 operating earnings per diluted share to increase 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis. This upward revision to our 2012 earnings objective assumes no additional significant investment losses and no further meaningful decline in interest rates. Furthermore, once the effects of our investment derisking and low interest rates have been fully integrated into our financial results, we believe the rate of earnings growth in future years should improve."

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
EXHIBIT 99.1
COLUMBUS, Georgia  October 26, 2011  Aflac Incorporated today reported its third quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, revenues rose 11.0% to $6.0 billion in the third quarter of 2011, compared with $5.4 billion in the third quarter of 2010. Net earnings were $744 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, compared with $690 million, or $1.46 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the third quarter of 2011 included pretax realized investment losses of $83 million ($34 million after-tax, or $.07 per diluted share), compared with pretax gains of $9 million ($6 million after-tax, or $.01 per diluted share), a year ago. Several securities transactions, including the sale of the two remaining holdings of the company's investments in Portuguese financial institutions, Banco Espirito Santo S.A. and Caixa Geral De Depositos S.A., a portion of its U.S. Treasury holdings, and various Japanese National Government bonds (JGBs) that were part of a swap program, produced a pretax gain of $307 million ($200 million after-tax, or $.43 per diluted share). In addition, the company impaired certain debt and perpetual securities including Dexia, BAWAG Capital Finance Jersey, and Hypo Vorarlberg Capital Finance, resulting in a pretax loss of $166 million ($108 million after-tax, or $.23 per diluted share). Realized investment losses also included a pretax loss of $224 million ($145 million after-tax, or $.31 per diluted share) associated with foreign exchange and passive derivative activities.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities, which are primarily passive in nature, include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated, and securities with embedded derivatives. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $778 million, compared with $684 million in the third quarter of 2010. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 14.5% to $1.66 in the quarter, compared with $1.45 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.09 during the third quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 8.3%.
Results for the first nine months of 2011 also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues were up 4.9% to $16.2 billion, compared with $15.4 billion in the first nine months of 2010. Net earnings were $1.4 billion, or $3.02 per diluted share, compared with $1.9 billion, or $4.03 per share, for the first nine months of 2010. Operating earnings for the first nine months of 2011 were $2.3 billion, or $4.86 per diluted share, compared with $2.0 billion, or $4.21 per diluted share, in
 
2010. Excluding the benefit of $.31 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.1% for the first nine months of 2011.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, total investments and cash at the end of September 2011 were $100.8 billion, compared with $93.0 billion at June 30, 2011.
In the third quarter, Aflac repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock, bringing the total number of shares repurchased for the year to 5.1 million. At the end of September, the company had 25.3 million shares available for purchase under its share repurchase authorization.
Shareholders' equity was $12.7 billion at September 30, 2011, compared with $12.0 billion at June 30, 2011. Shareholders' equity at the end of the third quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $708 million, compared with a net unrealized gain of $758 million at the end of June 2011. Shareholders' equity per share was $27.25 at September 30, 2011, compared with $25.65 per share at June 30, 2011. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the third quarter was 24.1%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of derivative gains/losses on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 26.8% for the third quarter.
On January 1, 2012, the company will adopt Accounting Standards Update 2010-26 (previously referred to as EITF 09-G), an accounting standard that amends accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts (deferred acquisition costs, or DAC). These amended accounting rules are intended to address the diversity in practice regarding which costs qualify as deferred acquisition costs. Based on the December 31, 2010 exchange rate, the retrospective adoption of this accounting standard will result in an estimated after-tax cumulative charge to the company's retained earnings of $500 million to $700 million, or 4.5% to 6.3% of shareholder's equity as of December 31, 2010. The company currently estimates the adoption of this accounting standard will result in an immaterial decrease in net income in 2011 and 2012 and for all preceding years impacted by the retrospective adoption. This accounting standard is not applicable to the company's statutory reporting, nor will it impact the company's risk-based capital or holding company liquidity position.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 4.8% in the third quarter of 2011. Premium income in yen rose 5.4%, and net investment income increased .9%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 34% of Aflac Japan's third quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. The pretax operating profit margin remained relatively unchanged from the third quarter of 2010 at 21.7%, and pretax operating earnings in yen increased 7.5%. For the first nine months of the year, premium income in yen increased 5.1%, and net investment income declined 1.6%. Total revenues in yen were up 4.1%, and pretax operating earnings grew 6.5%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2011 was 77.78, or 10.2% stronger than the average rate of 85.74 in the third quarter of 2010. For the first nine months, the average exchange rate was 80.48, or 11.0% stronger than the rate of 89.33 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the third quarter and first nine months were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 16.3% to $4.0 billion in the third quarter. Net investment income was up 11.3% to $695 million. Total revenues increased 15.5% to $4.7 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 18.5% to $1.0 billion. For the first nine months, premium income was $11.5 billion, or 16.7% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 9.4% to $2.0 billion. Total revenues were up 15.5% to $13.5 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $2.9 billion, or 18.2% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan again produced better-than-expected sales results. New annualized premium sales rose 22.2% to 42.3 billion yen in the third quarter of 2011. In dollar terms, new annualized premium sales were $544 million. Bank channel sales were again very strong, generating 14.5 billion yen in sales in the third quarter, which is an increase of 146.6% over the third quarter of 2010. Sales of WAYS, the unique hybrid whole-life product, increased 362.8% over the third quarter of 2010. As expected, the intense focus on WAYS, which is particularly popular through the bank channel, impacted child endowment sales, which were down 8.0% for the quarter. Following the March 2011 introduction of the new base cancer policy DAYS, cancer sales increased 8.5% over the third quarter of 2010.
For the first nine months of the year, new annualized premium sales were up 13.9% to 112.5 billion yen, or $1.4 billion.
 
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues rose 4.0% to $1.3 billion in the third quarter. Premium income increased 3.7% to $1.2 billion, and net investment income was up 7.1% to $147 million. Pretax operating earnings were $220 million, a decrease of 3.8%. For the first nine months, total revenues were up 3.7% to $4.0 billion and premium income rose 3.2% to $3.5 billion. Net investment income increased 8.5% to $439 million. Pretax operating earnings were $719 million, or 2.7% higher than a year ago.
Aflac U.S. sales performed well for the third consecutive quarter as targeted product and field force recruiting initiatives continued to take hold. In the third quarter, new sales increased 5.0% to $340 million. Field force recruiting benefited from targeted national advertising campaigns, generating a 10.4% increase in recruits for the third quarter and 11.4% for the nine months. For the nine months, total new sales increased 5.7% to $1.0 billion.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the fourth quarter cash dividend. The fourth quarter dividend of $.33 per share is payable on December 1, 2011, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 16, 2011. This represents a 10.0% increase in the quarterly cash dividend effective with the fourth quarter payment.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's third quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "We are pleased with our overall results in the third quarter of 2011. Aflac Japan sales greatly exceeded our expectations, largely because of our ability to develop relevant products such as WAYS that appeal to banks and Japanese consumers alike. We are proud of Aflac Japan's remarkable results, especially following two years of exceptional sales growth and the challenges in 2011 resulting from the most devastating natural disaster in Japan's history. Our outstanding sales results in 2011 will create difficult comparisons in 2012.
"We were also pleased that Aflac U.S. continued to generate strong sales results, despite the continued weakness in the U.S. economy. Strategic coordination between our sales and marketing areas, which are more closely aligned than ever, continues to benefit our sales results. On the product side, sales have benefited significantly from the addition of group products to our Aflac U.S. product portfolio and strategic, coordinated sales and marketing efforts. On the distribution side, Aflac U.S. has continued to generate significant recruiting gains, which we believe benefited from targeted advertising activities that promote the Aflac sales opportunity. As a result of our positive performance in both Japan and the U.S., we posted strong consolidated financial results.
"As we have communicated over the past several years, maintaining a strong risk-based capital, or RBC ratio, remains a top priority for us. Although we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the third quarter, we estimate our RBC ratio will be within the range of 500% and 540% at the end of September. Our strong capital position has enabled us to increase our cash dividend for the 29
th
consecutive year. I am very pleased with the action by the board of directors to increase the quarterly dividend by 10.0%, effective with the fourth quarter of 2011. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate that's in line with or somewhat better than earnings-per-share growth.
"With three quarters of the year complete, we continue to believe we are positioned for another year of solid financial performance. Throughout the year, both Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have continued to do a very good job managing our operations, including expense control. As we have stated previously, our expectation was to increase spending in the last half of the year, particularly on marketing and IT initiatives in the fourth quarter. Despite our expectation for higher spending in the fourth quarter, I am confident we will achieve our 2011 objective of growing operating earnings per diluted share at 8%, excluding the impact of the yen. If the yen averages 75 to 80 to the dollar for the last three months of the year, we would expect reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.52 per diluted share. Under that exchange rate assumption, we would expect full year operating earnings of $6.30 to $6.37 per diluted share.
"Looking ahead, I want to reiterate our expectation that 2012 operating earnings per diluted share will increase 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis. Furthermore, once the effects of our proactive investment derisking program and low interest rates have been integrated into our financial results, we believe the rate of earnings growth in future years should improve."

Aflac Incorporated Form 8-K
Exhibit 99.1
 
COLUMBUS, Georgia  January 31, 2012  Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, revenues rose 12.9% to $6.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net earnings were $546 million, or $1.17 per diluted share, compared with $437 million, or $.92 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 included after-tax realized investment losses, net of realized investment gains, of $145 million, or $.31 per diluted share, compared with net after-tax losses of $191 million, or $.41 per diluted share, a year ago. After-tax realized investment losses in the quarter were $522 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, and primarily resulted from the impairment of several securities. The impairment charges reflect enhancements to the company's investment strategy to improve diversification and credit profile by reducing our exposure to Europe through opportunistic investment transactions. After-tax realized investment gains from securities transactions in the quarter were $355 million, or $.76 per diluted share. The realized investment gains were primarily generated by the sale of the company's remaining holdings of U.S. Treasury strips and various Japanese Government bonds (JGBs) that were part of a swap program. The company also realized an after-tax gain of $22 million, or $.05 per diluted share, associated with foreign exchange and passive derivative activities.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities, which are primarily passive in nature, include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $691 million, compared with $628 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 11.3% to $1.48 in the quarter, compared with $1.33 a year ago. The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.06 during the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 6.8%.
Results for the full year also benefited from the stronger yen. Total revenues were up 6.9% to $22.2 billion, compared with $20.7 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $2.0 billion, or $4.18 per diluted share, compared with $2.3 billion, or $4.95 per share, in 2010. Operating earnings for the full year were $3.0 billion, or $6.33 per diluted share, compared with $2.6 billion, or $5.53 per diluted share, in 2010. Excluding the benefit of $.36 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 8.0% for the year.
 
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, total investments and cash at the end of December 2011 were $103.5 billion, compared with $100.8 billion at September 30, 2011.
In the fourth quarter, Aflac repurchased ..9 million shares of its common stock, bringing the total number of shares repurchased for the year to 6.0 million. At the end of December, the company had 24.4 million shares available for purchase under its share repurchase authorization.
Shareholders' equity was $13.5 billion at December 31, 2011, compared with $12.7 billion at September 30, 2011. Shareholders' equity at the end of the fourth quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $1.2 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain of $708 million at the end of September 2011. Shareholders' equity per share was $28.96 at December 31, 2011, compared with $27.25 per share at September 30, 2011. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the fourth quarter was 16.6%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of derivative gains/losses on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 22.7% for the fourth quarter.
On January 1, 2012, the company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2010-26 (previously referred to as EITF 09-G), an accounting standard that amends accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts (deferred acquisition costs, or DAC). These amended accounting rules are intended to address the diversity in practice regarding which costs qualify as deferred acquisition costs. The retrospective adoption of this accounting standard will result in an estimated after-tax cumulative charge to the company's retained earnings of $400 million to $500 million, or 3.6% to 4.5% of shareholder's equity as of December 31, 2010. The company currently estimates the adoption of this accounting standard will result in an immaterial impact in net income in 2011 and 2012 and for all preceding years impacted by the retrospective adoption. This accounting standard is not applicable to the company's statutory reporting, nor will it impact the company's risk-based capital or holding company liquidity position.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 6.0% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Premium income in yen rose 6.3%, and net investment income increased 3.2%. Investment income growth in yen terms was suppressed by the stronger yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 33% of Aflac Japan's fourth quarter investment income was dollar-denominated. The pretax operating profit margin increased from the fourth quarter of 2010, rising from 18.6% to 19.0%, and pretax operating earnings in yen increased 8.0%. For the year, premium income in yen increased 5.4%, and net investment income declined .4%. Total revenues in yen were up 4.5%, and pretax operating earnings grew 6.8%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 was 77.35, or 6.8% stronger than the average rate of 82.58 in the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year of 2011, the average exchange rate was 79.73, or 10.0% stronger than the rate of 87.69 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for both the fourth quarter and the full year were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.

operating earnings were $198 million, a decrease of 11.8% for the quarter. For the year, total revenues were up 3.8% to $5.3 billion and premium income rose 3.4% to $4.7 billion. Net investment income increased 7.1% to $588 million. Pretax operating earnings were $917 million, a slight decrease of .8% from a year ago.
Aflac U.S. sales performed well for the fourth consecutive quarter. New sales increased 9.3% to $447 million, benefiting from strong performance generated by both the core traditional and broker sales channels. For the full year, total new sales increased 6.8% to $1.5 billion, which exceeded the Aflac U.S. sales objective for the year.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the first quarter cash dividend. The first quarter dividend of $.33 per share is payable on March 1, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2012.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's fourth quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: "Aflac had another strong year. Growth of operating earnings per diluted share was in line with our goal of an 8% increase before the impact of foreign currency. That result was also consistent with guidance we provided when we released third quarter results. We had conveyed in the third quarter that following nine months of restrained expenditures, we planned to increase spending on IT and marketing initiatives in the fourth quarter to strengthen our business, and that's exactly what we did. I am pleased that 2011 marked the 22
nd
consecutive year in which we achieved our earnings objective.
"Aflac Japan gets high marks for another great quarter and year. The tremendous sales momentum they generated this quarter, largely propelled by success in selling through banks, significantly exceeded our expectations for the year and especially for the quarter. In fact, Aflac Japan's fourth quarter production set an all-time quarterly record, which is especially remarkable considering 2011 was the year Japan was hit with the most devastating natural disaster in its history.
"We are also pleased with Aflac U.S. results for the quarter and year. It has been, and continues to be, the longstanding goal and vision of Aflac U.S. to be the leading provider of voluntary insurance in the United States, and our sales results in 2011 build on that vision. Through our efforts, we continue to expand Aflac's potential to connect with employees at more companies, large and small, across the United States. The 2009 addition of group products to our existing portfolio has allowed us to leverage our strong brand and provide more options for customers of both our traditional and broker distribution channels. In 2011, product marketing efforts geared toward existing accounts contributed to strong sales for our veteran agents. Additionally, you'll recall that we have been establishing and developing relationships with brokers that handle the larger-case market. While this broker initiative is still in its infancy, we are excited about the opportunity this channel presents for future growth.
"The strength of our capital ratios demonstrates our commitment to maintain financial strength on behalf of our policyholders and bondholders. As we have communicated over the past several years, sustaining a strong risk-based capital, or RBC ratio, remains a priority for us. We had conveyed that our goal was to end 2011 with an RBC ratio in the range of 400% to 500% with a target of 450%. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate our 2011 RBC ratio will be between 480% and 520%. Additionally, we are comfortable with our solvency margin ratio and continue to apply rigorous stress testing under extreme scenarios.
"As we look ahead to 2012 sales opportunities in the United States, we expect Aflac U.S. sales to increase 3% to 8%. Following Aflac Japan's outstanding sales growth of 18.6% last year, I think it's reasonable to expect Aflac Japan sales will decrease within the range of down 2% to down 5% for the year.
"Looking ahead, I want to reiterate that our objective for 2012 is to increase operating earnings per diluted share 2% to 5% on a currency neutral basis. This range reflects the impact of portfolio derisking and investing significant cash flows at low interest rates. We expect the rate of earnings growth in 2013 to improve over 2012."

No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as
 
the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company
 
agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
 
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives jointly.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10179, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk; and to Goldman, Sachs & Co. at 200 West Street, New York, NY 10282-2198, Attention: Registration Department; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.
provided
however
In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company
 
agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters' imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

THIS FIFTH SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this "Fifth Supplemental Indenture") is made as of the 10th day of February, 2012, by and between AFLAC INCORPORATED, a Georgia corporation, as issuer (the "Company"), and THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON TRUST COMPANY, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"):
WHEREAS, the Company has heretofore entered into a Senior Indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Original Indenture"), with the Trustee;
WHEREAS, the Original Indenture is incorporated herein by reference, and the Original Indenture, as supplemented by this Fifth Supplemental Indenture, is herein called the "Indenture";
WHEREAS, under the Original Indenture, a new series of senior notes may at any time be established by the Board of Directors of the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Original Indenture and the terms of such series may be described by a supplemental indenture executed by the Company and the Trustee;
WHEREAS, the Company proposes to create under the Indenture a new series of senior notes;
WHEREAS, additional senior notes of other series hereafter established, except as may be limited in the Original Indenture as at the time supplemented and modified, may be issued from time to time pursuant to the Indenture as at the time supplemented and modified, and all senior notes issued by the Company of any one series need not be issued at the same time and, unless otherwise so provided, may be reopened for issuances of additional senior notes of such series; and
WHEREAS, all things necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture and make it a valid and binding agreement of the Company, in accordance with its terms, have been done.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.01 . There is hereby established a new series of senior notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's 2.65% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Senior Notes").
Establishment
There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $400,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of the Original Indenture and the terms of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the Company may re-open this series of Senior Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in a Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated). Any such additional Senior Notes and the Senior Notes established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.
The Senior Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities (as defined below) in substantially the form set out in Exhibit A hereto.
The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.
Each Senior Note shall be dated the date of authentication thereof and shall bear interest from the date of original issuance thereof or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for.
Section 1.02 . The following defined terms used herein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meanings specified below. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Original Indenture.
Definitions
"Global Security" means, with respect to any series of securities, a security authenticated and delivered under the Original Indenture executed by the Company and delivered by the Trustee to the Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary's instruction, all in accordance with the Original Indenture, which shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee.
 
"Interest Payment Date" means February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2012.
"Regular Record Date" means, with respect to each Interest Payment Date, the close of business on February 1 or August 1 immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.
"Stated Maturity" means February 15, 2017.
Section 1.03 . The principal of the Senior Notes shall be due at Stated Maturity. The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes, and any overdue installment of interest thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall bear interest at the rate of 2.65% per year until paid or made available for payment, such interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from February 10, 2012. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on August 15, 2012, to the Person in whose name the Senior Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on a Redemption Date (as defined below) as provided herein, will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. Any such interest that is not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be payable to the holders on such Regular Record Date and may be paid as provided in Section 2.7 of the Original Indenture.
Payment of Principal and Interest
Payments of interest on the Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of
 
America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.
Section 1.04 . The Senior Notes will be issued only in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Denominations
Section 1.05 . The Senior Notes will initially be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities registered in the name of the Depositary (which initially shall be The Depository Trust Company) or its nominee. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Senior Notes represented by Global Securities will not be exchangeable for, and will not otherwise be issuable as, Senior Notes in definitive form. The Global Securities described above may not be transferred except by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or its nominee.

The rights of holders of such Global Securities shall be exercised only through the Depositary.
A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.
Section 1.06 . No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Senior Notes, but payment will be required of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection therewith.
Transfer
Section 1.07 . The provisions of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 of the Original Indenture will apply to the Senior Notes.
Defeasance
Section 1.08 . The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed, not
Redemption at the Option of the Company
 
including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 30 basis points, plus, in the case of each of (i) and (ii), accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their successors, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
Section 1.09 . The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price.
Notice to Trustee
Section 1.10 . If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate, the principal amount of such Senior Notes held by each beneficial owner of such Senior Notes to be redeemed. The Trustee may select Senior Notes and portions of Senior Notes in amounts of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Senior Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Senior Notes selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
Selection of Senior Notes to be Redeemed; Notice of Redemption
Section 2.01 . The recitals in this Fifth Supplemental Indenture are made by the Company only and not by the Trustee, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture or of the Senior Notes. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company of the Senior Notes or the proceeds thereof. All of the provisions contained in the Original Indenture in respect of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and duties of the Trustee shall be applicable in respect of the Senior Notes and of this Fifth Supplemental Indenture as fully and with like effect as if set forth herein in full.
Recitals by the Company
 
Section 2.02 . As supplemented hereby, the Original Indenture is in all respects ratified and confirmed, and the Original Indenture and this Fifth Supplemental Indenture shall be read, taken and construed as one and the same instrument.
Ratification and Incorporation of Original Indenture

Executed in Counterparts

This is one of the 2.65% Senior Notes due 2017 referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This note (the "Note") represents one of a duly authorized issue of senior notes of the Company issued and issuable in one or more series under a Senior Indenture dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 10, 2012 (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Original Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures incidental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes (as defined below) issued thereunder and of the terms upon which said Senior Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Securities represented by this Note are one of the series designated on the face hereof as 2.65% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Senior Notes"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $400,000,000; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, as provided in the Fifth Supplemental Indenture. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
This Note is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form only as provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Senior Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Note and (ii) restrictive covenants and the related Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note.
 
The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 30 basis points, plus, in the case of each of (i) and (ii), accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their successors, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but no more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Senior Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall determine, in such manner as it deems appropriate, the principal amount of such Senior Notes held by each beneficial owner of such Senior Notes to be redeemed. The Trustee may select Senior Notes and portions of Senior Notes in amounts of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Senior Notes, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Senior Note on behalf of the Company ("Paying Agent") and the Security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule, law statute or constitutional provision, or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the state of New York.

WHEREAS, the Original Indenture is incorporated herein by reference, and the Original Indenture, as supplemented by this Sixth Supplemental Indenture, is herein called the "Indenture";

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the agreements and obligations set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.01 . There is hereby established a new series of senior notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's 4.00% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "Senior Notes").
Establishment
There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $350,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of the Original Indenture and the terms of this Sixth Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the Company may re-open this series of Senior Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in a Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated). Any such additional Senior Notes and the Senior Notes established pursuant hereto shall be considered collectively as a single class for all purposes of the Indenture. The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.
The Senior Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities (as defined below) in substantially the form set out in Exhibit A hereto.
The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.

Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.

Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
This Note is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form only as provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Senior Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Note and (ii) restrictive covenants and the related Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note.
 
The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 35 basis points, plus, in the case of each of (i) and (ii), accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their successors, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but no more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Senior Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall determine, in such manner as it deems appropriate, the principal amount of such Senior Notes held by each beneficial owner of such Senior Notes to be redeemed. The Trustee may select Senior Notes and portions of Senior Notes in amounts of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Senior Notes, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Senior Note on behalf of the Company ("Paying Agent") and the Security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule, law statute or constitutional provision, or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the state of New York.

EXHIBIT 99.1
AFLAC INCORPORATED ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS,
RAISES AFLAC JAPAN SALES OUTLOOK,
DECLARES SECOND QUARTER CASH DIVIDEND
COLUMBUS, Georgia - April 24, 2012 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, revenues rose 21.9% to $6.2 billion in the first quarter of 2012, compared with $5.1 billion in the first quarter of 2011. Net earnings were $785 million, or $1.68 per diluted share, compared with $389 million, or $.83 per share, a year ago.
Throughout this document, certain prior period numbers have been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of revised accounting guidance for accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts (deferred acquisition costs, or DAC).
Net earnings in the first quarter of 2012 included after-tax realized investment losses, net of realized investment gains, of $29 million, or $.06 per diluted share, compared with net after-tax losses of $376 million, or $.79 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2011. After-tax net realized investment gains from sales and redemptions of securities in the quarter were $51 million, or $.11 per diluted share. These gains primarily resulted from both the redemption of a previously impaired perpetual security and liquidations related to our derisking program where sales prices were slightly better than the prices they had been impaired to on December 31, 2011. After-tax net realized investment losses from impairments in the quarter were $132 million, or $.28 per diluted share. These losses primarily resulted from impairments taken on two Tier 1 securities that were sold subsequent to the end of the quarter. After-tax net realized investment gains from derivatives in the quarter were $52 million, or $.11 per diluted share.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated and foreign currency swaps associated with the company's senior notes. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses
from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $814 million, compared with $765 million in the first quarter of 2011. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 7.4% to $1.74 in the quarter, compared with $1.62 a year ago. Operating earnings benefited by $23 million, or $.05 per share, from the increase in investment income brought about by a one-time receipt of a previously
written off deferred coupon negotiated as part of our derisking activities in the first quarter.
 
The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.04 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 4.9%.
Shareholders' equity was $13.6 billion at March 31, 2012, compared with $12.9 billion at December 31, 2011. Shareholders' equity at the end of the first quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $1.4 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain of $1.2 billion at the end of December 2011. Shareholders' equity per share was $29.19 at March 31, 2012, compared with $27.76 per share at December 31, 2011. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the first quarter was 23.6%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of derivative gains/losses on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 27.1% for the first quarter.
On January 1, 2012, the company adopted revised accounting guidance for accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts (deferred acquisition costs, or DAC). These amended accounting rules are intended to address the diversity in practice regarding which costs qualify as DAC. The retrospective adoption of this accounting standard resulted in an after-tax cumulative charge to the company's retained earnings of $408 million, or 3.9% of adjusted shareholders' equity, as of December 31, 2010, and had an immaterial impact on net income in 2011 and for all preceding years.  This accounting standard is not applicable to the company's statutory reporting, nor will it impact the company's risk-based capital or holding company liquidity position
.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 7.8% in the first quarter of 2012. Premium income in yen rose 7.8%, and net investment income increased 8.7%. Investment income growth benefited from the receipt of a deferred coupon as previously discussed. The pretax operating profit margin decreased from the first quarter of 2011, declining from 22.3% to 21.3%, reflecting a higher benefit ratio partially offset by a lower expense ratio. Pretax operating earnings in yen increased 3.2%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2012 was 79.59, or 3.4% stronger than the average rate of 82.32 in the first quarter of 2011. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for the quarter were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 12.0% to $4.1 billion in the first quarter. Net investment income was up 12.5% to $730 million. Total revenues increased 12.0% to $4.9 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 6.8% to $1.0 billion.
Aflac Japan again produced significant sales growth in the quarter. New annualized premium sales rose 53.8% to a record 52.4 billion in the first quarter of 2012. In dollar terms, new annualized premium sales were $659 million. Bank channel sales were again very strong, generating 24.3 billion in sales in the first quarter, an increase of 208.9% over the first quarter of 2011. Sales of WAYS, Aflac's unique hybrid whole-life product, increased 283.4% over the first quarter of 2011. Cancer sales in the first quarter were up 14.2%, reflecting continued positive results from the new cancer DAYS product rolled out a year ago. At the end of January, the company introduced an upgraded medical policy, and initial consumer response has been positive.
 
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues rose 5.2% to $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Premium income increased 5.2% to $1.2 billion, and net investment income was up 5.5% to $152 million. The pretax operating profit margin expanded from 19.1% a year ago to 19.6%, primarily benefiting from a lower expense ratio. Pretax operating earnings were $271 million, an increase of 8.1% for the quarter.
Aflac U.S. total new annualized premium sales increased 4.5% to $351 million. First quarter sales benefited from strong performance by the broker channel. During the quarter, Aflac made inroads in developing relationships with larger national brokers that sell to the larger-case employer market. Additionally, persistency in the quarter improved to 74.7% from 73.0% a year ago.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.33 per share is payable on June 1, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 16, 2012.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: We are pleased with our overall results in the first quarter of 2012. Aflac Japan gets high marks for another great quarter. The tremendous sales momentum they again generated this quarter was largely propelled by success in selling through banks. Aflac Japan's first quarter production set an all-time new annualized premium sales record for the third quarter in a row.
More importantly, we believe the first quarter has positioned us for another strong year of sales activities in Japan. As a result, we now expect Aflac Japan's full year sales to increase 10%, compared with our previous expectation of a sales decline.
We are also pleased with Aflac U.S. results for the quarter. Despite challenges that remain in the U.S. economy, we continue to focus on expanding our reach to employees at companies, large and small. You'll recall that we have been establishing and developing relationships with brokers that handle the larger-case market. While this broker initiative is still in the early stages, we are excited about the opportunity this channel presents for future growth.
With respect to our investment portfolio, we are extremely pleased with our progress in reducing our exposure to subordinated debt and perpetual securities of European financial issuers. When discussing our fourth quarter 2011 results, we stated our objective was to improve our diversification and credit profile by further reducing our exposure to European investments. We have made significant progress executing that plan. From the beginning of December 2011, we liquidated more than 130 billion out of the 150 billion of book value target we set, which includes several disposals that took place subsequent to the end of the quarter. While we still view Europe as an area of investment risk, I believe our portfolio is better-positioned to accommodate market volatility in the future.
Additionally, I am encouraged by the initial results from our strategic business review of Aflac's global investment capabilities. This review is certainly a first step on the path to achieving our goal of being a world-class investment organization. The success of our derisking activities included the receipt of a deferred coupon that allows us to accelerate the funding of this critical global initiative, while still achieving our operating earnings-per-share objective this year. I believe the enhancements we're making to our investment team, processes and infrastructure will position us to invest our sizeable cash flows at more attractive returns through a more diversified and high-quality portfolio.
The level of our regulatory capital ratios demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of our policyholders and bondholders. We are very pleased with the significant increase in our risk-based capital, or RBC ratio.
As we have communicated over the past several years, sustaining a strong RBC ratio remains a priority for us. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements for the first quarter, we estimate our quarterly RBC ratio will be between 500% and 540%. We also expect that Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio, or SMR, improved significantly over year-end 2011.
Overall, I'm looking forward to another good year for Aflac, and I'm excited for our growth opportunities that lie ahead. With one quarter of the year complete, we continue to believe we are positioned for another year of solid financial performance. Although we expect the new accounting for DAC to impact earnings per share by approximately $.05, we still expect to produce operating earnings of $6.46 to $6.65 per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation. This range represents an increase of 3% to 6% over 2011 as restated for the change in DAC accounting compared with our prior 2012 objective of 2% to 5% growth. We believe our earnings-per-share objective for 2012 is reasonable and attainable, and we continue to look for better earnings growth in 2013.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On June 28, 2012, Aflac Incorporated (the Company), and American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus (the Insurance Subsidiary and together with the Company, the Borrowers) entered into a 364-day senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement (the Credit Agreement) in the amount of 50 billion with a syndicate of financial institutions, including Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. as administrative agent and lead arranger, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation as syndication agent, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. as documentation agent, and certain other financial institutions as lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for borrowings in Japanese yen or the equivalent of Japanese yen in U.S. dollars on a revolving basis. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including a capital contingency plan for the Japanese operations of the Borrowers. The Company will guarantee the payment and performance of all obligations of the Insurance Subsidiary under the Credit Agreement.
The Credit Agreement requires a specified minimum consolidated net worth and statutory surplus, and specifies a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Borrowers to incur certain types of liens, enter into certain mergers or consolidations, and use proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement for other than permitted uses. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.
The Credit Agreement will expire on the earlier of (a) June 27, 2013, or (b) the date of termination of the commitments upon an event of default. An event of default, as defined in the Credit Agreement, includes but is not limited to failure to pay amounts owed thereunder when due, a breach of a covenant, material inaccuracy of a representation, or the occurrence of insolvency proceedings, if not otherwise waived or cured.
Provided that no event of default has occurred and is continuing and all representations and warranties are true and correct in all material respects on the commitment termination date then in effect, the Borrowers may request that commitments under the Credit Agreement be extended for an additional 364-day period from the commitment termination date in effect by providing notice no earlier than 60 days but no later than 45 days prior to the commitment termination date then in effect. The commitment termination date shall not be extended unless the Majority Lenders agree to extend their commitments. (The Majority Lenders are those lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate commitments under the Credit Agreement, or if such commitments have expired or been terminated, those lenders holding more than 50% of the outstanding revolving loans under the Credit Agreement.) No lender shall be obligated to extend its commitment.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.
The information set forth under Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference into this item 2.03.

AFLAC INCORPORATED ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS,
RAISES AFLAC JAPAN SALES OUTLOOK,
AFFIRMS 2012 AND 2013 OPERATING EPS TARGETS,
DECLARES THIRD QUARTER CASH DIVIDEND
COLUMBUS, Georgia - July 24, 2012 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its second quarter results.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, total revenues rose 16.0% to $5.9 billion in the second quarter of 2012, compared with $5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2011. Net earnings were $483 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with $274 million, or $.58 per share, a year ago.
Throughout this document, certain prior period numbers have been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of revised accounting guidance for accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts (deferred acquisition costs, or DAC).
Net earnings in the second quarter of 2012 included after-tax realized investment losses, net of realized investment gains, of $272 million, or $.58 per diluted share, compared with after-tax net losses of $453 million, or $.96 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2011. After-tax net realized investment losses from sales and redemptions of securities in the quarter were $5 million, or $.01 per diluted share. After-tax realized investment losses from impairments in the quarter were $223 million, or $.48 per diluted share. These losses primarily resulted from impairments taken on securities issued by Bankia and Generalitat de Catalunya. Additionally, the company further impaired several securities that had previously been impaired in the fourth quarter 2011. After-tax net realized investment losses from derivatives in the quarter were $44 million, or $.09 per diluted share.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities include foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated and foreign currency swaps associated with the company's senior notes. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses
from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $755 million, compared with $727 million in the second quarter of 2011. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 3.9% to $1.61 in the quarter, compared with $1.55 a year ago.
The stronger yen/dollar exchange rate increased operating earnings per diluted share by $.01 during the quarter. Excluding the impact from the stronger yen, operating earnings per share increased 3.2%.
Results for the first six months of 2012 also benefited from a stronger yen. Total revenues were up 19.0% to $12.1 billion, compared with $10.2 billion in the first half of 2011. Net earnings were $1.3 billion, or $2.71 per diluted share, compared with $663 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2011. Operating earnings for the first half of 2012 were $1.6 billion, or $3.35 per diluted share, compared with $1.5 billion, or $3.17 per diluted share, in 2011. Excluding the benefit of $.06 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 3.8% for the first six months of 2012.
Reflecting the benefit from a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate, total investments and cash at the end of June 2012 were $109.3 billion, compared with $103.1 billion at March 31, 2012.
Shareholders' equity was $14.2 billion at June 30, 2012, compared with $13.6 billion at March 31, 2012. Shareholders' equity at the end of the second quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $1.5 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain of $1.4 billion at the end of March 2012. Shareholders' equity per share was $30.37 at June 30, 2012, compared with $29.19 per share at March 31, 2012. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the second quarter was 13.9%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of derivative gains/losses on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 24.0% for the second quarter.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 9.2% in the second quarter of 2012. Premium income in yen rose 9.7%, benefiting from strong sales of WAYS, Aflac Japan's unique hybrid whole-life product. Net investment income increased 6.9%. The pretax operating profit margin decreased from the second quarter of 2011, declining from 20.9% to 19.6%, reflecting a higher benefit ratio partially offset by a lower expense ratio. Pretax operating earnings in yen increased 2.4%. For the first half of the year, premium income in yen increased 8.8%, and net investment income rose 7.8%. Total revenues in yen were up 8.5%, and pretax operating earnings grew 2.8%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the second quarter of 2012 was 80.19, or 1.7% stronger than the average rate of 81.57 in the second quarter of 2011. For the first six months, the average exchange rate was 79.88, or 2.6% stronger than the rate of 81.95 a year ago. Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for the second quarter and first six months were magnified as a result of the stronger average yen/dollar exchange rates.
Reflecting the stronger yen, premium income in dollars rose 11.8% to $4.2 billion in the second quarter. Net investment income was up 8.6% to $691 million. Total revenues increased 11.2% to $4.9 billion. Pretax operating earnings rose 4.2% to $964 million. For the first six months, premium income was $8.4 billion, or 11.9% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 10.6% to $1.4 billion. Total revenues were up 11.6% to $9.8 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $2.0 billion, or 5.5% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan again produced significant sales growth in the quarter. New annualized premium sales rose 47.4% to a record 53.2 billion in the second quarter of 2012. In dollar terms, new annualized premium sales were $664 million. Bank channel sales were again very strong, generating 24.7 billion in sales in the second quarter, an increase of 224.2% over the second quarter of 2011. Sales of WAYS increased 258.7% over the second quarter of 2011.
For the first six months of the year, new annualized premium sales were up 50.5% to 105.6 billion, or $1.3 billion.
 
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues rose 5.2% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter. Premium income increased 5.5% to $1.3 billion, and net investment income was up 3.6% to $153 million. The pretax operating profit margin expanded from 18.1% a year ago to 18.3%, primarily benefiting from a lower expense ratio. Pretax operating earnings were $258 million, an increase of 6.3% for the quarter. For the first six months, total revenues were up 5.2% to $2.8 billion and premium income rose 5.3% to $2.5 billion. Net investment income increased 4.5% to $304 million. Pretax operating earnings were $529 million, 7.2% higher than a year ago.
    
Aflac U.S. total new annualized premium sales increased 1.5% to $359 million. Persistency in the quarter improved to 76.6% from 75.2% a year ago. For the first half of the year, total new sales rose 3.0% to $709 million.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the third quarter cash dividend. The third quarter dividend of $.33 per share is payable on September 4, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 15, 2012.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's second quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: We are pleased with our overall results in the second quarter of 2012. Aflac Japan had another strong quarter, continuing impressive sales momentum, especially through the bank channel. Aflac Japan's second quarter production set an all-time new annualized premium sales record for the fourth quarter in a row.
I would also note that persistency remained strong. Facing difficult sales comparisons in the third and fourth quarter, we anticipate new annualized premium sales in the second half of the year will be flat to up 5%. However, combining this second half sales expectation with the tremendous results we produced in the first half of the year, we believe it is reasonable to expect an annual sales increase for 2012 of 22% to 25%.
Aflac U.S. also generated positive second quarter results. While sales in the second quarter were slightly below our annual sales target, year-to-date results were in line with our annual sales target of a 3% to 8% increase. With the majority of our enrollments occurring in the fourth quarter, we expect sales results to improve. We're pleased that our distribution channels continue to benefit from our ability to offer both group and individual products. We remain focused on expanding our reach to employees at companies, large and small, and we have positioned our business for growth in the evolving health care environment. Additionally, we believe initiatives to improve servicing levels with current policyholders and payroll accounts have been successful. As such, these efforts have contributed to improved persistency with these customers.
We continued to make progress with the transformation of our Global Investment Division. As we've said many times, we expected to see volatility in Europe, and that's exactly what we saw in the second quarter. Although our total realized losses in the second quarter were higher than the first quarter this year, they were significantly improved compared with the second quarter of 2011. While we still view Europe as an area of potential investment risk, I believe our portfolio is now better-positioned to accommodate market volatility. In the third quarter, we will begin investing in dollar-denominated, public fixed-income securities and currency hedges to yen. We believe this strategy will provide greater liquidity and overall flexibility for our portfolio and increase opportunities to diversify the investment of our significant cash flows beyond JGBs, with the objective of producing higher returns.
 
We had another strong quarter with respect to our capital position. The strength of our capital ratios demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of our policyholders and bondholders, as well as our shareholders.
As we have communicated over the past several years, a strong risk-based capital ratio remains a priority for us. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate our RBC ratio was between 560% and 600% at the end of June, which is up from our year-end ratio of 493%. The significant increase in the ratio from year end is due to the first quarter 2012 implementation of a new statutory accounting standard for income taxes. As you know, our capital adequacy in Japan is principally measured by our solvency margin ratio. We expect that Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio at the end of the second quarter remained at the high end of our 500% to 600% target.
Overall, I look forward to another good year for Aflac, and I'm excited for the growth opportunities that lie ahead. With half of the year complete, we continue to believe we are well-positioned for another year of solid financial performance. I believe we've done a very good job in managing our operations, including expense control. As we've conveyed, focusing on investments is our top priority, and we are investing in initiatives to further our vision of building a world-class investment function. This initiative requires additional layers of complexity and resources with expenditures on IT, personnel, and processes. This is possible, in part, due to the first quarter receipt of a deferred coupon that allows us to accelerate the funding of this critical global initiative, while still achieving our operating earnings-per-share objective this year.
I want to reaffirm that in 2012, we expect operating earnings per diluted share to increase in the range of 3% to 6%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. If the yen averages 80 for the full year it's likely operating earnings per diluted share will be $6.45 to $6.52 for the year, which is toward the lower end of the range, due to the continued low level of investment yields. Using that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect third quarter operating earnings to be $1.64 to $1.69 per diluted share. We believe that is reasonable and achievable. As I conveyed at our analyst meeting in May, for 2013, our target is to achieve growth in operating earnings per diluted share of 4% to 7%, excluding currency.
This earnings objective assumes no significant impact on investment income from losses and no further meaningful decline in interest rates.

On July 27, 2012, Aflac Incorporated (the "Company") issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.65% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Notes"). The Notes were offered by the Company in a public offering pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-181089) (the "Registration Statement"), prospectus dated May 1, 2012, and related prospectus supplement dated July 27, 2012. The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement, dated July 27, 2012, between the Company and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representative of the several underwriters included on Schedule 1 thereto. The Company anticipates using the net proceeds from the sale of these Notes for general corporate purposes, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, if needed.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.65% per annum and mature on February 15, 2017. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 each year, beginning on August 15, 2012. The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date; plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness. The Notes will constitute a single series of senior notes with the outstanding 2.65% Senior Notes due 2017 issued on February 10, 2012 in an aggregate principal amount of $400 million.

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representative expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.
 
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representative.
 
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, 1585 Broadway, New York, New York 10036 (fax: +1 212 507 8999); Attention: Investment Banking Division; and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10179, Attention: High Grade Syndicate Desk; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the Registration Statement, Attention: Secretary; , , that any notice to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by you upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.
15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
 
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
18.
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
21. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company is authorized to disclose to any persons the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment and tax structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Company relating to that treatment and structure, without the Underwriters' imposing any limitation of any kind. However, any information relating to the tax treatment and tax structure shall remain confidential (and the foregoing sentence shall not apply) to the extent necessary to enable any person to comply with securities laws. For this purpose, "tax structure" is limited to any facts that may be relevant to that treatment.
 
If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and return to us six counterparts hereof, and upon the acceptance hereof by you, on behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf of each of the Underwriters is pursuant to the authority set forth in a form of Agreement among Underwriters, the form of which shall be submitted to the Company for examination upon request, but without warranty on your part as to the authority of the signers thereof.

This is one of the 2.65% Senior Notes due 2017 referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.
 
 
This note (the "Note") represents one of a duly authorized issue of senior notes of the Company issued and issuable in one or more series under a Senior Indenture dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Original Indenture"), as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 10, 2012 (the "Fifth Supplemental Indenture") and as further supplemented by the Seventh Supplemental Indenture, dated as of July 31, 2012 (the "Seventh Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Original Indenture and the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures incidental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes (as defined below) issued thereunder and of the terms upon which said Senior Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Senior Note is one of the series designated on the face hereof as 2.65% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "Senior Notes"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 pursuant to the Fifth Supplemental Indenture and increased to an aggregate principal amount of $650,000,000 pursuant to the Seventh Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be further increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, as provided in the Seventh Supplemental Indenture. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
This Note is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form only as provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Senior Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Note and (ii) restrictive covenants and the related Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note.
The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 30 basis points, plus, in the case of each of (i) and (ii), accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no
 
maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their successors, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors and three other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or Goldman, Sachs & Co. or their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but no more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Senior Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall determine, in such manner as it deems appropriate, the principal amount of such Senior Notes held by each beneficial owner of such Senior Notes to be redeemed. The Trustee may select Senior Notes and portions of Senior Notes in amounts of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
 
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Senior Notes, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Senior Note on behalf of the Company ("Paying Agent") and the Security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule, law statute or constitutional provision, or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the state of New York.

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the
provided
however
 
Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
 
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
 
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone such Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
(c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Company shall not exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Underwriters to purchase Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters, then this Agreement shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company and the Underwriters as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.
 
11. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company, or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.
12. If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 10 hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through you for all out of pocket expenses approved in writing by you, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities, but the Company shall then be under no further liability to any Underwriter except as provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof.
13. In all dealings hereunder, you shall act on behalf of each of the Underwriters, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by the Representatives.
All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or facsimile transmission to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC at 1585 Broadway, New York, New York 10036 (fax: +1 212 507 8999), Attention: Investment Banking Division; J.P.

L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Underwriters are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Underwriters to properly identify their respective clients.
 
14. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent provided in Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement.

15. Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in Washington, D.C. is open for business.
16. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm's-length commercial transaction between the Company, on the one hand, and the several Underwriters, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading to such transaction each Underwriter is acting solely as a principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, (iii) no Underwriter has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company with respect to the offering contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Underwriter has advised or is currently advising the Company on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Company has consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. The Company agrees that it will not claim that the Underwriters, or any of them, has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Company, in connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.
17. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company and the Underwriters, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
19. The Company and each of the Underwriters hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
20. This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
21.

The Company may also redeem the Debentures, in whole but not in part, at any time prior to September 26, 2017, within 90 days of the occurrence of certain rating agency events, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) the aggregate principal amount or (b) a make-whole amount, in each case, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On or after September 26, 2017, the Company may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption; provided that if the debentures are not redeemed in whole, at least $25 million aggregate principal amount of the debentures must remain outstanding after giving effect to such redemption.

Registration, Transfer and Exchange
 
(2) Upon due presentation for registration of transfer of any Registered Security of any series at any such office or agency to be maintained for the purpose as provided in Section 3.2, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Registered Security or Registered Securities of the same series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date in authorized denominations for a like aggregate principal amount.
Unregistered Securities (except for any temporary Unregistered Securities in global form) and Coupons (except for Coupons attached to any temporary Unregistered Securities in global form) shall be transferable by delivery.
(3) (a) At the option of the Holder thereof, Registered Securities of any series (other than a Registered Security in global form, except as set forth below) may be exchanged for a Registered Security or Registered Securities of such series having authorized denominations and an equal aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of such Registered Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.2 and upon payment, if the Issuer shall so require, of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
      (b) Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3, at the option of the Holder, Unregistered Securities of such series may be exchanged for Registered Securities (if the Securities of such series are issuable in registered form) or Unregistered Securities (if Unregistered Securities of such series are issuable in more than one denomination and such exchanges are permitted by such series) of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at the agency of the Issuer that shall be maintained for such purpose in accordance with Section 3.2, with all unmatured Coupons and all matured Coupons in default thereto appertaining. If the Holder of an Unregistered Security is unable to produce any such unmatured Coupon or Coupons or matured Coupon or Coupons in default, such exchange may be effected if the Unregistered Securities are accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Issuer and the Trustee in an amount equal to the face amount of such missing Coupon or Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Issuer and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to any paying agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which such a payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such payment as provided in Section 3.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case any Unregistered Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in exchange for a Registered Security of the same series after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any record date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant interest payment date, or (ii) any special record date for payment of defaulted interest and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the related date for payment of defaulted interest, such Unregistered Security shall be surrendered without the Coupon relating to such interest or defaulted interest payment date or proposed date of payment, as the case may be (or, if such Coupon is so surrendered with such Unregistered Security, such Coupon shall be returned to the person so surrendering the Unregistered Security), and interest or defaulted interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Unregistered Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such Coupon, when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
      (c) Registered Securities of any series may not be exchanged for Unregistered Securities of such series unless (i) otherwise specified pursuant to Section 2.3 and (ii) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel that (A) the Issuer has received from the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date hereof, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that the inclusion of terms permitting Registered Securities to be exchanged for Unregistered Securities would result in no adverse Federal income tax effect to the Issuer or to any Holder. Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. All Securities and Coupons surrendered upon any exchange or transfer provided for in this Indenture shall
 
be canceled promptly and disposed of by the Trustee in accordance with its procedures for the disposition of cancelled securities in effect as of the date of such cancellation.
(4) All Registered Securities presented for registration of transfer, exchange, redemption or payment shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by the Holder or his or her attorney duly authorized in writing.
The Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities. No service charge shall be made for any such transaction.
The Issuer shall not be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Securities of any series for a period of 15 days next preceding the first mailing of notice of redemption of Securities of such series to be redeemed or (b) any Securities selected, called or being called for redemption, in whole or in part, except, in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion thereof not so to be redeemed.
(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.8, unless and until it is exchanged in whole or in part for Securities in definitive registered form, a Registered Security in global form representing all or a portion of the Securities of a series may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary for such series to a nominee of such Depositary or by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such Depositary or by such Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary for such series or a nominee of such successor Depositary.
If at any time the Depositary for any Registered Securities of a series represented by one or more Registered Securities in global form notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Registered Securities or if at any time the Depositary for such Registered Securities shall no longer be eligible under Section 2.4, the Issuer shall appoint a successor Depositary eligible under Section 2.4 with respect to such Registered Securities. If a successor Depositary eligible under Section 2.4 for such Registered Securities is not appointed by the Issuer within 90 days after the Issuer receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, the Issuer's election pursuant to Section 2.3 that such Registered Securities be represented by one or more Registered Securities in global form shall no longer be effective and the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form without Coupons, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registered Security or Securities in global form representing such Registered Securities in exchange for such Registered Security or Securities in global form.
The Issuer may at any time and in its sole discretion determine that the Registered Securities of any series issued in the form of one or more Registered Securities in global form shall no longer be represented by a Registered Security or Securities in global form. In such event the Issuer will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer's Certificate for the authentication and delivery of definitive Securities of such series, will authenticate and deliver, Securities of such series in definitive registered form without Coupons, in any authorized denominations, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Registered Security or Securities in global form representing such Registered Securities, in exchange for such Registered Security or Securities in global form.
If specified by the Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3 with respect to Securities represented by a Registered Security in global form, the Depositary for such Registered Security in global form may surrender such Registered Security in global form in exchange in whole or in part for Registered Securities of the same series in definitive form on such terms as are acceptable to the Issuer and such Depositary. Thereupon, the Issuer shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, without service charge,
 
(a) to the Person specified by such Depositary a new Registered Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations as requested by such Person, in an aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for such Person's beneficial interest in the Registered Security in global form; and
(b) to such Depositary a new Registered Security in global form in a denomination equal to the difference, if any, between the principal amount of the surrendered Registered Security in global form and the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities authenticated and delivered pursuant to clause (a) above.
Upon the exchange of a Registered Security in global form for Registered Securities in definitive form without Coupons, in authorized denominations, such Registered Security in global form shall be canceled by the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer or the Trustee. Registered Securities in definitive form issued in exchange for a Registered Security in global form pursuant to this Section 2.8 shall be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary for such Registered Security in global form, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee or an agent of the Issuer or the Trustee. The Trustee or such agent shall deliver such Securities to or as directed by the Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.
(6) All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange of Securities shall be valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.
(7) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the terms of any series of Securities to the contrary, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee (any of which, other than the Issuer, shall conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, on an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel) shall be required to exchange any Unregistered Security for a Registered Security if such exchange would result in adverse income tax consequences to the Issuer.
(8) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Depositary Participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
Section 2.9 . In case any Security or any Coupon appertaining to any Security shall become mutilated, defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer in its discretion may execute, and upon the written request of any officer of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a new Security of the same series, maturity date, interest rate and original issue date, bearing a number or other distinguishing symbol not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated or defaced Security, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen with Coupons corresponding to the Coupons appertaining to the Securities so mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen, or in exchange or substitution for the Security to which such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Coupon appertained, with Coupons appertaining thereto corresponding to the Coupons so mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substitute Security or Coupon shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to indemnify and defend and to save each of them harmless and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof and in the case of mutilation or defacement shall surrender the Security and related Coupons to the Trustee or such agent.
Mutilated, Defaced, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
 
Upon the issuance of any substitute Security or Coupon, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) or its agent connected therewith. In case any Security or Coupon which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or defaced or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Issuer may instead of issuing a substitute Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same or the relevant Coupon (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated or defaced Security or Coupon), if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the Issuer and to the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee such security or indemnity as any of them may require to save each of them harmless, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Issuer and the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Security or Coupon and of the ownership thereof.
Every substitute Security or Coupon of any series issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section by virtue of the fact that any such Security or Coupon is destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security or Coupon shall be at any time enforceable by anyone and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to all the limitations of rights set forth in) this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities or Coupons of such series duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Securities and Coupons shall be held and owned upon the express condition that, to the extent permitted by law, the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, defaced or destroyed, lost or stolen Securities and Coupons and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable instruments or other securities without their surrender.
Section 2.10 . All Securities and Coupons surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer or exchange, or for credit against any payment in respect of a sinking or analogous fund, if surrendered to the Issuer or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee or any agent of the Trustee, shall be delivered to the Trustee or its agent for cancellation or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be canceled by it; and no Securities or Coupons shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The Trustee or its agent shall dispose of canceled Securities and Coupons held by it in accordance with its procedures for the disposition of cancelled securities in effect as of the date of such cancellation. If the Issuer or its agent shall acquire any of the Securities or Coupons, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities or Coupons unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee or its agent for cancellation.
Cancellation of Securities; Destruction Thereof
Section 2.11 . Pending the preparation of definitive Securities for any series, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver temporary Securities for such series (printed, lithographed, typewritten or otherwise reproduced, in each case in form satisfactory to the Trustee). Temporary Securities of any series shall be issuable as Registered Securities without Coupons, or as Unregistered Securities with or without Coupons attached thereto, of any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Securities of such series but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Issuer with the concurrence of the Trustee as evidenced by the execution and authentication thereof. Temporary Securities may contain such references to any provisions of this Indenture as may be appropriate. Every temporary Security shall be executed by the Issuer and be authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities. Without unreasonable delay the Issuer shall execute and shall furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon temporary Registered Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor without charge at each office or agency to be maintained by the Issuer for that purpose pursuant to Section 3.2 and, in the case of Unregistered Securities, at any agency maintained by the Issuer for such purpose as specified pursuant to Section 3.2, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities of such series an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series having authorized denominations and, in the case of Unregistered Securities, having attached thereto any appropriate Coupons. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall be entitled to the
Temporary Securities
 
same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series, unless otherwise established pursuant to Section 2.3. The provisions of this Section are subject to any restrictions or limitations on the issue and delivery of temporary Unregistered Securities of any series that may be established pursuant to Section 2.3 (including any provision that Unregistered Securities of such series initially be issued in the form of a single Unregistered Security in global form to be delivered to a Depositary or agency located outside the United States and the procedures pursuant to which Unregistered Securities in definitive or global form of such series would be issued in exchange for such temporary Unregistered Security in global form).
Section 2.12 . Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
Global Securities
Section 2.13 . The Issuer in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and, if so used by the Issuer, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in any notice of a redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the "CUSIP" numbers.
CUSIP Numbers
provided
Section 3.1 . The Issuer covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on, each of the Securities of such series (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) at the place or places, at the respective times and in the manner provided in such Securities and in the Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto and in this Indenture. The interest on Securities with Coupons attached (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Securities) shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the several Coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they severally mature. If any temporary Unregistered Security provides that interest thereon may be paid while such Security is in temporary form, the interest on any such temporary Unregistered Security (together with any additional amounts payable pursuant to the terms of such Security) shall be paid, as to the installments of interest evidenced by Coupons attached thereto, if any, only upon presentation and surrender thereof, and, as to the other installments of interest, if any, only upon presentation of such Securities for notation thereon of the payment of such interest, in each case subject to any restrictions that may be established pursuant to Section 2.3.
Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest
Section 3.2 So long as any Securities are issued as Registered Securities, the Issuer will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where the Registered Securities of each series may be presented for payment, where the Securities of each series may be presented for exchange as is provided in this Indenture and, if applicable, pursuant to Section 2.3 and where the Registered Securities of each series may be presented for registration of transfer as in this Indenture provided.
Offices for Payments, Etc.
So long as any Securities are issued as Unregistered Securities, the Issuer will maintain one or more offices or agencies in a city or cities located outside the United States (including any city in which such an agency is required to be maintained under the rules of any shares exchange on which the Securities of such series are listed) where the Unregistered Securities, if any, of each series and Coupons, if any,
 
appertaining thereto may be presented for payment. No payment on any Unregistered Security or Coupon will be made upon presentation of such Unregistered Security or Coupon at an agency of the Issuer within the United States nor will any payment be made by transfer to an account in, or by mail to an address in, the United States unless pursuant to applicable United States laws and regulations then in effect such payment can be made without adverse tax consequences to the Issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments in Dollars of Unregistered Securities of any series and Coupons appertaining thereto which are payable in Dollars may be made at an agency of the Issuer maintained in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, if such payment in Dollars at each agency maintained by the Issuer outside the United States for payment on such Unregistered Securities is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange controls or other similar restrictions.
The Issuer will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Securities of any series, the Coupons appertaining thereto or this Indenture may be served.
The Issuer will give to the Trustee written notice of the location of each such office or agency and of any change of location thereof. In case the Issuer shall fail to maintain any agency required by this Section, or shall fail to give such notice of the location or of any change in the location of any of the above agencies, presentations and demands may be made and notices may be served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.
The Issuer may from time to time designate one or more additional offices or agencies where the Securities of a series and any Coupons appertaining thereto may be presented for payment, where the Securities of that series may be presented for exchange as provided in this Indenture and pursuant to Section 2.3 and where the Registered Securities of that series may be presented for registration of transfer as in this Indenture provided, and the Issuer may from time to time rescind any such designation, as the Issuer may deem desirable or expedient; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Issuer of its obligation to maintain the agencies provided for in this Section. The Issuer will give to the Trustee prompt written notice of any such designation or rescission thereof.
Section 3.3 . If the Issuer shall at any time act as its own paying agent, it will, on or before each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Money for Security Payments to be Held in Trust; Unclaimed Money
Whenever the Issuer shall have one or more paying agents, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any Securities, deposit with the paying agent or paying agents a sum sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, or interest so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled to such principal, premium, if any, or interest, and, unless such paying agent is the Trustee, the Issuer will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Issuer will cause each paying agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such paying agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that such paying agent will:
(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on Securities in trust for the benefit of the Holders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;
(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Issuer (or any other obligor upon the Securities) in the making of any payment of principal and premium, if any, or interest; and
 
(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent.
The Issuer may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Order direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Issuer or such paying agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Issuer or such paying agent; and, upon such payment by any paying agent to the Trustee, such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.
Any money deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent, or then held by the Issuer in trust for the payment of the principal of and premium, if any, or interest on any Security and remaining unclaimed for two years after such principal and premium, if any, or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Issuer on Order, or, if then held by the Issuer, shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such paying agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuer as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such paying agent, before being required to make any such repayment, shall at the expense of the Issuer cause to be published at least once, in an Authorized Newspaper in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or, in the case of Unregistered Securities, at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in London, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuer.
Section 3.4 . (1) The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer ending after the date hereof, a certificate, signed by the principal executive officer, principal financial officer or principal accounting officer, stating whether or not to the best knowledge of the signer thereof the Issuer is in default (without regard to periods of grace or requirements of notice) in the performance and observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions hereof, and if the Issuer shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which they may have knowledge.
Statements of Officers of Issuer as to Default; Notice of Default
(2) The Issuer shall file with the Trustee written notice of the occurrence of any default or Event of Default within five Business Days of its becoming aware of any such default or Event of Default and set forth, in an Officer's Certificate, the details of such Event of Default or default and the action which the Issuer proposes to take with respect thereto.
Section 3.5 . Subject to Article IX, the Issuer will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises and those of each of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if its Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Issuer or the business of any Subsidiary and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
Existence
Section 3.6 . The Issuer will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Issuer may be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the Issuer from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any such properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Issuer, desirable in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
Maintenance of Properties
Section 3.7 . The Issuer shall pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges (including withholding taxes and any penalties, interest and additions to taxes) levied or imposed upon the Issuer or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or property of the Issuer or any
Payment of Taxes and Other Claims
 
Subsidiary, and (2) all material lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property of the Issuer or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which disputed amounts adequate reserves have been made.
Section 3.8 . Upon request of the Trustee, or as otherwise necessary, the Issuer will execute and deliver such further instruments and perform such further acts as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Indenture.
Further Instruments and Acts
Section 3.9 . As long as any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the Voting Shares of any Restricted Subsidiary, unless:
Limitations on Dispositions of Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries
(1) the issuance, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition is required to comply with the order of a court or regulatory authority of competent jurisdiction, other than an order issued at the request of the Issuer or of one of its Restricted Subsidiary;
(2) all of the Voting Shares of a Restricted Subsidiary then owned by the Issuer or by its Restricted Subsidiary is disposed of in a single transaction or in a series of related transactions, for a consideration consisting of cash or other property the fair market value of which is at least equal to the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) of such Voting Shares;
(3) the issuance, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition is made to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary; or
(4) after giving effect to the issuance sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiary would own directly or indirectly at least 80% of the issued and outstanding Voting Shares of such Restricted Subsidiary and such issuance, sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition is made for a consideration consisting of cash or other property which is at least equal to the fair market value of such Voting Shares (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may merge or consolidate any of its other Subsidiaries into or with another Person and it may sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of its business in accordance with the provisions of Article IX. Furthermore, the foregoing covenant will not prohibit any issuance or disposition of securities by any other Subsidiary.
Section 3.10 . The Issuer shall file with the Trustee, within 30 days after it files such annual and quarterly reports, information, documents and other reports with the Commission, copies of its annual report and of the information, documents and other reports (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the Commission may by rules and regulations prescribe) which the Issuer is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officer's Certificates). The Trustee shall be under no obligation to analyze or make any credit decisions with respect to reports or other information received by it pursuant to this section, but shall hold such reports and other information solely for the benefit of, and review by, the security holders.
Commission Reports
 
Section 3.11 . The Issuer shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue discount (including daily rates and accrual periods), if any, accrued on Outstanding Securities as of the end of such year and (ii) such other specific information relating to such original issue discount as may then be relevant under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time.
Calculation of Original Issue Discount
Section 4.1 . If and so long as the Trustee shall not be the Security registrar for the Securities of any series, the Issuer and any other obligor on the Securities will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee a list in such form as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the Holders of the Registered Securities of such series pursuant to Section 312 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (1) semi-annually not more than 5 days after each record date for the payment of interest on such Registered Securities, as hereinabove specified, as of such record date and on dates to be determined pursuant to Section 2.3 for non-interest bearing Registered Securities in each year, and (2) at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within thirty days after receipt by the Issuer of any such request as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time such information is furnished.
Issuer to Furnish Trustee Information as to Names and Addresses of Securityholders
Section 4.2 . (1) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Holders contained in the most recent list furnished to the Trustee as provided in Section 4.1 and the names and addresses of Holders received by the Trustee in its capacity as Security Registrar or paying agent. The Trustee may destroy any list furnished to it as provided in Section 4.1 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.
Preservation of Information; Communications to Holders

(1) default in the payment of all or any part of the principal of, or premium, if any, on any of the Securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable either at maturity, upon any redemption, by declaration or otherwise; provided, however, that if the Issuer is permitted by the terms of the Securities of the applicable series to defer the payment in question, the date on which such payment is due and payable shall be the date on which the Issuer is required to make payment following such deferral, if such deferral has been elected pursuant to the terms of the Securities of that series (subject to any deferral of any due date in the case of an extension period); or
(2) default in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Securities of such series as and when the same shall become due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of 30 days and the interest payment date has not been properly extended or deferred; provided, however, that if the Issuer is permitted by the terms of the Securities of the applicable series to defer the payment in question, the date on which such payment is due and payable shall be the date on which the Issuer is required to make payment following such deferral, if such deferral has been elected pursuant to the terms of the Securities of that series (subject to any deferral of any due date in the case of an extension period); or

(5) a decree or order by a court having jurisdiction in the premises shall have been entered adjudging the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary as bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition seeking reorganization of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, and such decree or order shall have continued undischarged and unstayed for a period of 120 days; or a decree or order of a court having jurisdiction in the premises for the appointment of a receiver or liquidator or trustee or assignee in bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or of its or their property, or for the winding up or liquidation of its or their affairs, shall have been entered, and such decree or order shall have remained in force and unstayed for a period of 120 days; or
(6) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, or consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case under any such law, or consent to the appointment or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or similar official) of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or for any substantial part of its or their property, or make any general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or shall admit in writing its inability to pay its or their respective debts generally as they become due; or

(8) any other Event of Default provided in the supplemental indenture under which such series of Securities is issued or in the form of Security for such series; provided that if any such default or acceleration referred to in clause (7) above shall cease or be cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, then the Event of Default hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon cured.
Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities in accordance with the provisions of Article II, if an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in Sections 5.1(5) or 5.1(6)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Issuer (and to the Trustee if given by such Securityholders), may declare the principal of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Sections 5.1(5) or 5.1(6) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as may be specified by the terms thereof) shall automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any holder, become immediately due and payable.
At any time after the principal of the Securities of that series shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if: (i) the Issuer has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all the Securities of that series and the principal of , and premium, if any, on any and all Securities of that series that shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest upon such principal and premium, if any, and, to the extent that such payment is enforceable under applicable law, upon overdue installments of interest, at the rate per annum or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) expressed in the Securities of that series (or at the respective rates of interest or Yields to Maturity of all the Securities, as the case may be) to the date of such payment or deposit) and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 6.6, and (ii) any and all Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal on Securities of that series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) that shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 5.10.
For all purposes under this Indenture, unless otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities, if a portion of the principal of any Original Issue Discount Securities shall have been accelerated and declared due and payable pursuant to the provisions hereof, then, from and after such declaration, unless such declaration has been rescinded and annulled, the principal amount of such Original Issue
 
Discount Securities shall be deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, and payment of such portion of the principal thereof as shall be due and payable as a result of such acceleration, together with interest, if any, thereon and all other amounts owing thereunder, shall constitute payment in full of such Original Issue Discount Securities.
Section 5.2 . (1) The Issuer covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in the payment of any installment of interest on any of the Securities of any series when such interest shall have become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30 days or (b) in case default shall be made in the payment of all or any part of the principal of any of the Securities of any series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of the Securities of such series or upon any redemption or by declaration or otherwise, then upon demand of the Trustee, the Issuer will pay to the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders of the Securities of such series the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on all Securities of such series, and such Coupons, for principal or interest, as the case may be (with interest to the date of such payment upon the overdue principal and, to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of interest at the same rate as the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities) specified in the Securities of such series); and in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct.
Collection of Indebtedness by Trustee; Trustee May Prove Debt
Until such demand is made by the Trustee, the Issuer may pay the principal of and interest on the Securities of any series to the registered holders, whether or not the Securities of such series be overdue.
(2) In case the Issuer shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities, wherever situated the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable.
(3) In case there shall be pending proceedings relative to the Issuer or any other obligor upon the Securities under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable Federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor, or in case of any other comparable judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise:
(a) to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and interest (or, if the Securities of any series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of such series) owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities of any series, and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for compensation to the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee, except as caused by his own negligence or willful misconduct) and of the Securityholders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuer or other obligor upon the Securities, or to the creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor,
 
(b) unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of the holders of the Securities of any series in any election of a trustee or a standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable proceedings, and
(c) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the Securityholders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and any trustee, receiver, or liquidator, custodian or other similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Securityholders to make payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to the Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of any series or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding except, as aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar person.
(4) All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Securities of any series or Coupons appertaining to such Securities, may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities or Coupons or the production thereof in any trial or other proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment, subject to the payment of the expenses, disbursements and compensation of the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities in respect of which such action was taken.
(5) In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and also any proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the Holders of the Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities in respect to which such action was taken, and it shall not be necessary to make any Holders of such Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities parties to any such proceedings.
Section 5.3 . Any moneys collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article in respect of any series shall, subject to the subordination provisions hereof, be applied in the following order at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such moneys on account of principal or interest, upon presentation of the several Securities and Coupons appertaining to such Securities in respect of which monies have been collected and stamping (or otherwise noting) thereon the payment, or issuing Securities of such series in reduced principal amounts in exchange for the presented Securities of like series if only partially paid, or upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

Suits for Enforcement
Section 5.5 . In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case the Issuer and the Trustee shall be restored respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Issuer, the Trustee and the Securityholders shall continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.
Restoration of Rights on Abandonment of Proceedings
Section 5.6 . No Holder of any Security of any series or of any Coupon appertaining thereto shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to institute any action or proceeding at law or in equity or in bankruptcy or otherwise upon or under or with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official or for any other remedy hereunder, unless such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written notice of default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action or proceedings in its own name as trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby and the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have failed to institute any such action or proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.9; it being understood and intended, and being expressly covenanted by the taker and Holder of every Security or Coupon with every other taker and Holder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of Securities of any series or Coupons appertaining to such Securities shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other such Holder of Securities or Coupons appertaining to such Securities, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all Holders of Securities of the applicable series and Coupons appertaining to such Securities.

Unconditional Right of Securityholders to Institute Certain Suits
Section 5.8 . Except as provided in Section 5.6, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities or Coupons is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
Powers and Remedies Cumulative; Delay or Omission Not Waiver of Default
No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of Securities or Coupons to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; and, subject to Section 5.6, every power and remedy given by this Indenture or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities or Coupons may be exercised from time to time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities or Coupons.

Control by Holders of Securities
Nothing in this Indenture shall impair the right of the Trustee in its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the Trustee and which is not inconsistent with such direction or directions by Securityholders.
Section 5.10 .

In the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all such Securities shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Waiver of Past Defaults
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, and not to have occurred for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
 
Section 5.11 .. The Trustee shall, within ninety days after the occurrence of a default with respect to the Securities of any series, give notice of all defaults with respect to that series actually known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee (1) if any Unregistered Securities of that series are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof, by publication at least once an Authorized Newspaper in London and (2) to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 313(c) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, unless in each case such defaults shall have been cured before the mailing or publication of such notice (the term "defaults" for the purpose of this Section being hereby defined to mean any event or condition which is, or with notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default); provided that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the Securities of such series, or in the payment of any sinking fund installment on such series, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a trust committee of directors or trustees and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Securityholders of such series.
Trustee to Give Notice of Default, but May Withhold in Certain Circumstances
Section 5.12 . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security or Coupon by his or her acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder or group of Securityholders of any series holding in the aggregate more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series, or, in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clause (4) or (8) of Section 5.1 (if the suit relates to Securities of more than one but less than all series), 10% in aggregate principal amount of Securities then Outstanding and affected thereby, or in the case of any suit relating to or arising under clause (4) or (8) (if the suit under clause (4) or (8) relates to all the Securities then Outstanding), (5), (6) or (7) of Section 5.1, 10% in aggregate principal amount of all Securities then Outstanding, or to any suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security on or after the due date expressed in such Security or any date fixed for redemption.
Right of Court to Require Filing of Undertaking to Pay Costs
Section 6.1 . (1) With respect to the Holders of any series of Securities issued hereunder, the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a particular series and after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred with respect to such series, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the Trustee shall exercise with respect to such series of Securities such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.
Duties and Responsibilities of the Trustee; During Default; Prior to Default
(2) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of any series and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect to such series which may have occurred:
(i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall
 
not be liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and
(ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any statements, certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture; but in the case of any such statements, certificates or opinions which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein unless specifically required by this Indenture).
(b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and
(c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the direction of the Holders pursuant to Section 5.9 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.
(d) the Trustee shall not be required to take notice, and shall not be deemed to have notice, of any default or Event of Default hereunder, except Events of Default described in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of Section 5.1 hereof, unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall be notified specifically of the default or Event of Default on a written instrument or document delivered to it at its Corporate Trust Office, which such notice references the Securities and this Indenture, by the Issuer or by the Holders of at least 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities then Outstanding. In the absence of delivery of notice satisfying those requirements, the Trustee may assume conclusively that there is no default or Event of Default, except as noted.
(3) None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there shall be reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such liability is not reasonably assured to it.
The provisions of this Section 6.1 are in furtherance of and subject to Section 315 of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or effecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.
Section 6.2 . In furtherance of and subject to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and subject to Section 6.1:
Certain Rights of the Trustee
(1) the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, Officer's Certificate or any other certificate, resolutions, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, coupon, security or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

Such corporation or banking association shall have a place of business or an affiliate with a place of business in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York if there be such a corporation or association in such location willing to act upon reasonable and customary terms and conditions. If such corporation or association publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation or association shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 6.10.
Persons Eligible for Appointment as Trustee
The provisions of this Section 6.9 are in furtherance of and subject to Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
Section 6.10 . (1) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may at any time resign with respect to one or more or all series of Securities by giving written notice of resignation to the Issuer and (a) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, by giving notice of such resignation to the Holders thereof, by publication, at the Issuer's expense, at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and (b) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, by mailing notice of such resignation to the Holders thereof who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313(c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee and (c) by mailing notice of such resignation to the Holders of then Outstanding Registered Securities of each series affected at their addresses as they shall appear on the registry books. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the applicable series by written instrument in duplicate, executed by authority of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor Trustee or Trustees. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed with respect to any series and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition, at the Issuer's expense, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee, or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of the applicable series for at least six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 5.12, on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor Trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor Trustee.
Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor Trustee
(2) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:
(a) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 with respect to any series of Securities after written request therefor by the
 
Issuer or by any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months; or
(b) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.9 and Section 310(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Securityholder; or
(c) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting with respect to any series of Securities, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver or liquidator of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation;
then, in any such case, the Issuer may remove the Trustee with respect to the applicable series of Securities and appoint a successor Trustee for such series by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor Trustee, or, subject to the provisions of Section 315(e) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, any Securityholder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security or Securities of such series for at least six months may on behalf of himself or herself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such series. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee. If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
(3) The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with respect to Securities of such series and appoint a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series by delivering to the Trustee so removed, to the successor Trustee so appointed and to the Issuer the evidence provided for in Section 7.1 of the action in that regard taken by such Securityholders.
(4) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee with respect to any series and any appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to such series pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 6.10 shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided in Section 6.11.
Section 6.11 . Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.10 shall execute and deliver to the Issuer and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee with respect to all or any applicable series shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and obligations with respect to such series of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee for such series hereunder; but, nevertheless, on the written request of the Issuer or of the successor Trustee, upon payment of its charges then unpaid, the Trustee ceasing to act shall, subject to Section 3.3, pay over to the successor Trustee all moneys at the time held by it hereunder and shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Issuer shall execute any and all instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights and powers. Any Trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a prior claim upon all property or funds held or collected by such Trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.6.
Acceptance of Appointment by Successor Trustee
If a successor Trustee is appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the predecessor Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any applicable series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the predecessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series as to which the predecessor Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor Trustee, and shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental
 
indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be Trustee of a trust or trusts under separate indentures.
No successor Trustee with respect to any series of Securities shall accept appointment as provided in this Section 6.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9.
Upon acceptance of appointment by any successor Trustee as provided in this Section 6.11, the Issuer shall give notice thereof (1) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof, by publication of such notice at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York and (2) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313(c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, by mailing such notice to such Holders at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall make such information available to the Issuer for such purpose) and (3) if any Registered Securities of a series affected are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof, by mailing such notice to such Holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the registry books. If the acceptance of appointment is substantially contemporaneous with the resignation, then the notice called for by the preceding sentence may be combined with the notice called for by Section 6.10. If the Issuer fails to give such notice within ten days after acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee, the successor Trustee shall cause such notice to be given at the expense of the Issuer.
Section 6.12 . Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided that such corporation shall be qualified under Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and eligible under the provisions of Section 6.9, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding.
Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business of Trustee
In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture any of the Securities of any series shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee and deliver such Securities so authenticated; and, in case at that time any of the Securities of any series shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the name of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificate shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities of such series or in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided, that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or to authenticate Securities of any series in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.
Section 6.13 . The Trustee shall comply with Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, excluding any creditor relationship listed in Section 311(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be subject to Section 311(a) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 to the extent indicated therein.
Preferential Collection of Claims Against the Issuer
Section 6.14 . As long as any Securities of a series remain Outstanding, the Trustee may, by an instrument in writing, appoint with the approval of the Issuer an authenticating agent (the "Authenticating Agent") which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities, including Securities issued upon exchange, registration of transfer, partial redemption or pursuant to Section 2.9. Securities of each such series authenticated by such Authenticating Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee. Whenever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities of any series by the Trustee or to the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent for such series and a Certificate of Authentication executed on behalf
Appointment of Authenticating Agent

Such Authenticating Agent shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or of any State, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 (determined as provided in Section 6.9 with respect to the Trustee) and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority.
Any corporation into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted, or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate agency business of any Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent with respect to all series of Securities for which it served as Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent. Any Authenticating Agent may at any time, and if it shall cease to be eligible shall, resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Issuer.
Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.14 with respect to one or more series of Securities, the Trustee shall upon receipt of an Order appoint a successor Authenticating Agent and the Issuer shall provide notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner and to the extent provided in Section 11.4. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested with all rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as Authenticating Agent. The Issuer agrees to pay to the Authenticating Agent for such series from time to time reasonable compensation. The Authenticating Agent for the Securities of any series shall have no responsibility or liability for any action taken by it as such at the direction of the Trustee.
Sections 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6 and 7.3 shall be applicable to any Authenticating Agent.
Section 7.1 . Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by a specified percentage in principal amount of the Securityholders of any or all series may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such specified percentage of Securityholders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee. Proof of execution of any instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Article.
Evidence of Action Taken by Securityholders
Section 7.2 . Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder or his or her agent or proxy may be proved in the following manner:
Proof of Execution of Instruments and of Holding of Securities
(1) The fact and date of the execution by any Holder of any instrument may be proved by the certificate of any notary public or other officer of any jurisdiction authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds or administer oaths that the person executing such instruments acknowledged to him or her the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness to such execution sworn to before any such notary or other such officer. Where such execution is by or on behalf of any legal entity other than an individual, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of the authority of the person executing the same.
(2) The fact of the holding by any Holder of an Unregistered Security of any series, and the identifying number of such Security and the date of his or her holding the same, may be proved by the
 
production of such Security or by a certificate executed by any trust company, bank, banker or recognized securities dealer wherever situated satisfactory to the Trustee, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. Each such certificate shall be dated and shall state that on the date thereof a Security of such series bearing a specified identifying number was deposited with or exhibited to such trust company, bank, banker or recognized securities dealer by the person named in such certificate. Any such certificate may be issued in respect of one or more Unregistered Securities of one or more series specified therein. The holding by the person named in any such certificate of any Unregistered Securities of any series specified therein shall be presumed to continue for a period of one year from the date of such certificate unless at the time of any determination of such holding (a) another certificate bearing a later date issued in respect of the same Securities shall be produced, or (b) the Securities of such series specified in such certificate shall be produced by some other person, or (c) the Securities of such series specified in such certificate shall have ceased to be Outstanding. Subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the fact and date of the execution of any such instrument and the amount and numbers of Securities of any series held by the person so executing such instrument and the amount and numbers of any Security or Securities for such series may also be proven in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee for such series or in any other manner which the Trustee for such series may deem sufficient.
(3) In the case of Registered Securities, the ownership of such Securities shall be proved by the Security register or by a certificate of the Security registrar.
The Issuer may set a record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders of Registered Securities of any series entitled to vote or consent to any action referred to in Section 7.1, which record date may be set at any time or from time to time by notice to the Trustee, for any date or dates (in the case of any adjournment or reconsideration) not more than 60 days nor less than five days prior to the proposed date of such vote or consent, and thereafter, notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, with respect to Registered Securities of any series, only Holders of Registered Securities of such series of record on such record date shall be entitled to so vote or give such consent or revoke such vote or consent.
Section 7.3 . The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may deem and treat the person in whose name any Security shall be registered upon the Security register for such series as the absolute owner of such Security (whether or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and, subject to the provisions of this Indenture, interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee may treat the Holder of any Unregistered Security and the Holder of any Coupon as the absolute owner of such Unregistered Security or Coupon (whether or not such Unregistered Security or Coupon shall be overdue) for the purpose of receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes and neither the Issuer, the Trustee, nor any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments so made to any such person, or upon his or her order, shall be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Unregistered Security or Coupon.
Holders to Be Treated as Owners
Section 7.4 . In determining whether the Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any or all series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver under this Indenture, Securities which are owned by the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities with respect to which such determination is being made shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver only Securities which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not the Issuer or any other obligor upon the
Securities Owned by Issuer Deemed Not Outstanding
 
Securities or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any other obligor on the Securities. In case of a dispute as to such right, the advice of counsel shall be full protection in respect of any decision made by the Trustee in accordance with such advice. Upon request of the Trustee, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an Officer's Certificate listing and identifying all Securities, if any, known by the Issuer to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above-described Persons; and, subject to Sections 6.1 and 6.2, the Trustee shall be entitled to accept such Officer's Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all Securities not listed therein are Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination.
Section 7.5 . At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 7.1, of the taking of any action by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action, any Holder of a Security the serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included among the serial numbers of the Securities the Holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice at the Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in this Article, revoke such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the Holder of any Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders and owners of such Security and of any Securities issued in exchange or substitution therefor or on registration of transfer thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon any such Security. Any action taken by the Holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any or all series, as the case may be, specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Issuer, the Trustee and the Holders of all the Securities affected by such action.
Right of Revocation of Action Taken
Section 8.1 . (1) In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by this Indenture, the Issuer, when authorized by a resolution of its Board of Directors (which resolution may provide general terms or parameters for such action and may provide that the specific terms of such action may be determined in accordance with or pursuant to an Order), and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto, which comply with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as then in effect, without the consent of the Holders, for one or more of the following purposes:
Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Securityholders
(a) to convey, transfer, assign, mortgage or pledge to the Trustee as security for the Securities of one or more series any property or assets;
(b) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer, or successive successions, and the assumption by the successor Person of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the Issuer pursuant to Article IX;
(c) to add to the covenants of the Issuer such further covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions as the Issuer shall consider to be for the benefit of the Holders of Securities or Coupons, and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any such additional covenants, restrictions, conditions or provisions an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein set forth; provided, that in respect of any such additional covenant, restriction, condition or provision such supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such an Event of Default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such an Event of Default or may limit the right of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series to waive such an Event of Default;
 
(d) to cure any ambiguity, inconsistency, omission or defect to any provision contained herein or in any supplemental indenture;

(2) The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Issuer in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained and to accept the conveyance, transfer, assignment, mortgage or pledge of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into any such supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

(3) Upon the request of the Issuer, accompanied by the Officer's Certificate and Opinion of Counsel stating that the execution of such supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence of the consent of the Holders of the Securities as aforesaid and other documents, if any, required by Section 7.1, the Trustee shall join with the

(4) It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Securityholders under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
(5) Promptly after the execution by the Issuer and the Trustee of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section, the Issuer shall give notice thereof (a) if any Registered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof by mailing a notice thereof by first-class mail to such Holders at their addresses as they shall appear on the Security register, (b) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to the Holders thereof who have filed their names and addresses with the Trustee pursuant to Section 313 (c)(2) of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, by mailing a notice thereof by first-class mail to such Holders at such addresses as were so furnished to the Trustee and (c) if any Unregistered Securities of a series affected thereby are then Outstanding, to all Holders thereof, by publication of a notice thereof at least once in an Authorized Newspaper in London, and such notice shall set forth in general terms the substance of such supplemental indenture.

Effect of Supplemental Indenture
Section 8.4 . The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall be given, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article VIII complies with the applicable provisions of this Indenture.

Applicability of Legal Defeasance Provisions; Issuer's Option to Effect Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance
 
Outstanding Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with the conditions set forth below in this Article.
Section 10.4 . Upon the Issuer's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Issuer shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 10.6 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto which shall thereafter be deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 10.7 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in clause (2) of this Section and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 10.6(a) and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities when payments are due, (2) the Issuer's obligations with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 3.2 and 3.3, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Issuer may exercise its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option (if any) to have Section 10.5 applied to such Securities. Following a Legal Defeasance, payment of such Securities may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default.
Legal Defeasance and Discharge
Section 10.5 . Upon the Issuer's exercise of its option (if any) to have this Section applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Issuer shall be released from its obligations under Article IX, Sections 3.7 and 3.9, inclusive, and any covenants provided pursuant to Sections 2.3(18), 8.1(c) or 8.1(e) for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Sections 5.1(4) (with respect to any of Article IX, Sections 3.7 and 3.9, inclusive, and any such covenants provided pursuant to Sections 2.3(18), 8.1(c) or 8.1(e)) and 5.1(8) shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 10.6 are satisfied (hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto, the Issuer may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 5.1(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.

principal of and any premium and interest and (Y) any mandatory sinking fund payments applicable to such Securities on the day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities and any Coupons appertaining thereto.

(d) The Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate to the effect that it has been informed by the relevant securities exchange(s) that neither such Securities nor any other Securities of the same series, if then listed on any securities exchange, will be delisted as a result of such deposit.
(e) No event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect to such Securities or any other Securities shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any such event specified in Sections 5.1(5) and 5.1(6), at any time on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after such 90th day).
(f) Such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement, to which the Issuer is a party or by which it is bound.
(g) The Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent with respect to such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to be Held in Trust
 
become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, but such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.

Section 10.10 . If the Trustee or the paying agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or government authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and such Securities from which the Issuer has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 10.4 or 10.5 shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or paying agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 10.7 with respect to such Securities in accordance with this Article; provided, however, that if the Issuer makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer shall be subrogated to the rights (if any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.

Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Registered Securities, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) by electronic means or in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder entitled thereto, at his or her last address as it appears in the Security register. In any case where notice to such Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
In case, by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail service, it shall be impracticable to mail notice to the Issuer when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee shall be deemed to be a sufficient giving of such notice.
Section 11.5 . Upon any application or demand by the Issuer to the Trustee to take any action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Issuer shall furnish to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or demand as to which the furnishing of such documents is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or demand, no additional certificate or opinion need be furnished.

Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by counsel, unless such officer knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous. Any certificate, statement or opinion of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, information with respect to which is in the possession of the Issuer, upon the certificate, statement or opinion of or representations by an officer or officers of the Issuer, unless such counsel actually knows that the certificate, statement or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.
Any certificate, statement or opinion of an officer of the Issuer or of counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to accounting matters, upon a certificate or opinion of or representations by an accountant or firm of accountants in the employ of the Issuer, unless such officer or counsel, as the case may be, knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the accounting matters upon which his or
 
her certificate, statement or opinion may be based as aforesaid are erroneous, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know that the same are erroneous.

Payments Due on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays
Section 11.7 .

For purposes of this Section 11.11, "Market Exchange Rate" shall mean the noon Dollar buying rate in New York City for cable transfers of that currency as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; provided, however, in the case of ECUs, Market Exchange Rate shall mean the rate of exchange determined by the Commission of the European Communities (or any successor thereto) as published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (such publication or any successor publication, the "Journal"). If such Market Exchange Rate is not available for any reason with respect to such currency, the Trustee shall use, in its sole discretion and without liability on its part, such quotation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or, in the case of ECUs, the rate of exchange as published in the Journal, as of the most recent available date, or quotations or, in the case of ECUs, rates of exchange from one or more major banks in The City of New York or in the country of issue of the currency in question, which for purposes of the ECU shall be Brussels, Belgium, or such other quotations or, in the case of ECU, rates of exchange as the Trustee shall deem appropriate. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply in determining the equivalent principal amount in respect of Securities of a series denominated in a currency other than Dollars in connection with any action taken by
Securities in a Foreign Currency or in ECU
 
Holders of Securities pursuant to the terms of this Indenture including without limitation any determination contemplated in Section 5.1(7).
All decisions and determinations of the Trustee regarding the Market Exchange Rate or any alternative determination provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive to the extent permitted by law for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Issuer and all Holders.
Section 11.12 . The Issuer agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so under applicable law, that (1) if for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert the sum due in respect of the principal of or interest on the Securities of any series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which a judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered, unless such day is not a Business Day, then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the Business Day preceding the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered and (2) its obligations under this Indenture to make payments in the Required Currency (a) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with subsection (1)), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (b) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for the purpose of recovering in the Required Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Required Currency so expressed to be payable and (c) shall not be affected by judgment being obtained for any other sum due under this Indenture.
Judgment Currency
Section 11.13 . If any provision of this Indenture or of the Securities, or the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance, shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of this Indenture or of the Securities, or the application of such provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to whom or which it is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
Separability Clause
Section 11.14 . In no event shall the Trustee be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly, forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances, nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware) services; it being understood that the Trustee shall use reasonable efforts which are consistent with accepted practices in the banking industry to resume performance as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
Force Majeure
Section 12.1 . The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to the Securities of any series which are redeemable before their maturity or to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3 for Securities of such series.
Applicability of Article
Section 12.2 . Notice of redemption to the Holders of Registered Securities of any series to be redeemed as a whole or in part at the option of the Issuer shall be given by mailing notice of such redemption by first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption to such Holders of Securities of such series at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the registry books. Notice of redemption to the Holders of Unregistered Securities to be redeemed as a whole or in part shall be given
Notice of Redemption; Partial Redemptions
 
by electronic means. Any notice which is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice. Failure to give notice by mail, or any defect in the notice to the Holder of any Security of a series designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Security of such series.
The notice of redemption to each such Holder shall identify the securities to be redeemed (including CUSIP numbers), shall specify, the principal amount of each Security of such series held by such Holder to be redeemed, the date fixed for redemption, the redemption price, the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Securities and, in the case of Securities with Coupons attached thereto, of all Coupons appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, that such redemption is pursuant to the mandatory or optional sinking fund, or both, if such be the case, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in such notice and that on and after said date interest thereon or on the portions thereof to be redeemed will cease to accrue. In case any Security of a series is to be redeemed in part only the notice of redemption shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for redemption, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
The notice of redemption of Securities of any series to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer's request and provision of the notice information, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Issuer.
On or before 10:00 a.m., New York City time, the redemption date specified in the notice of redemption given as provided in this Section, the Issuer will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own paying agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 3.3) an amount of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the Securities of such series so called for redemption at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee at least 30 days prior to the date fixed for redemption (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed. In case of a redemption at the election of the Issuer prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee, prior to the giving of any notice of redemption to Holders pursuant to this Section, an Officer's Certificate stating that such restriction has been complied with.
If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select, in such manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair, Securities of such Series to be redeemed in whole or in part. Securities may be redeemed in part in multiples equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of such series or any multiple thereof. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in writing of the Securities of such series selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities of such series selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities of any series shall relate, in the case of any Security redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Security which has been or is to be redeemed.
Section 12.3 . If notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, and on and after said date (unless the Issuer shall default in the payment of such Securities at the redemption price, together with interest accrued to said date) interest on the Securities or portions of Securities so called for redemption shall cease to accrue, and the unmatured Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto shall be void, and, except as provided in Sections 3.3 and 6.5, such Securities shall cease from and after the date fixed for redemption to be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and the Holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Securities except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption. On presentation and surrender of such Securities at a place of payment specified in said notice, together
Payment of Securities Called for Redemption
 
with all Coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the date fixed for redemption, said Securities or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Issuer at the applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided that payment of interest becoming due on or prior to the date fixed for redemption shall be payable in the case of Securities with Coupons attached thereto, to the Holders of the Coupons for such interest upon surrender thereof, and in the case of Registered Securities, to the Holders of such Registered Securities registered as such on the relevant record date subject to the terms and provisions of Sections 2.3 and 2.7 hereof.
If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for redemption at the rate of interest or Yield to Maturity (in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security) borne by such Security.
If any Security with Coupons attached thereto is surrendered for redemption and is not accompanied by all appurtenant Coupons maturing after the date fixed for redemption, such Security may be redeemed after deducting from the redemption price any amount equal to the face amount of all such missing Coupons, or the surrender of such missing Coupon or Coupons may be waived by the Issuer and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any paying agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any paying agent any such missing Coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the redemption price, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that interest represented by Coupons shall be payable as provided in Section 2.9 and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 2.3, only upon presentation and surrender of those Coupons.
Upon presentation of any Security redeemed in part only, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to or on the order of the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Issuer, a new Security or Securities of such series, of authorized denominations, in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.
Section 12.4 . Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for selection for redemption if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 10 days prior to the last date on which notice of redemption may be given as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such written statement as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.
Exclusion of Certain Securities from Eligibility for Selection for Redemption
Section 12.5 . (1) The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of the Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of the Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking fund payment". The date on which a sinking fund payment is to be made is herein referred to as the "sinking fund payment date."
Mandatory and Optional Sinking Funds
(2) In lieu of making all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment with respect to any series of Securities in cash, the Issuer may at its option (a) deliver to the Trustee Securities of such series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except upon redemption pursuant to the mandatory sinking fund) by the Issuer or receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired (except as aforesaid) by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10, (b) receive credit for optional sinking fund payments (not previously so credited) made pursuant to this Section, or (c) receive credit for Securities of such series (not previously so credited) redeemed by the Issuer through any optional redemption provision contained in the terms of such series. Securities so delivered or credited shall be received or credited by the Trustee at the sinking fund redemption price specified in such Securities.
 
(3) On or before the 30th day next preceding each sinking fund payment date for any series, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate (which need not contain the statements required by Section 11.5) (a) specifying the portion of the mandatory sinking fund payment to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion to be satisfied by credit of Securities of such series and the basis for such credit, (b) stating that none of the Securities of such series has theretofore been so credited, (c) stating that no defaults in the payment of interest or Events of Default with respect to such series have occurred (which have not been waived or cured) and are continuing and (d) stating whether or not the Issuer intends to exercise its right to make an optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series and, if so, specifying the amount of such optional sinking fund payment which the Issuer intends to pay on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Any Securities of such series to be credited and required to be delivered to the Trustee in order for the Issuer to be entitled to credit therefor as aforesaid which have not theretofore been delivered to the Trustee shall be delivered for cancellation pursuant to Section 2.10 to the Trustee with such Officer's Certificate (or reasonably promptly thereafter if acceptable to the Trustee). Such Officer's Certificate shall be irrevocable and upon its receipt by the Trustee the Issuer shall become unconditionally obligated to make all the cash payments or payments therein referred to, if any, on or before the next succeeding sinking fund payment date. Failure of the Issuer, on or before any such 30th day, to deliver such Officer's Certificate and Securities specified in this paragraph, if any, shall not constitute a default but shall constitute, on and as of such date, the irrevocable election of the Issuer (i) that the mandatory sinking fund payment for such series due on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date shall be paid entirely in cash without the option to deliver or credit Securities of such series in respect thereof and (ii) that the Issuer will make no optional sinking fund payment with respect to such series as provided in this Section.
(4) If the sinking fund payment or payments (mandatory or optional or both) to be made in cash on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date plus any unused balance of any preceding sinking fund payments made in cash shall exceed $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) or a lesser sum in Dollars (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) if the Issuer shall so request with respect to the Securities of any particular series, such cash shall be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date to the redemption of Securities of such series at the sinking fund redemption price together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption. If such amount shall be $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) or less and the Issuer makes no such request then it shall be carried over until a sum in excess of $50,000 (or the equivalent thereof in any Foreign Currency or ECU) is available. The Trustee shall select, in the manner provided in Section 12.2, for redemption on such sinking fund payment date a sufficient principal amount of Securities of such series to absorb said cash, as nearly as may be, and shall (if requested in writing by the Issuer) inform the Issuer of the serial numbers of the Securities of such series (or portions thereof) so selected. Securities shall be excluded from eligibility for redemption under this Section if they are identified by registration and certificate number in an Officer's Certificate delivered to the Trustee at least 30 days prior to the sinking fund payment date as being owned of record and beneficially by, and not pledged or hypothecated by either (a) the Issuer or (b) an entity specifically identified in such Officer's Certificate as directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer. The Trustee, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer (or the Issuer, if it shall so request the Trustee in writing) shall cause notice of redemption of the Securities of such series to be given in substantially the manner provided in Section 12.2 (and with the effect provided in Section 12.3) for the redemption of Securities of such series in part at the option of the Issuer. The amount of any sinking fund payments not so applied or allocated to the redemption of Securities of such series shall be added to the next cash sinking fund payment for such series and, together with such payment, shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Any and all sinking fund moneys held on the stated maturity date of the Securities of any particular series (or earlier, if such maturity is accelerated), which are not held for the payment or redemption of particular Securities of such series shall be applied, together with other moneys, if necessary, sufficient for the purpose, to the payment of the principal of, and interest on, the Securities of such series at maturity.
(5) On or before each sinking fund payment date, the Issuer shall pay to the Trustee in cash or shall otherwise provide for the payment of all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption on Securities to be redeemed on the next following sinking fund payment date.
 
(6) The Trustee shall not redeem or cause to be redeemed any Securities of a series with sinking fund moneys or give any notice of redemption of Securities for such series by operation of the sinking fund during the continuance of a default in payment of interest on such Securities or of any Event of Default except that, where the giving of notice of redemption of any Securities shall theretofore have been made, the Trustee shall redeem or cause to be redeemed such Securities, provided that it shall have received from the Issuer a sum sufficient for such redemption. Except as aforesaid, any moneys in the sinking fund for such series at the time when any such default or Event of Default shall occur, and any moneys thereafter paid into the sinking fund, shall, during the continuance of such default or Event of Default, be deemed to have been collected under Article V and held for the payment of all such Securities. In case such Event of Default shall have been waived as provided in Section 5.10 or the default cured on or before the 30th day preceding the sinking fund payment date in any year, such moneys shall thereafter be applied on the next succeeding sinking fund payment date in accordance with this Section to the redemption of such Securities.
Section 13.1 . The Issuer, for itself, its successors and assigns, covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Security or Coupon, by its acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that the payment of the principal of and interest on, each and all of the Securities and any Coupons is hereby expressly subordinated, to the extent and in the manner hereinafter in this Article XIII set forth, in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.
Agreement to Subordinate
Section 13.2 .
Rights of Senior Indebtedness in the Event of Insolvency, Etc. of the Issuer
(1) In the event of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, and any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceedings in connection therewith, relative to the Issuer or to its creditors, as such, or to its property, and in the event of any proceedings for voluntary liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Issuer, whether or not involving insolvency or bankruptcy, and in the event of any execution sale, then the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full of principal thereof and interest due thereon (including, without limitation, except to the extent, if any, prohibited by mandatory provisions of law, post-petition interest in any such proceedings) in money or money's worth of all Senior Indebtedness before the Holders are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of or interest on the indebtedness evidenced by the Securities or of the Coupons, and to that end the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive for application in payment thereof any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash or property or securities, which may be payable or deliverable in connection with any such proceedings or sale in respect of the principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons other than securities of the Issuer as reorganized or readjusted or securities of the Issuer or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in this Article XIII with respect to the Securities or Coupons, to the payment of all indebtedness of the nature of Senior Indebtedness, provided that the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not altered by such reorganization or readjustment;
(2) In the event and during the continuation of any default in payment of any Senior Indebtedness or if any event of default, as therein defined, shall exist under any Senior Indebtedness or any agreement pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness is issued, no payment of the principle of or interest on the Securities or Coupons shall be made and the Issuer covenants that it will, upon ascertaining any such default or event of default, provide written notice to the Trustee of such default or event of default;
(3) In the event that the Securities of any series are declared due and payable before their expressed maturity because of the occurrence of an Event of Default (under circumstances when the provisions of Subsection (1) of this Section 13.2 shall not be applicable), the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in full in money or money's worth of such Senior
 
Indebtedness before such Holders are entitled to receive any payment on account of the principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons; and
(4) No holder of Senior Indebtedness shall be prejudiced in his or her right to enforce subordination of the Securities or Coupons by any act or failure to act on the part of the Issuer.
Section 13.3 . In the event that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.2, any payment or distribution of assets of the Issuer of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities (other than securities of the Issuer as reorganized or readjusted or securities of the Issuer or any other corporation provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment the payment of which is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in this Article XIII with respect to the Securities or Coupons, to the payment of all indebtedness of the nature of Senior Indebtedness, provided that the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness are not altered by such reorganization or readjustment) shall be received by the Holders or by the Trustee for their benefit in connection with any proceedings or sale referred to in Subsection (1) of Section 13.2 before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in money or money's worth, such payment or distribution shall be paid over to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or their representative or representatives or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture under which any instruments evidencing any of such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, ratably according to the aggregate amounts remaining unpaid on account of the Senior Indebtedness held or represented by each, for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid until all such Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in money or money's worth, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.
Payment Over of Proceeds Received on Securities
From and after the payment in full in money or money's worth of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders (together with the holders of any other indebtedness of the Issuer which is subordinate in right of payment to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, which is not subordinate in right of payment to the Securities or Coupons and which by its terms grants such right of subrogation to the holder thereof) shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments or distributions of assets or securities of the Issuer applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the Securities and any Coupons shall be paid in full, and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no such payments or distributions to the holders of Senior Indebtedness of assets or securities, which otherwise would have been payable or distributable to Holders, shall, as between the Issuer, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders, be deemed to be a payment by the Issuer to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that the provisions of this Article XIII are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand, and nothing contained in this Article XIII or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities or Coupons is intended to or shall impair as between the Issuer, its creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders, the obligation of the Issuer, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to the Holders the principal of and interest on the Securities or Coupons as and when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or to affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of the Issuer other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or the holder of any Security or Coupon from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture subject to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness, under Section 13.2, to receive cash, property or securities of the Issuer otherwise payable or deliverable to the holders of the Securities or Coupons.
Upon any distribution or payment in connection with any proceedings or sale referred to in Subsection (1) of Section 13.2, the Trustee, subject as between the Trustee and the Holders to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2 hereof, shall be entitled to rely upon a certificate of the liquidating trustee or agent or other Person making any distribution or payment to the Trustee for the purpose of ascertaining the holders of Senior Indebtedness entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, the amount of such Senior Indebtedness or the amount payable thereon, the amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this Article XIII. In the event that the Trustee determines, in good faith, that further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this Section 13.3,
 
the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such Person, as to the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution, and as to other facts pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Section 13.3, and if such evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.
The Trustee, however, shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and shall not be liable to any such holders if it shall in good faith, mistakenly or otherwise, pay over or distribute to Holders or the Issuer or any other Person moneys or assets to which any holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled by virtue of Article XIII of this Indenture or otherwise. With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants or obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article and no implied covenants or obligations with respect to holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee.
Section 13.4 . Nothing contained in this Article XIII or elsewhere in this Indenture, or in any of the Securities or in any Coupon, shall prevent at any time, (1) the Issuer from making payments at any time of principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons, except under the conditions described in Section 13.2 or during the pendency of any proceedings or sale therein referred to, provided, however, that payments of principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons shall only be made by the Issuer within three Business Days of the due dates for such payments or (2) the application by the Trustee of any moneys deposited with it hereunder to the payment of or on account of the principal of or interest on the Securities or Coupons, if at the time of such deposit the Trustee did not have written notice in accordance with Section 13.6 of any event prohibiting the making of such deposit by the Issuer or if in the event of redemption, the Trustee did not have such written notice prior to the time that the notice of redemption pursuant to Section 12.2 was given (which notice of redemption shall in no event be given more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption).
Payments to Holders
Section 13.5 . Each Holder by his or her acceptance of a Security or Coupon authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article XIII and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes, including, in the event of any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of the Issuer (whether in bankruptcy, insolvency or receivership proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise) tending towards liquidation of the business and assets of the Issuer, the immediate filing of a claim for the unpaid balance of such Holder's Securities or Coupons in the form required in said proceedings and cause said claim to be approved.
Holders of Securities Authorize Trustee to Effectuate Subordination of Securities
Section 13.6 . Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article XIII or any other provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with the knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the making of any payment of moneys to the Trustee, unless and until the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Issuer or from the holder or the representative of any class of Senior Indebtedness; provided, however, that if at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such monies may become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of either the cash amount payable at maturity or interest on any Security or Coupon), the Trustee shall not have received with respect to such monies the notice provided for in this Section 13.6, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such monies and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary, which may be received by it on or after such two Business Days prior to such date.
Notice to Trustee
Section 13.7 . Subject to the provisions of Section 6.13, the Trustee shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article XIII with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which may at any time be held by it, to the same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent of its right as such holder.
Trustee May Hold Senior Indebtedness
 
Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.6.
Section 13.8 . In case at any time any paying agent other than the Trustee shall be appointed by the Issuer and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee" as used in this Article XIII in such case (unless the context shall otherwise require) be construed as extending to and including such paying agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such paying agent were named in this Article XIII in place of the Trustee.
Applicability of Article XIII to Paying Agents

Section 1.04 . So long as no Event of Default with respect to the Subordinated Debentures has occurred or is continuing, the Company shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to defer the payment of interest on the
Option to Defer Interest Payments
 
Subordinated Debentures for one or more Optional Deferral Period (as defined below) of up to five consecutive years, provided, however, that no Optional Deferral Period shall extend beyond the Maturity Date, any earlier accelerated maturity date arising from an Event of Default or any other earlier redemption of the Subordinated Debentures. If the Company has paid all deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) on the Subordinated Debentures, the Company shall have the right to elect to begin a new Optional Deferral Period pursuant to this Section 1.04.
During any Optional Deferral Period, interest shall continue to accrue on the Subordinated Debentures, and deferred interest payments shall accrue additional interest at the then applicable interest rate on the Subordinated Debentures, compounded quarterly as of each Interest Payment Date to the extent permitted by applicable law. No interest otherwise due during an Optional Deferral Period shall be due and payable on the Subordinated Debentures until the end of such Optional Deferral Period except upon an acceleration or redemption of the debentures during such deferral period.
At the end of any Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all deferred interest (including compounded interest thereon) on the Subordinated Debentures to the Persons in whose names the Subordinated Debentures are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date with respect to the Interest Payment Date at the end of such Optional Deferral Period.
At the end of five years following the commencement of any Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall pay all accrued and unpaid deferred interest, including compounded interest thereon, and the Company's failure to pay all such accrued and unpaid deferred interest, including compounded interest thereon, for a period of 30 days after the conclusion of such five-year period shall result in an Event of Default giving rise to a right of acceleration. If, at the end of any Optional Deferral Period, the Company shall have paid all deferred interest due on the Subordinated Debentures, including compounded interest, the Company may again defer interest payments on the Subordinated Debentures as described above.
"Optional Deferral Period" means the period commencing on an Interest Payment Date with respect to which the Company defers interest pursuant to this Section 1.04 and ending on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of that Interest Payment Date and (ii) the next Interest Payment Date on which the Company has paid all deferred and unpaid amounts (including compounded interest on such deferred amounts) and all other accrued interest on the Subordinated Debentures.
The Company shall give written notice of its election to commence or continue any Optional Deferral Period to the Trustee and the Holders of the Subordinated Debentures at least one Business Day and not more than 60 Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date. Such notice shall be given to the Trustee and each Holder of Subordinated Debentures at such Holder's address by first-class mail, postage prepaid. In addition, the Company's failure to pay interest on the Subordinated Debentures on any Interest Payment Date will itself constitute the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period unless the Company pays such interest within five Business Days after any such Interest Payment Date, whether or not the Company provides a notice of deferral.
 
After the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period and until the Company has paid all accrued and unpaid interest on the Subordinated Debentures, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of the Company's capital stock other than:

(c) as a result of a reclassification of any series or class of the Company's capital stock, or the exchange or conversion of one class or series of the Company's capital stock for or into another class or series of the Company's capital stock;
(d) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Company's capital stock pursuant to an acquisition or the conversion or exchange provisions of that capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged;
(e) dividends or distributions of the Company's capital stock, or rights to acquire capital stock, or repurchases or redemptions of capital stock, in each case solely from the issuance or exchange of capital stock;
(f) any declaration of a dividend in connection with the implementation of a shareholder rights plan, or issuances of capital stock under any such plan in the future, or redemptions or repurchases of any rights outstanding under a shareholder rights plan; or
(g) acquisitions of the Company's capital stock in connection with acquisitions of businesses made by the Company (which acquisitions are made by the Company in connection with the satisfaction of indemnification obligations of the sellers of such businesses).
In addition, after the commencement of an Optional Deferral Period until the Company has paid all accrued and unpaid interest on the Subordinated Debentures, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any of the Company's debt securities or guarantees that rank equally with the Subordinated
 
Debentures ("Parity Securities") or junior to the Subordinated Debentures other than (i) any payment of current or deferred interest on Parity Securities made pro rata to the amounts due on such Parity Securities (including the Subordinated Debentures) and any payments of deferred interest on Parity Securities that, if not made, would cause the Company to breach the terms of the instrument governing such Parity Securities or (ii) any payment of principal on Parity Securities necessary to avoid a breach of the instrument governing such Parity Securities.

The Securities represented by this Debenture are one of the series designated on the face hereof as 5.50% Subordinated Debentures due 2052 (the "Subordinated Debentures"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $450,000,000 (or to $517,500,000 if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Subordinated Debentures pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement (as defined in Section 1.02 of the First Supplemental Indenture)); provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Subordinated Debentures, as provided in the First Supplemental Indenture. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
So long as no Event of Default (as defined in Section 1.12 of the First Supplemental Indenture) with respect to the Subordinated Debentures has occurred or is continuing, the Company shall have the right, pursuant to Section 1.04 of the First Supplemental Indenture, at any time and from time to time, to defer the payment of interest on the Subordinated Debentures for one or more consecutive interest periods that do not exceed five years for any single Optional Deferral Period, subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
This Debenture is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for Subordinated Debentures of this series in definitive registered form only as provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Subordinated Debentures shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Subordinated Debentures may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. For the avoidance of doubt, Event of Default is defined in Section 1.12 of the First Supplemental Indenture, which amends and restates in its entirety Section 5.1 of the Original Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the Subordinated Debentures under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Subordinated Debentures at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Subordinated Debentures, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past
 
defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Debenture shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Debenture and of any Subordinated Debentures issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Debenture.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Debenture and (ii) restrictive covenants upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Debenture.
The Subordinated Debentures will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in $25 increments:
 
 
 
"Tax Event" means that the Company will have received an opinion of counsel, rendered by a law firm of nationally recognized standing that is experienced in such matters, stating that, as a result of any:
 
 
 
 
which amendment or change is enacted or effective or which pronouncement or decision is announced or which challenge is asserted against the Company or becomes publicly known on or after the original issue date of the Subordinated Debentures, there is more than an insubstantial increase in the risk that interest accruable or payable by the Company on the Subordinated Debentures is not, or will not be, deductible by the Company in whole or in part, for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
"Rating Agency Event" means that any nationally recognized statistical rating organization within the meaning of Section 3(a)(62) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that then publishes a rating for the Company (a "rating agency") amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities such as the Subordinated Debentures, which amendment, clarification or change results in (a) the shortening of the length of time the Subordinated Debentures are assigned a particular level of equity credit by that rating agency as compared to the length of time they would have been assigned that level of equity credit by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial issuance of the Subordinated Debentures; or (b) the lowering of the equity credit (including up to a lesser amount) assigned to the Subordinated Debentures by that rating agency compared to the equity credit assigned by that rating agency or its predecessor on the initial issuance of the Subordinated Debentures.
"Treasury Rate" means (1) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities", for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (2) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the quarterly equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such date of redemption. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third business day preceding the date of redemption.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Subordinated Debentures to September 26, 2017, to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Subordinated Debentures to September 26, 2017.
 
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their successors, appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any date of redemption for the Subordinated Debentures (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such date of redemption, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Trustee obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., and their respective successors and one other primary U.S. government securities dealer (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that (1) if any of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and Goldman, Sachs & Co., or their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer and (2) if the Company fails to select a substitute within a reasonable period of time, then the substitute will be a Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with the Company.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any date of redemption, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such date of redemption.
On and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Subordinated Debentures or any portion of the Subordinated Debentures called for redemption, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption amount.
Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the redemption price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
The Company shall notify the Trustee of the redemption price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said redemption price. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the redemption price, on and after the date of redemption, interest will cease to accrue on the Subordinated Debentures or portions thereof called for redemption.
 
If less than all of the Subordinated Debentures are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall determine, in such manner as it deems appropriate and fair, the principal amount of such Subordinated Debentures held by each beneficial owner of such Subordinated Debentures to be redeemed. The Trustee may select Subordinated Debentures and portions of Subordinated Debentures in amounts of $25 and whole multiples of $25 in excess thereof.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest, other than as described in Section 1.04 of the First Supplemental Indenture, on this Debenture at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Debenture is registrable in the Security register, upon surrender of this Debenture for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Subordinated Debentures, of authorized denominations and of like tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Debenture for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Subordinated Debenture on behalf of the Company ("Paying Agent") and the Security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Debenture is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Debenture be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Subordinated Debentures are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $25 and integral multiples of $25 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Subordinated Debentures are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Debentures of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Subordinated Debenture or Subordinated Debentures to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Debenture, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule, law statute or constitutional provision, or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof.
 
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Debenture shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
This Debenture shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the state of New York.

We do not express any opinion with respect to the law of any jurisdiction other than Opined on Law or as to the effect of any such Opined on Law on the opinions herein stated.

binding obligations of the Company, entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms.
The opinion set forth above is subject to the following further qualifications, assumptions and limitations:
(i) the opinion stated herein is limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer, preference and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law); and

Ladies and Gentlemen:
You have requested our opinion with respect to the U.S. federal income tax classification of the 5.50% Subordinated Debentures ("") issued by Aflac Incorporated, a Georgia corporation (the ""), on September 26, 2012, as more fully described in the prospectus supplement dated September 21, 2012 (the ""), to the base prospectus contained in the registration statement on Form S-3ASR (File No. 333-181089) filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, 2012.
Debentures
Company
Prospectus Supplement
 
 
The Debentures incorporate the following key terms.
 
The Debentures have a maturity of 40 years.
The Debentures are subordinated to all of the Company's senior indebtedness on the terms set forth in the subordinated indenture pursuant to which the debentures will be issued (the ""), and the Debentures rank pari passu with trade creditors and other subordinated indebtedness expressly stated to rank pari passu with the Debentures.
Subordinated Indenture
 
The Debentures will bear interest at an annual rate equal to 5.50%, payable quarterly in arrears. The Company may, so long as there is no event of default under the Subordinated Indenture, elect to defer interest payments on the Debentures for one or more consecutive interest periods at any time for up to 5 years (""). Interest may not, however, be deferred beyond the maturity date or the redemption date of the Debentures.
Optional Deferral
During any Optional Deferral, interest will compound quarterly on any interest deferred pursuant to the Optional Deferral right and the Company will generally be prohibited from (i) paying dividends on any class of its equity, or redeem, purchase or acquire any shares of Company capital stock, (ii) paying principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repaying, repurchasing or redeeming any other classes of Company debt securities that rank equally with or junior to the Debentures (other than payments that if not made would cause a breach of the terms of such instruments) or (iii) making any guarantee payments with respect to the securities described in (ii).
 
The Debentures are redeemable or otherwise repayable by the Company, in whole or in part, after September 26, 2017, for cash at the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures to be redeemed plus accumulated and unpaid interest on a compounded basis, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company.
 
The Company may redeem the Debentures in whole, but not in part, from the date of issuance until September 26, 2017 at any time within 90 days after there is a Tax Event (as defined below), in cash at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount redeemed plus accumulated and unpaid interest on a compounded basis. A Tax Event occurs if, as a result of (a) a change in the tax law or any interpretation thereof, (b) a threatened challenge asserted in connection with an audit of the Company or (c) a threatened challenge asserted in writing against any other taxpayer that has raised capital through the issuance of securities that are substantially similar to the Debentures, there is more than an insubstantial risk that interest paid or accrued on the Debentures is not deductible, in whole or in part, by the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
 
The Company may redeem the Debentures in whole, but not in part, from the date of issuance until September 26, 2017 at any time within 90 days after a Rating Agency Event (as defined below), in cash at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures being redeemed, and (b) the present value of the scheduled remaining payments through September 26, 2017, discounted at a rate equal to a applicable treasury rate, plus 40 basis points. A Rating Agency Event means a change to the methodology or criteria that were employed by an applicable rating agency for purposes of assigning equity credit to securities such as the Debentures on the date of initial issuance of the Debentures, which change either (i) shortens the period of time during which equity credit pertaining to the Debentures would have been in effect or (ii) reduces the amount of equity credit assigned to the Debentures by the applicable rating agency.
 
The Debentures will have no voting rights in the Company.
 
The Company's failure to pay principal or interest on the Debentures when due and the Company's bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or reorganization will result in a default on the Debentures. In addition, failures to observe or perform any other covenant or obligation in the indenture for 90 days after notice, or failure to make certain other debt payments, may, upon notice from the trustee or holders of 25% of the principal of the Debentures, also constitute an event of default. An event of default will give holders the right to accelerate principal and interest on the Debentures.
 
The Prospectus Supplement and the Subordinated Indenture provide that each holder of the Debentures will be deemed to have agreed to treat the Debentures as indebtedness for all U.S. federal, state and local tax purposes.
The Company has paid regular dividends on its common stock in each of the past 35 years, and the Company has increased dividends every year since 1983. The Company has assets and projected cash flows sufficient to demonstrate that it is capable of servicing the Debentures pursuant to their terms without exercising its right to Optional Deferral. The Company and its subsidiaries have aggregate long term debt liabilities of approximately $3,672 million and shareholders' equity of
 
approximately $14,179 million as of June 30, 2012. The Company and its subsidiaries had net earnings of $1,964 million in 2011, $2,344 million in 2010 and $1,497 in 2009. The Debentures were issued with investment grade debt ratings of Baa1 provided by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. and BBB provided by Standard & Poor's Corporation.

AFLAC INCORPORATED ANNOUNCES RECORD THIRD QUARTER RESULTS,
RAISES 2012 OPERATING EPS OUTLOOK,
AFFIRMS 2013 OPERATING EPS OBJECTIVE,
UPWARDLY REVISES AFLAC JAPAN SALES OUTLOOK,
INCREASES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND 6.1%
COLUMBUS, Georgia - October 23, 2012 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its third quarter results.
Reflecting a slightly weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, total revenues rose 14.4% to $6.8 billion in the third quarter of 2012, compared with $6.0 billion in the third quarter of 2011. Net earnings were $1.0 billion, or $2.16 per diluted share, compared with $736 million, or $1.57 per share, a year ago, benefiting from realized investment gains and a lower annual effective tax rate.
Net earnings in the third quarter of 2012 included after-tax realized investment gains, net of realized investment losses, of $186 million, or $.39 per diluted share, compared with after-tax net losses of $34 million, or $.08 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011. After-tax net realized investment gains from sales and redemptions of securities in the quarter were $187 million, or $.40 per diluted share. The majority of the gains from sales and redemptions came from selling Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), which generated after-tax gains of $192 million. After-tax realized investment losses from impairments in the quarter were $63 million, or $.14 per diluted share. These losses primarily resulted from impairments taken on securities issued by Swedbank and BBVA. After-tax net realized investment gains from derivatives in the quarter were $62 million, or $.13 per diluted share.
Throughout this document, certain prior period numbers have been restated to reflect the retrospective adoption of revised accounting guidance for accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts (deferred acquisition costs, or DAC).
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities include: foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated; foreign currency swaps associated with the company's senior and subordinated notes; and foreign currency forwards used in hedging foreign exchange risk on U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $831 million, compared with $770 million in the third quarter of 2011. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 7.3% to $1.77 in the quarter, compared with $1.65 per share a year ago. The yen impact on operating earnings for the quarter was nil per share. In the quarter, the company revised its estimate of the full-year effective tax rate, which increased operating earnings by $17.5 million, or $.04 per diluted share. In addition, the company recognized an income tax benefit of $29.5 million, or $.06 per diluted share, primarily resulting from the favorable outcome of a routine tax exam for the years 2008 and 2009. Together, the impact from these items benefited operating earnings by $47 million, or $.10 per diluted share.
Results for the first nine months of 2012 benefited from a slightly stronger yen. Total revenues were up 17.3% to $19.0 billion, compared with $16.2 billion in the first nine months of 2011. Net earnings were $2.3 billion, or $4.87 per diluted share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $2.98 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2011. Operating earnings for the first nine months of 2012 were $2.4 billion, or $5.12 per diluted share, compared with $2.3 billion, or $4.82 per diluted share, in 2011. Excluding the benefit of $.06 per share from the stronger yen, operating earnings per diluted share rose 5.0% for the first nine months of 2012.
Total investments and cash at the end of September 2012 were $124.2 billion, compared with $109.3 billion at June 30, 2012, benefiting from securities lending activities totaling approximately $6.5 billion, continued strong cash flows at Aflac Japan, and the stronger yen at the end of the period.
Shareholders' equity was $16.0 billion at September 30, 2012, compared with $14.2 billion at June 30, 2012. Shareholders' equity at the end of the third quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $2.3 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain of $1.5 billion at the end of June 2012. Shareholders' equity per share was $34.10 at September 30, 2012, compared with $30.29 per share at June 30, 2012. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the third quarter was 27.0%. On an operating basis (excluding realized investment losses and the impact of derivative gains/losses on net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 25.2% for the third quarter.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 10.0% in the third quarter of 2012. Premium income in yen rose 10.7%, benefiting from strong sales of WAYS, Aflac Japan's unique hybrid whole-life product. Net investment income increased 3.7%. The pretax operating profit margin decreased from the third quarter of 2011, declining from 21.6% to 19.3%, continuing to reflect a higher benefit ratio partially offset by a lower expense ratio. Pretax operating earnings in yen decreased 1.4%. For the first nine months of the year, premium income in yen increased 9.4%, and net investment income rose 6.4%. Total revenues in yen were up 9.0%, and pretax operating earnings grew 1.4%.
The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the third quarter of 2012 was 78.64, or 1.1% weaker than the average rate of 77.78 in the third quarter of 2011. For the first nine months, the average exchange rate was 79.47, or 1.3% stronger than the rate of 80.50 a year ago. The slightly weaker yen/dollar exchange rate lowered Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for the third quarter, but Aflac Japan's growth rates in dollar terms for the first nine months were slightly magnified by a stronger yen/dollar exchange rate.
Premium income in dollars rose 9.6% to $4.4 billion in the third quarter. Net investment income was up 2.7% to $713 million. Total revenues increased 8.9% to $5.1 billion. Pretax operating earnings decreased 2.5% to $994 million. For the first nine months, premium income was $12.8 billion, or 11.1% higher than a year ago. Net investment income rose 7.8% to $2.1 billion. Total revenues were up 10.7% to $14.9 billion. Pretax operating earnings were $3.0 billion, or 2.7% higher than a year ago.
Aflac Japan again produced significant sales growth in the quarter. New annualized premium sales rose 31.7% to a record 55.7 billion in the third quarter of 2012. In dollar terms, new annualized premium sales were $692 million. Bank channel sales were again very strong, generating 26.9 billion in sales in the third quarter, an increase of 85.3% over the third quarter of 2011. Sales of WAYS increased 108.3% over the third quarter of 2011.
For the first nine months of the year, new annualized premium sales were up 43.4% to 161.3 billion, or $2.0 billion.
 
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues rose 5.2% to $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Premium income increased 5.2% to $1.3 billion, and net investment income was up 3.5% to $153 million. The pretax operating profit margin expanded from 16.0% a year ago to 18.4%, reflecting lower benefit and expense ratios. Pretax operating earnings were $260 million, an increase of 21.5% for the quarter. For the first nine months, total revenues were up 5.2% to $4.2 billion and premium income rose 5.3% to $3.7 billion. Net investment income increased 4.2% to $457 million. Pretax operating earnings were $789 million, or 11.5% higher than a year ago.
    
Aflac U.S. total new annualized premium sales decreased 1.5% to $335 million for the quarter. Persistency in the quarter improved to 76.9% from 75.9% a year ago. For the first nine months of the year, total new sales rose 1.5% to $1.0 billion.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors approved an increase in the cash dividend effective with the fourth quarter 2012 payment. The fourth quarter dividend of $.35 per share is payable on December 3, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 14, 2012. This represents a 6.1% increase in the quarterly cash dividend and marks the 30
th
consecutive year in which the dividend has been increased.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's third quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: We remain pleased with Aflac's financial performance for the first nine months of 2012. Aflac Japan had another impressive quarter, continuing tremendous sales momentum, especially through the bank channel. Aflac Japan's third quarter production came in much stronger than we expected and set an all-time record for new annualized premium sales for the fifth quarter in a row.
Keep in mind, we continue to face tougher sales comparisons in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we anticipate fourth quarter sales to be somewhat suppressed due to the reduction in the discounted advance premium rate that was effective on October 22. As a result, we expect sales to be in the range of flat to up 15% in the fourth quarter. Taking all of this this into account, we are upwardly revising our sales expectations for Aflac Japan and expect a full year sales increase of 30% to 35%.
From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. continues to perform very well this year. While new sales growth has been constrained, our top-line growth has been consistently strong throughout the year, primarily reflecting an improvement in persistency with each quarter. Aflac U.S. has experienced top- and bottom-line growth that's been better than expected. However, sales remain challenging. With more than 90% of our accounts coming through the small business market, we continue to see that segment as particularly vulnerable to economic uncertainty. Given this backdrop and with three quarters of the year completed, I think it's likely Aflac U.S. sales for 2012 will be roughly flat.
We continued to make progress with the transformation of our Global Investment Division. While we still view Europe as an area of potential investment risk, I strongly believe our derisking efforts have better positioned our portfolio to accommodate market volatility. Our recently employed U.S. corporate bond program has been an effective means for enhancing our new money yields in Japan. You'll recall that our initial objective was to invest 200 billion in the third quarter, or about $2.5 billion, in U.S. dollar-denominated, publicly traded corporate bonds, and then hedge the currency risk. We completed that pilot program and are very pleased with the results. This strategy provides greater liquidity, enhances flexibility for our portfolio and increases the opportunities to diversify the investment of our significant cash flows beyond JGBs, with the objective of producing higher returns.
Our capital ratios continue to be extremely strong. Although we have not yet finalized our statutory financial statements, we estimate our RBC ratio was between 575% and 600% at the end of September, which is up from our year-end ratio of 493%. We expect that Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio remained at the high end or above our 500% to 600% target.
Given the strength of our capital ratios and parent company liquidity, we plan on purchasing up to $100 million of our shares in the fourth quarter of this year.
Our strong capital position has also enabled us to increase our cash dividend for the 30
th
consecutive year. I am very pleased with the action by the board of directors to increase the quarterly dividend by 6.1%, effective with the fourth quarter of 2012. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with operating earnings before the impact of foreign currency translation.
I believe we've done a very good job in managing our operations, including expense control. Our fourth quarter earnings will be impacted by higher expenses in the U.S. and Japan operations, particularly on marketing and IT initiatives. We continue
to believe we are well-positioned to achieve our stated earnings objective of 3% to 6% increase in operating earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of foreign currency. In the second quarter, we guided toward the low end of the range. However, reflecting the lower annual effective tax rate, we now expect operating earnings for 2012 to be better than we previously communicated. If the yen averages 80 to the dollar for the last three months of the year, we would expect reported operating earnings for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.51 per diluted share. Under that same exchange rate assumption, we would expect full year operating earnings of $6.58 to $6.63 per diluted share. We believe that is reasonable and achievable. Importantly, we continue to believe 2013 operating earnings per share will increase 4% to 7% on a currency neutral basis.

COLUMBUS, Georgia - February 5, 2013 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its fourth quarter results.
Reflecting the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, revenues rose 6.6% to $6.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with $6.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net earnings were $581 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared with $538 million, or $1.15 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012 included after-tax realized investment losses, net of realized investment gains, of $111 million, or $.23 per diluted share, compared with net after-tax losses of $146 million, or $.30 per diluted share, a year ago. After-tax realized investment losses in the quarter were $217 million, or $.45 per diluted share. These losses primarily resulted from impairments taken on securities issued by the Republic of Tunisia and UniCredit SpA (HVB Funding Trusts). After-tax realized investment gains from securities transactions in the quarter were $76 million, or $.16 per diluted share. On an after-tax basis, hedge costs related to dollar investments of Aflac Japan were $3 million in the quarter, or $.01 per diluted share. Realized after-tax net investment gains from other derivative and hedging activities in the quarter were $33 million, or $.07 per diluted share.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities include: foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated; foreign currency swaps associated with the company's senior and subordinated notes; and foreign currency forwards used in hedging foreign exchange risk on U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with the company's insurance operations, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, which includes the Aflac Japan dollar investment program, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $697 million, compared with $684 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 2.1% to $1.48 in the quarter, compared with $1.45 a year ago. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate decreased operating earnings per diluted share by $.04 for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact from the weaker yen, operating earnings per share increased 4.8%.
For the full year, total revenues were up 14.4% to $25.4 billion, compared with $22.2 billion a year ago. Net earnings were $2.9 billion, or $6.11 per diluted share, compared with $1.9 billion, or $4.12 per share, in 2011. Operating earnings for the full year were $3.1 billion, or $6.60 per diluted share, compared with $2.9 billion, or $6.27 per diluted share, in 2011. Operating earnings per diluted share rose 5.3% for the year. For the year, the yen/dollar exchange rate was relatively flat. Excluding a $.01 per share benefit from the impact from foreign currency, operating earnings per diluted share rose 5.1% for the year.
Total investments and cash at the end of December 2012 were $118.2 billion, compared with $124.2 billion at September 30, 2012. Although negatively impacted by the weaker yen, total investments and cash continued to benefit from strong cash flows.
In the fourth quarter and for the full year, Aflac repurchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock. At the end of December, the company had 22.4 million shares available for purchase under its share repurchase authorization.
Shareholders' equity was $16.0 billion at December 31, 2012, which was unchanged from September 30, 2012. Shareholders' equity at the end of the fourth quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $2.6 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain of $2.3 billion at the end of September 2012. Shareholders' equity per share was $34.16 at December 31, 2012, compared with $34.10 per share at September 30, 2012. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the fourth quarter was 14.5%. On an operating basis (excluding total net realized gains/losses in net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 20.6% for the fourth quarter.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2012. Premium income in yen rose 11.2%, benefiting from strong sales of WAYS, Aflac Japan's unique hybrid whole-life product. Net investment income increased 5.2%.

The board of directors declared the first quarter cash dividend. The first quarter dividend of $.35 per share is payable on March 1, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2013.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's fourth quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: We are very pleased with Aflac's financial performance for both the quarter and year. As the year progressed, operating earnings per diluted share were better than expected, and we finished the year toward the high end of our objective of a 3% to 6% increase before the impact of foreign currency. That, in part, reflected the benefits of a deferred coupon payment in the first quarter, as well as a lower annual effective tax rate. As we had conveyed in the third quarter, following nine months of restrained expenditures, we increased spending on IT and marketing initiatives in the fourth quarter to further enhance our business.
 
Aflac Japan generated a solid quarter and another outstanding year. The tremendous sales we generated in 2012 were again largely driven by the bank channel. Following five straight record quarters of new annualized premium sales growth, sales in the fourth quarter slowed, in large part due to extremely difficult comparisons. Additionally, as we expected, sales were negatively impacted by the reduction of the discounted advance premium rate that was effective October 22, 2012. Importantly, Aflac Japan's impressive sales for the full year were in line with our expectation we communicated in the third quarter.
From a financial perspective, Aflac U.S. continued to perform well for the quarter and for the full year. While new sales growth has been constrained, our top-line growth has been consistently strong throughout the year, primarily reflecting an improvement in persistency. With more than 90% of our accounts coming through the small business market, we continue to see that segment as particularly vulnerable to economic uncertainty. Given this backdrop, Aflac U.S. 2012 sales results were in line with our most recent guidance of roughly flat sales for the year.
We continued to make progress with the transformation of our Global Investment Division. As I have said before, I strongly believe our derisking activities have better positioned our portfolio to accommodate market volatility. At the same time, we've been able to enhance our new money yields, primarily through our U.S. corporate bond program. Following the success of this program in the third quarter, our objective was to invest roughly two-thirds of Aflac Japan's fourth quarter investment cash flow, or about $3.1 billion, in U.S. dollar-denominated, publicly traded corporate bonds, and then hedge the currency risk. We remain very pleased with the results this quarter. This strategy provides greater liquidity, enhances flexibility for our portfolio and increases the opportunities to diversify the investment of our significant cash flows beyond Japanese Government Bonds, with the objective of producing higher returns.
The strength of our capital ratios demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of our policyholders and bondholders. We previously conveyed that our goal was to end 2012 with an RBC ratio in the range of 400% and 500%. While we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements, we believe our RBC ratio at year-end was significantly higher than our target. Additionally, we expect that Aflac Japan's solvency margin ratio at year-end improved over the solvency margin ratio at September 30, 2012, which was 628%, and was well above the 2012 range we had targeted of 500% to 600%.
Given the strength of our capital ratios and parent company liquidity, we resumed our share repurchase activities by buying approximately $100 million of our shares in the fourth quarter of 2012, and it is our current plan to purchase $400 to $600 million of our shares in 2013. Understand, unless an extraordinary event occurs, we intend to purchase a minimum of $400 million of our shares this year.
As we look ahead to 2013 sales opportunities, we expect Aflac U.S. sales to be flat to up 5% for 2013. We also expect Aflac Japan sales of third sector cancer and medical products to be flat to up 5%.
I want to reiterate that our objective for 2013 has not changed: To increase operating earnings per diluted share 4% to 7%, or approximately $6.86 to $7.06 per share, on a currency neutral basis.
Therefore, if the yen/dollar exchange rate averages 90 yen for the full year, it's likely operating earnings per diluted share will be $6.37 to $6.57 for 2013. I would point out that 2013 earnings comparisons to 2012 will be more difficult because earnings in 2012 were significantly better than we originally anticipated.

AFLAC INCORPORATED ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS,
DECLARES SECOND QUARTER CASH DIVIDEND,
AFFIRMS 2013 OPERATING EPS TARGET
 
COLUMBUS, Georgia - April 24, 2013 - Aflac Incorporated today reported its first quarter results.
Reflecting the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate, revenues were relatively unchanged at $6.2 billion during the first quarter of 2013, compared with a year ago. Net earnings were $892 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, compared with $785 million, or $1.68 per share, a year ago.
Net earnings in the first quarter of 2013 included after-tax realized investment gains, net of realized investment losses, of $102 million, or $.21 per diluted share, compared with net after-tax losses of $29 million, or $.06 per diluted share, a year ago. After-tax realized investment losses from impairments in the quarter were $35 million, or $.08 per diluted share. After-tax realized investment gains from securities transactions in the quarter were $77 million, or $.16 per diluted share. On an after-tax basis, hedging costs related to certain dollar investments of Aflac Japan were $3 million in the quarter, or $.01 per diluted share. Realized after-tax net investment gains from other derivative and hedging activities in the quarter were $63 million, or $.14 per diluted share.
Aflac believes that an analysis of operating earnings, a non-GAAP financial measure, is vitally important to an understanding of the company's underlying profitability drivers. Aflac defines operating earnings as the profits derived from operations before realized investment gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items. Aflac's derivative activities primarily include: foreign currency, interest rate and credit default swaps in variable interest entities that are consolidated; foreign currency swaps associated with the company's senior and subordinated notes; and foreign currency forwards used in hedging foreign exchange risk on U.S. dollar-denominated securities. Management uses operating earnings to evaluate the financial performance of Aflac's insurance operations because realized gains and losses from securities transactions, impairments, and derivative and hedging activities, as well as nonrecurring items, tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with the company's insurance operations, and therefore may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in Aflac's insurance operations.
Furthermore, because a significant portion of Aflac's business is in Japan, where the functional currency is the yen, the company believes it is equally important to understand the impact on operating earnings from translating yen into dollars. Aflac Japan's yen-denominated income statement is translated from yen into dollars using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and the balance sheet is translated using the exchange rate at the end of the period. However, except for a limited number of transactions, which includes the Aflac Japan dollar investment program, the company does not actually convert yen into dollars. As a result, Aflac views foreign currency as a financial reporting issue and not as an economic event for the company or its shareholders. Because changes in exchange rates distort the growth rates of operations, readers of Aflac's financial statements are also encouraged to evaluate financial performance excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The chart toward the end of this release presents a comparison of selected income statement items with and without foreign currency changes to illustrate the effect of currency.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $790 million, compared with $814 million in the first quarter of 2012. Operating earnings per diluted share decreased 2.9% to $1.69 in the quarter, compared with $1.74 a year ago. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate decreased operating earnings per diluted share by $.15 for the first quarter. Excluding the impact from the weaker yen, operating earnings per share increased 5.7%.
Total investments and cash at the end of March 2013 were $107.4 billion, compared with $118.2 billion at December 31, 2012. Total investments and cash were negatively impacted by the weaker yen and the conclusion of a six-month securities lending program that began in the third quarter of 2012.
In the first quarter, Aflac repurchased approximately $150 million, or about three million shares, of its common stock. At the end of March, the company had 19.4 million shares available for purchase under its share repurchase authorization.
During the first quarter, the company refined its methodology for valuing privately issued securities held in its consolidated investment portfolio. The adoption of this new valuation methodology, combined with changes in market conditions, reduced shareholders' equity at March 31, 2013, by $582 million, compared with December 31, 2012. Shareholders' equity was $15.5 billion, or $33.34 per share, at March 31, 2013, compared with $16.0 billion, or $34.16 per share, at December 31, 2012. Shareholders' equity at the end of the first quarter included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $2.0 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain of $2.6 billion at the end of December 2012. The annualized return on average shareholders' equity in the first quarter was 22.6%. On an operating basis (excluding total net realized investment gains/losses in net earnings, and unrealized investment and derivative gains/losses in shareholders' equity), the annualized return on average shareholders' equity was 23.4% for the first quarter.
AFLAC JAPAN
Aflac Japan's total revenues in yen were up 9.7% in the first quarter of 2013. Premium income in yen rose 9.8%. Net investment income increased 7.3%. Investment income growth in yen terms was magnified by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate because approximately 40% of Aflac Japan's first quarter investment income was dollar-denominated.
The pretax operating profit margin increased slightly over the first quarter of 2012, improving from 21.3% to 21.5%. Pretax operating earnings in yen increased 10.7%.
For the first quarter, Aflac Japan's results in dollar terms were suppressed by the weaker yen/dollar exchange rate. The average yen/dollar exchange rate in the first quarter of 2013 was 92.59, or 14.0% weaker than the average rate of 79.59 in the first quarter of 2012.
Reflecting the weaker average yen in the first quarter, premium income in dollars decreased 5.9% to $3.9 billion. Net investment income in the first quarter was $674 million, or 7.6% lower than 2012. Total revenues decreased 5.9% to $4.6 billion. Pretax operating earnings declined 4.8% to $989 million.
In the first quarter, total new annualized premium sales rose 2.6% to 53.8 billion, or $578 million. Third sector sales, cancer and medical products combined, decreased 7.1% in the quarter. During the same period, bank channel sales decreased 13.2%. Ordinary life sales, including WAYS which decreased 1.9%, were up 7.3% for the quarter. This result was better than expected and was primarily driven by consumers who wanted to make insurance purchases of first sector products ahead of the rate increase effective April 2, 2013.
AFLAC U.S.
Aflac U.S. total revenues increased 3.9% to $1.4 billion in the first quarter. Premium income increased 4.0% to $1.3 billion, and net investment income was up 3.4% to $157 million. The pretax operating profit margin decreased slightly from 19.6% a year ago to 19.5%. Pretax operating earnings were $281 million, an increase of 3.6% for the quarter.
    
Aflac U.S. total new annualized premium sales decreased 5.2% to $332 million. Additionally, persistency in the quarter was 74.7%, which was unchanged from a year ago.
DIVIDEND
The board of directors declared the second quarter cash dividend. The second quarter dividend of $.35 per share is payable on June 3, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22, 2013.
OUTLOOK
Commenting on the company's first quarter results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Daniel P. Amos stated: Although the underlying strong results were masked by a significantly weaker yen, we are pleased with our overall results in the first
quarter of 2013. Aflac Japan produced solid financial results that exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Aflac Japan's overall sales were up due to the advanced purchases of products prior to a scheduled premium increase. Third sector sales on the other hand, were down for the first quarter as expected. However, we believe consumer response to our third sector products will be strong in the second half of 2013. As such, we continue to expect that Aflac Japan's sales of third sector products will be flat to up 5% for the year.
While Aflac U.S. sales declined in the quarter, we believe sales will be weighted more toward the latter half of the year. Therefore, we are retaining our objective of a flat to 5% sales increase for the year. The foundation of Aflac U.S. is strong and we are focused on expanding our reach to employees at companies of all sizes. We continue to look for opportunities to leverage our strong brand and relevant product portfolio in the evolving health care environment.
Low investment yields, particularly in Japan, remain a significant challenge. As such, we continue to invest a significant portion of our cash flows in U.S. corporate bonds. This strategy provides greater liquidity, enhances flexibility for our portfolio and increases the opportunity to diversify the investment of our significant cash flows beyond Japanese Government Bonds, with the objective of producing higher returns. In light of 10-year JGB yields hitting historical lows, we want to be flexible in our asset allocation. Given significant changes impacting financial markets including Japanese interest rates and the yen/dollar exchange rate, our investment team is carefully monitoring Japan's monetary and fiscal policies to evaluate investment options related to our JGB asset allocation.
The strength of our regulatory capital ratios demonstrates our commitment to maintaining financial strength on behalf of our policyholders and bondholders. As we have communicated over the past several years, sustaining strong RBC and SMR ratios remains a priority for us. While we have not yet completed our statutory financial statements for the first quarter, we estimate our quarterly RBC ratio at March 31 was above our 2012 year-end ratio of 630%. We believe Aflac Japan's SMR will also improve over its year-end 2012 level of 669%.
We communicated last quarter our intention is to purchase $400 to $600 million of our shares this year. We purchased approximately $150 million of our shares in the first quarter of 2013. Given the strength of our capital ratios and parent company liquidity, we are even more comfortable with that range.
Reflecting the underlying strength of the business, we still expect to have another good year for Aflac. I want to reiterate that our objective for 2013 has not changed: To increase operating earnings per diluted share 4% to 7%, or approximately $6.86 to $7.06 per share, on a currency neutral basis.
Assuming we achieve our earnings objective and the yen averages 95 to 100 to the dollar for 2013, we would expect to report operating earnings of $5.99 to $6.37 per diluted share for the full year. Additionally, for the second quarter of 2013, using the same currency assumptions, we expect operating earnings will be in the range of $1.41 to $1.56 per diluted share.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a "safe harbor" to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those informational statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those included in the forward-looking statements. We desire to take advantage of these provisions. This document contains cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected herein, and in any other statements made by company officials in communications with the financial community and contained in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Forward-looking statements are not based on historical information and relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Furthermore, forward-looking information is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties. In particular, statements containing words such as "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "goal," "objective," "may," "should," "estimate," "intends," "projects," "will," "assumes," "potential," "target" or similar words as well as specific projections of future results, generally qualify as forward-looking. Aflac undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements. We caution readers that the following factors, in addition to other factors mentioned from time to time, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy; governmental actions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets; defaults and credit downgrades of securities in our investment portfolio; impairment of financial institutions; credit and other risks associated with Aflac's investment in perpetual securities; differing judgments applied to investment valuations; significant valuation judgments in determination of amount of impairments taken on our investments; limited availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments; concentration of our investments in any particular single-issuer or sector; concentration of business in Japan; increased derivative activities; ongoing changes in our industry; exposure to significant financial and capital markets risk; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; significant changes in investment yield rates; deviations in actual experience from pricing and reserving assumptions; subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to Aflac Incorporated; changes in law or regulation by governmental authorities; ability to attract and retain qualified sales associates and employees; decreases in our financial strength or debt ratings; ability to continue to develop and implement improvements in information technology systems; interruption in telecommunications, information technology, and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems; changes in U.S. and/or Japanese accounting standards; failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security; level and outcome of litigation; ability to effectively manage key executive succession; catastrophic events including, but not necessarily limited to, epidemics, pandemics, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, acts of terrorism and damage incidental to such events; and failure of internal controls or corporate governance policies and procedures.

LLC, as representatives of the underwriters named therein (together, the "Underwriters"), related to the offering, issuance and sale of $700,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Notes"). The Underwriting Agreement contains customary terms, conditions, representations and warranties and indemnification provisions.
The offering is being made pursuant to the Company's shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-181089), prospectus dated May 1, 2012, and related prospectus supplement dated June 3, 2013 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, including securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Company, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. The Trustee is an affiliate of BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, one of the underwriters in this offering. An affiliate of Mizuho Securities USA Inc. is the administrative agent under an unsecured revolving credit facility agreement the Company entered into in March 2013.

In connection with the offering, issuance and sale of the Notes, on June 3 and June 4, 2013, the Company entered into cross-currency swaps (including with certain of the Underwriters and their affiliates) to economically convert the $700 million liability into a 69.8 billion liability and reduce the interest rate on this debt from 3.625% in dollars to 1.50% in yen. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay, redeem or repurchase one or more of the Company's (i) 28.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.47% Samurai notes due July 2014, (ii) 5.5 billion aggregate principal amount of variable interest rate Samurai notes due July 2014 (which bear interest at an annual rate of 1.32% as of March 31, 2013) and (iii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% senior notes due August 2015, in each case, in whole or in part.

provided
however
7. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the Company's counsel and accountants in connection with the registration of the Securities under the Act and all other expenses in connection with the preparation, printing, reproduction and filing of the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus and the Prospectus and amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of copies thereof to the Underwriters and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or producing any Agreement among Underwriters, this Agreement, the Indenture, the Blue Sky Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in Section 5(d) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Underwriters in connection with such qualification and in connection with the Blue Sky survey; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating the Securities; (v) the cost of preparing the Securities; (vi) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and any agent of the Trustee and the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee in connection with the Indenture and the Securities; and (vii) all other costs and

8. The obligations of the Underwriters hereunder shall be subject, in their discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other statements of the Company herein are, at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

9. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus or any "issuer information" filed or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Act, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred; , , that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein.
provided
however
(b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Prospectus, the Pricing Prospectus or the Prospectus or any such amendment or supplement thereto, or any Issuer Free Writing Prospectus, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.
 
(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.
(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus.
 
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters' obligations in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not joint.
(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act and each broker-dealer affiliate of any Underwriter; and the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.
10. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, you may in your discretion arrange for you or another party or other parties to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty six hours after such default by any Underwriter you do not arrange for the purchase of such Securities, then the Company shall be entitled to a further period of thirty six hours within which to procure another party or other parties satisfactory to you to purchase such Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, you notify the Company that you have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, or the Company notifies you that it has so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, you or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which in your opinion may thereby be made necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.
 
(b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by you and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Company shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder and, in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Underwriter agreed to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

On June 10, 2013, Aflac Incorporated (the "Company") issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Notes"). The Notes were offered by the Company in a public offering pursuant to the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-181089) (the "Registration Statement"), prospectus dated May 1, 2012, and related prospectus supplement dated June 3, 2013. The sale of the Notes was made pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement, dated June 3, 2013, by and among the Company and Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mizuho Securities USA Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters included on Schedule 1 thereto. The Company anticipates using the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay, redeem or repurchase one or more of the Company's (i) 28.7 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.47% Samurai notes due July 2014, (ii) 5.5 billion aggregate principal amount of variable interest rate Samurai notes due July 2014 (which bear interest at an annual rate of 1.32% as of March 31, 2013) and (iii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% senior notes due August 2015, in each case, in whole or in part. The balance of the net proceeds is expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including capital contributions to subsidiaries, if needed.
The Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.625% per annum and mature on June 15, 2023. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 each year, beginning on December 15, 2013. The Notes will be redeemable at the option of the Company in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal and interest on the Notes to be redeemed, discounted to the redemption date; plus in each case accrued and unpaid interest. The Notes are general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of the Company's existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness.
The Notes were issued under an indenture, dated as of May 21, 2009 (the "Base Indenture"), between the Company, as issuer, and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by an eighth supplemental indenture, dated as of June 10, 2013 (the "Eighth Supplemental Indenture" and, together with the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The Indenture provides for customary events of default, including, among other things, nonpayment, failure to comply with the other agreements in the Indenture for a period of 90 days, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency and reorganization.
The description of the Indenture set forth above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of each of the Base Indenture, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 4.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 21, 2009, and the Eighth Supplemental Indenture (including the form of Notes included therein), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Section 1.01 . There is hereby established a new series of senior notes to be issued under the Indenture, to be designated as the Company's 3.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Senior Notes").
Establishment
There are to be authenticated and delivered Senior Notes, initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $700,000,000 and no further Senior Notes shall be authenticated and delivered except as provided by Section 2.8, 2.9, 2.11, 8.5 or 12.3 of the Original Indenture and the terms of this Eighth Supplemental Indenture; provided, however, that the Company may re-open this series of Senior Notes and the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, with the same ranking, interest rate, maturity date and other terms and with the same CUSIP and ISIN numbers as the Senior Notes other than with respect to: (i) the date of issuance, (ii) the issue price and (iii) the date from which interest shall accrue and the amount of interest payable on the first Interest Payment Date following the issuance of any such additional Senior Notes (which terms shall be set forth in a Board Resolution accompanying the Order pursuant to which any such additional Senior Notes are authenticated).

The Senior Notes shall be issued in fully registered form.
The Senior Notes shall be issued in the form of one or more Global Securities (as defined below) in substantially the form set out in Exhibit A hereto.
The form of the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication for the Senior Notes shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto.

The unpaid and outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes, and any overdue installment of interest thereon to the extent permitted by law, shall bear interest at the rate of 3.625% per year until paid or made available for payment, such interest to accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date on which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no interest has been paid, from June 10, 2013. Interest shall be paid semi-annually in arrears on each Interest Payment Date, commencing on December 15, 2013, to the Person in whose name the Senior Notes are registered on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date, provided that interest payable at the Stated Maturity or on a Redemption Date (as defined below) as provided herein, will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable.

Payment of Principal and Interest
Payments of interest on the Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for the Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay), except that, if such next succeeding Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the payment was originally payable.
Payment of the principal, premium, if any, and interest due at the Stated Maturity of, or on a Redemption Date for, the Senior Notes shall be made upon surrender of the Senior Notes at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. The principal of and interest on the Senior Notes shall be paid in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest (including interest on any Interest Payment Date) will be made, subject to such surrender where applicable, at the option of the Company, (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the
 
Security register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least 15 days prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto.

A Global Security shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in the names of Persons other than the Depositary or its nominee only as provided by Section 2.8(5) of the Original Indenture. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.

Transfer
Section 1.07 . The provisions of Sections 10.4 and 10.5 of the Original Indenture will apply to the Senior Notes.
Defeasance

LLC and their successors, appointed by the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.

"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mizuho Securities USA Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and their respective successors and two other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that if any of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mizuho

"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.

All of the provisions contained in the Original Indenture in respect of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and duties of the Trustee shall be applicable in respect of the Senior Notes and of this Eighth Supplemental Indenture as fully and with like effect as if set forth herein in full.

The Securities represented by this Note are one of the series designated on the face hereof as 3.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the "Senior Notes"), initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $700,000,000; provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes may be increased in the future, without the consent of the holders of the Senior Notes, as provided in the Eighth Supplemental Indenture. Capitalized terms used herein for which no definition is provided herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Indenture.
This Note is exchangeable in whole or from time to time in part for Senior Notes of this series in definitive registered form only as provided in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the holders of the Senior Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Senior Notes at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the holders of all Senior Notes, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders of this Note and of any Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of (i) the entire indebtedness of the Company pursuant to this Note and (ii) restrictive covenants and the related Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein, which provisions apply to this Note.
 
The Senior Notes will be redeemable, at the sole option of the Company, in whole at any time or in part from time to time (a "Redemption Date"), at a redemption price (the "Redemption Price") equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the Senior Notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such Redemption Date, discounted to such Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 20 basis points, plus, in the case of each of (i) and (ii), accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such Redemption Date.
"Treasury Rate" means (i) the yield, under the heading which represents the average for the immediately preceding week, appearing in the most recently published statistical release designated "H.15(519)" or any successor publication which is published weekly by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and which establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the maturity corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue (if no maturity is within three months before or after the remaining life, yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Comparable Treasury Issue will be determined and the Treasury Rate will be interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight line basis, rounding to the nearest month), or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain such yields, the rate per year equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption Date. The Treasury Rate shall be calculated on the third Business Day preceding the Redemption Date.
"Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security selected by the Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the Senior Notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the Senior Notes.
"Independent Investment Banker" means one of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mizuho Securities USA Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and their successors, appointed by the Company or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to select the Comparable Treasury Issue, an independent investment banking institution of national standing appointed by the Company.
"Comparable Treasury Price" means with respect to any Redemption Date for the Senior Notes (1) the average of five Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after excluding the highest and lowest of such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (2) if the Company obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations.
 
"Reference Treasury Dealer" means each of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mizuho Securities USA Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and their respective successors and two other primary U.S. government securities dealers (each a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), as specified by the Company; provided that if any of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Mizuho Securities USA Inc. or Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC or their respective successors or any Primary Treasury Dealer as specified by the Company shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Company will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer.
"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations" means, with respect to the Reference Treasury Dealer and any Redemption Date, the average, as determined by the Independent Investment Banker, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed, in each case, as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Independent Investment Banker by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption Date.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but no more than 60 days before the Redemption Date to each Holder of the Senior Notes to be redeemed. Notwithstanding Section 12.2 of the Original Indenture, the notice of redemption with respect to the foregoing redemption need not set forth the Redemption Price but only the manner of calculation thereof.
The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Redemption Price with respect to the foregoing redemption promptly after the calculation thereof. The Trustee shall not be responsible for calculating said Redemption Price. Unless the Company defaults in payment of the Redemption Price, on and after the Redemption Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Senior Notes or portions thereof called for redemption.
If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall determine, in accordance with the procedures of DTC, the principal amount of such Senior Notes to be redeemed. The Trustee may select Senior Notes and portions of Senior Notes in amounts of $2,000 and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess of $2,000.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Note is registrable in the Security register, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company for such purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security registrar and duly executed by, the holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Senior Notes, of authorized denominations and of like
 
tenor and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees. No service charge shall be made for any such exchange or registration of transfer, but the Company will require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.
Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee, any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or any premium or interest on any Senior Note on behalf of the Company ("Paying Agent") and the Security registrar may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security registrar, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying Agent nor the Security registrar shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
The Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same upon surrender of the Senior Note or Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.
No recourse shall be had for payment of the principal of or interest on this Note, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any incorporator, as such or against any past, present or future shareholder, officer or director, as such, of the Company or of any successor, either directly or through the Company or any successor, under any rule, law statute or constitutional provision, or by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such liability being expressly waived and released, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof.
Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the Trustee by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
