ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS. On May 17, 2002, a federal court jury ruled that Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Advanced Energy"), had infringed U.S. patent No. 6,150,628 held by MKS Instruments, Inc. ("MKS"), by manufacturing and selling its RAPID product, and awarded MKS damages of $4.2 million. The jury also affirmed the validity of the MKS patent, which is related to devices that dissociate gases for use in semiconductor processing applications. Advanced Energy's RAPID product represents less than five percent of its consolidated sales since the product's introduction in late 2000 and approximately three percent of its consolidated sales for the quarter ended March 31, 2002. On May 21, 2002, Advanced Energy issued a press release announcing that it will file a motion to overturn the jury verdict. The text of the press release is filed with this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 7.

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACTS: MIKE EL-HILLOW CATHY KAWAKAMI SENIOR VP, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER DIRECTOR OF INVESTOR RELATIONS ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. 970-407-6570 970-407-6732 mike.el-hillow@aei.com cathy.kawakami@aei.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ADVANCED ENERGY SEEKS TO OVERTURN JURY VERDICT FORT COLLINS, Colo., May 21, 2002 -- Advanced Energy Industries, Inc (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced that it will file a motion to overturn a May 17th jury verdict. The jury ruled in a Delaware court that AE infringed on a patent held by the Applied Science and Technology (ASTeX) division of MKS Instruments, Inc., and awarded $4.2 million in damages. The products involved are reactive gas generators used in the manufacturing of semiconductors and flat panel displays. This business division represented less than five percent of Advanced Energy's consolidated sales since its introduction in late 2000 and approximately three percent of consolidated sales in the quarter ended March 31, 2002. "We are disappointed by the court's ruling in this case, as we believe the weight of evidence was in our favor on both technical and legal grounds," said Doug Schatz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy. "In a pre-trial ruling interpreting the patent claims, the Judge considerably narrowed the breadth of the patent, and we have the technology and capability necessary to create a new design that will allow us to continue selling products into this marketplace." "This ruling impacts a very small part of our business currently. We are an acknowledged leader in new product technology and innovation, and we will continue to introduce new products that are not affected by this patent to maintain our leadership and continue to benefit from this growing market segment." ABOUT ADVANCED ENERGY Advanced Energy is a global leader in the development, marketing and support of components and sub-systems critical to plasma-based manufacturing processes used in the production of semiconductors, flat panel displays, data storage products, compact discs, digital video discs, architectural glass, and other applications that require precise thin-film processes.

Item 4. CHANGES TO REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.
     On July 15, 2002, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. ("Advanced Energy") dismissed Arthur Andersen LLP ("Andersen"), as its independent accountant, and appointed KPMG LLP ("KPMG LLP") as its new independent accountant for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002, replacing Andersen. The decision to dismiss Andersen and retain KPMG was approved by Advanced Energy's Board of Directors upon the recommendation of its Audit Committee.
     Andersen's report on Advanced Energy's 2001 financial statements was dated February 28, 2002, in conjunction with the preparation of Advanced Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on March 25, 2002.
     The audit reports of Andersen on the consolidated financial statements of Advanced Energy and its wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During Advanced Energy's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2001, and the subsequent interim period through the date of this Report, there were no disagreements between Advanced Energy and Andersen on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to Andersen's satisfaction, would have caused Andersen to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports.
     None of the reportable events described under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K occurred within Advanced Energy's two most recent fiscal years and the subsequent interim period through the date of this Report.
     Advanced Energy provided Andersen with a copy of the foregoing disclosures. Andersen has informed Advanced Energy that due to its current difficulties, it will be unable to respond to Advanced Energy's filing stating its agreement or disagreement with such statements.
     During Advanced Energy's two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2001, and the subsequent interim period through the date of this Report, Advanced Energy did not consult with KPMG regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.

Exhibit 99.1 CONTACT: MIKE EL-HILLOW EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. 970-407-6570 MIKE.EL-HILLOW@AEI.COM FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ADVANCED ENERGY REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2003 RESULTS FORT COLLINS, COLORADO (APRIL 17, 2003)-Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003. Advanced Energy offers a comprehensive suite of process-centered solutions critical to the production of semiconductors, flat panel displays, data storage products, architectural glass, laser, medical and other advanced product applications. For the 2003 first quarter, revenues were $56.2 million, up 31 percent from $42.9 million for the first quarter of 2002 and down 2 percent from $57.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Net loss for the first quarter of 2003 was $8.6 million or $0.27 per share, compared to a net loss of $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2002, or $0.27 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2002 net loss of $22.0 million, or $0.68 per share. Both the first quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2002 had charges associated with the operational changes that the Company has implemented in response to reduced market demands. In the first quarter of 2003, these charges, net of tax, totaled $1.1 million or $0.04 per share, principally attributed to restructuring charges, and $14.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 or $0.44 per share. Excluding these charges, the 2003 first quarter net loss would have been $7.5 million or $0.23 per share and the fourth quarter 2002 net loss would have been $7.8 million or $0.24 per share. Doug Schatz, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "As we expected, the first quarter of 2003 presented continued sluggish demand in our end markets, especially the semiconductor capital equipment
sector. Our order pattern has remained essentially linear since late in 2002 and there are no indications that this will change in the near term. While the industry has remained suppressed, we continue to find ways to increase our addressable markets. We have done this by continuing our focus on the development of products and technologies that leverage the application value of the plasma for our customers. By focusing our research and development on our core product groups, we believe we can realize more high-value revenue possibilities, continue to develop the most reliable products at the lowest possible cost and have the quickest time from concept to commercialization." "Based on information we have today, we anticipate second quarter revenue in the $56 to $60 million range and a loss per share range of $0.18 to $0.21 that reflects continued improvements from our operational changes", said Mr. Schatz.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the first quarter 2003. I am Mike El-Hillow, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Doug Schatz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and I will be today's speakers and we will provide an overview of the results. Dennis Faerber, our Chief Operating Officer, Doug and I will then take your questions. By now you should have received your copy of the press release that we issued approximately one hour ago.

Before we get started this morning, I would like to remind everyone that except for any historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this conference call contain certain forward-looking statements subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the volatility and cyclicality of the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries, fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results, Advanced Energy's ongoing ability to develop new products in a highly competitive industry, characterized
by increasingly rapid technological changes, our ability to successfully integrate the company's operations, and other risks described in our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and statements as filed with the SEC. In addition, we assume no obligation to update the information that we provide during this conference call. With that, I'd like to introduce Doug Schatz. DOUG. SCHATZ: Thank you Mike, and thanks for joining us this morning. As we expected, the first quarter of 2003 presented continued sluggish demand in our end markets, especially the semiconductor capital equipment sector. Sales for the quarter were approximately $56.2 million, at the upper end of our guidance of $54 million to $57 million and down 2% from the fourth quarter of 2002. Our order pattern has remained essentially linear since late in 2002 and there are no indications that this will change in the near term. While the industry has remained suppressed, we continue to find ways to increase our addressable markets. We have done this by reinforcing our focus on the development of products and technologies that leverage the application value of the plasma for our customers. By focusing our research and development on our core product groups, we believe we can realize more high-value revenue possibilities, continue to develop the most reliable products at the lowest possible cost and have the quickest time from concept to commercialization. These core product groups include power, flow, thermal, plasma and ion sources that enable our customers to improve their plasma manufacturing processes. We are specifically focused on the plasma process itself because the largest point of value creation is where the plasma and the wafer meet. We constantly identify and leverage our process-based knowledge into existing and new applications, each of which offers us growth potential. For semiconductors, the move to 300mm, and smaller line widths, demands more precisely customized power, temperature 2
and gas management. This is resulting in an increasing demand from our customers to adapt and create products that can help them take advantage of their emerging needs. In the flat-panel market, size, resolution and lower manufacturing costs will continue to drive increasing volume. Entertainment data storage is growing with DVD and demands more density and capacity. Beyond the high volume markets, deposition and surface modification of glass, metals, fabric, optics and polymers represent an increasingly important part of our addressable markets. Our Dressler product group has given us important penetration in the laser and medical markets. And finally, our IKORTM product group continues to expand its market presence in high-end server applications. From an organizational standpoint, we improved our executive management team during the quarter with the addition of Dennis Faerber as Chief Operating Officer and Craig Jeffries as Chief Marketing Officer. Dennis and Craig have powerful experience in the electronics industry. Most of their experience was gained at Hewlett-Packard, Agilent and Honeywell/Allied Signal. They will be key contributors both strategically and operationally. Over the last six months, we have also driven to a simplified operating structure. We now have two major product groups: Power Systems, and Control Systems and Instrumentation, as well as two emerging product groups: IKORTM and Dressler. This more streamlined organization helps us be much more efficient, and faster in new product development, as we are now able to better leverage critical mass resources and drive to a much lower breakeven and variable operating model. Our move to China is on schedule. We are using China for our final assembly and test, and to get more efficient local access to Tier 1 suppliers. The factory was opened and occupied by our start-up team on April 2. Our first qualification units for Power products are planned for mid-May. 3
While we have stayed on schedule to date, the war and the SARS outbreak can impact our progress with these overseas initiatives. The war has caused tightened controls on issuance of training visas and SARS has resulted in restricted international travel. Fortunately, we have already hired and trained our key managers and supervisors. With careful travel provisions and advanced interactive video training we feel we have a good shot to stay on or close to schedule. I am continuously impressed with the adaptability and creativity that our team has shown during this period. While it certainly isn't an optimal situation, we are making good progress. We do have contingency plans if things get significantly worse and even then we believe we would only see moderate delays and minimal impact to our financial plan. Our outsourcing to Tier 1 suppliers has progressed favorably and quickly, with several key suppliers already qualified and ready for production. We are planning for measurable savings from this effort beginning in Q2 and increasing throughout the remainder of the year as we continue to qualify more parts among a dozen validated suppliers. The global problems that could affect our final assembly and test facility in China should have very little impact on our sourcing changes. Our plans to drive to a much lower breakeven and more variable operating model have also progressed well. We continue to implement these plans, and by the end of 2003 will have a quarterly operating cash flow breakeven of $55 to $60 million in sales. In addition to China and Tier 1 outsourcing, other major initiatives are: o Exiting our PCBA manufacturing facility by June 30 and outsourcing all of our high volume PCBAs to China. o Rationalizing our worldwide sales, marketing and service functions during the second quarter, and reducing our related headcount by 20%. The major reductions are taking place internationally. 4
o Selling our industrial flow manufacturing facility and moving the related manufacturing to China and the development to Fort Collins. As part of our overall drive toward operational excellence we have implemented advanced supply chain management concepts to reduce inventories. The key element is the use of a third-party-logistics provider, or 3PL, to dramatically reduce factory replenishment lead-time. We have partnered with a global, world-class supplier of such services, who can also link our US operation with our emerging Asian supply chain and new China factory. The result of this effort will ultimately be lower inventory, better response by our vendors and lower logistics costs overall. Our Fort Collins location went live on 3PL at the end of March and is currently migrating all supplier deliveries and internal inventories to the new hub. We are doing a lot, but a lot must be done in this industry transforming environment. The markets we serve are demanding new and better ways to meet their needs. Historically, AE has successfully met this challenge to evolve. Our management team has the leadership and experience needed to execute these plans as we reshape our business model and best position the company for the opportunities ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mike El-Hillow so that he can review the financial results with you. MIKE EL-HILLOW: Thanks, Doug. I will review the results of the first quarter of 2003 and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2003. For the 2003 first quarter, revenues were $56.2 million - up 31% from $42.9 million for the first quarter of 2002 and down 2% from $57.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Gross margin was 32.0% of sales for the first quarter compared with 31.2% for the year ago period and 32.5%, adjusted for inventory write-offs, for the fourth quarter of 2002. Margins were down a bit quarter over quarter because of the lower sales volume and 5
costs associated with our China facility. As the year progresses, we will begin to see the impact of our move to Tier 1 suppliers and the overall lower cost of our China facility. The net loss for the first quarter of 2003 was $8.6 million or $0.27 per share, essentially the same as the $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2002. This compares to fourth quarter 2002 net loss of $22.0 million, or $0.68 per share. Both the first quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2002 had certain charges associated with the operational changes that we have discussed. In this quarter, they totaled $1.1 million, net of tax, principally restructuring charges. Excluding these charges, the first quarter loss would have been $7.5 million or $0.23 per share and the fourth quarter 2002 net loss would have been $7.8 million or $0.24 per share. If we look at the first quarter sales by end market, semiconductor capital equipment represented 59% of total sales or $33.1 million. This is a quarter-over-quarter decrease of 3% in dollar terms. In the first quarter of 2002, sales from semiconductor capital equipment customers represented 71% of total sales or $30.4 million. Applied Materials, our largest semiconductor capital equipment customer, represented 23% of total first quarter sales, or $13.1 million, up from 22% in the fourth quarter of 2002, or $12.6 million. In dollar terms, sales to Applied grew 4%. In the first quarter of 2002, Applied represented 24% of total sales. Flat-panel display applications represented 12% of total first quarter revenue, or $6.7 million which represents a decline of 26% in dollar terms compared to the fourth quarter of 2002 amount of $9.1 million. This market represented 5% of total first quarter 2002 sales, or $2.3 million. The quarter-to-quarter change was due to customers absorbing the significant amount of equipment bought in the second half of 2002. However, year over year this market has seen almost a tripling of growth for us and we believe will sustain its strength over the near term. 6
The data storage industry, which is comprised of digital video disc, compact disc and computer data storage markets, was 7% of total first quarter sales or $3.9 million, which represents a 128% increase in dollar terms compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. This market represented 6%, or $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2002. Both entertainment and computer data storage saw significant sequential and year over year increases. Advanced product applications represented 22% of first quarter revenue, or $12.5 million, which represents a decrease of 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. Sales to this market were 18% of total sales, or $7.8 million in the first quarter of 2002. This category includes a variety of applications such as our IKORTM power supply for the high end computing market, industrial coatings, architectural glass coatings and laser and medical applications. Global support was $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2003, essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2002. Global support represented $4.1 million of total sales in the first quarter of 2002. Looking at sales by geographic region, domestic sales represented 52% of total sales compared to 53% in the prior quarter and 62% in the first quarter of 2002. Europe increased to 17% of sales compared to 14% in the prior quarter and 13% a year ago. Asia Pacific represented 31% of sales, compared to 33% in the prior quarter and 24% a year ago. We ended the first quarter of 2003 with a total backlog of $25 million, which represents a 14.6% increase compared to fourth quarter 2002 backlog of $21.8 million. R&D spending was $13.4 million or 24% of sales during the first quarter. This compares to $13.0 million or 23% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2002, and $11.2 million or 26% of sales in the first quarter of 2002. As we complete some important projects, we expect that our quarterly R&D spend will be approximately $12.5 million. Also, included in this 7
quarter's spend is a licensing agreement that will help us to further expand our plasma-based technology, essentially accounting for the sequential increase. S, G & A was $14.0 million in the first quarter of 2003 or 24.9% of sales, compared to $15.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2002, adjusted for certain items, or 27.4% of sales and $13.5 million, or 31.6% of sales in the first quarter of 2002. The $1.8 million sequential decrease was due to our on-going cost reduction measures and will continue to decrease throughout 2003. Headcount at the end of the first quarter was 1,394 people of which there were 1,310 full-time and 84 temporary employees. That compares with a headcount of 1,398 people at the end of fourth quarter of 2002. As we discussed in February, we did not expect to have any significant headcount changes until the second quarter of 2003. The first quarter also includes our initial hiring in China. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $160.8 million. Our cash position decreased in the first quarter of 2003 by $11.5 million, primarily due to our operating loss net of non-cash expenses and the repayment of $2.3 million of notes payable and capital lease obligations. Our trade accounts receivable decreased to $37.2 million, compared to $40.8 million in the prior quarter. DSOs decreased to 62 days compared to 65 days in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 69 days in the first quarter of 2002. First quarter inventory was $56.0 million, compared to $57.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. Inventory turns were 2.7 turns in the 2003 first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2002 and 2.0 turns in the first quarter of 2002. Total days inventory was 137 days, essentially the same in the fourth quarter of 2002 and a decrease from 184 days in the first quarter of 2002. 8
Our capital expenditures in the first quarter were $3.4 million, similar to the fourth quarter of 2002 and higher than the $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2002. The higher spend was due to investments in China. Depreciation was $3.2 million in the first quarter, compared to $2.9 million one year ago. We expect cap ex to be approximately $10 to $12 million in 2003. Although our visibility remains poor long term, current customer order patterns indicate that revenue in the second quarter will be in the $56 to $60 million range with a loss per share in the range of $0.18 to $0.21. Gross margin will continue to improve and should be approximately 32% to 33.5%. As we stated previously, R&D will be approximately $12.5 million and S, G & A will be approximately $13.5 to $14 million. For the quarter, we expect our cash burn to be in the $6 to $8 million range. Also, in the second and third quarters, we will take additional charges totaling $1.5 million to $3.5 million as we complete our operational changes. Including the $1.5 million in the first quarter, the total for 2003 is in line with the guidance we gave in February of $3 to $5 million. Doug, Dennis and I will now be happy to answer any questions, so, operator, please open for questions. Thank you. 9

     On May 14, 2003 MKS Instruments, Inc. filed a patent infringement suit against Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del. MKS alleges that Advanced Energy's latest reactive gas generator Xstream infringes on MKS' U.S. patent 6,150,628 and four additional patents granted to MKS.
     On May 15, 2003 Advanced Energy issued a press release in response to the MKS patent infringement suit and announcing that it had previously filed an action in a Federal Court in Denver for a declaratory ruling of non-infringement in order to permit Advanced Energy to market its Xstream technology.

EXHIBIT 99.1 CONTACT: MIKE EL-HILLOW EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. 970-407-6570 MIKE.EL-HILLOW@AEI.COM FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ADVANCED ENERGY RESPONDS TO MKS INSTRUMENTS LAWSUIT FORT COLLINS, COLORADO (MAY 15, 2003)-Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced that, contrary to allegations in a complaint filed on May 14, 2003 by MKS Instruments, Inc., Advanced Energy is confident that Xstream(TM), its new reactive gas generator product, is not in violation of any MKS patent. In May 2002, a Delaware court clearly defined the limits of the MKS technology and its 6,150,628 patent. Advanced Energy respects those limits, and designed its new product to avoid infringement of any MKS patent based upon the advice of a team of independent experts. The four additional patents that have issued to MKS since the time of the Delaware litigation are continuations of the 6,150,628 patent based upon the same technology. Advanced Energy filed an action last month in a Federal Court in Denver for a declaratory ruling of non-infringement in order to permit Advanced Energy to market its Xstream technology, which is the subject of Advanced Energy's own patents and pending applications.

Revenue for the second quarter of 2003 increased 12 percent compared to first quarter 2003 revenue of $56.2 million. Net loss for the second quarter of 2003 was $5.8 million, or $0.18 per share compared to the second quarter 2002 net loss of $5.1 million, or $0.16 per share.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
  Advanced Energy (Nasdaq: AEIS) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003.
Fort Collins, Colorado (October 16, 2003)
Revenue for the third quarter of 2003 decreased 3 percent to $68.6 million, compared to third quarter 2002 revenue of $70.7 million. Revenue for the third quarter of 2003 increased 9 percent compared to second quarter 2003 revenue of $62.9 million.
Net loss for the third quarter of 2003 was $27.4 million or $0.85 per share including pre-tax charges of $2.2 million related to restructuring charges and an intangible asset impairment, and a non-cash charge of $22.4 million related to the Company's net deferred tax asset. The third quarter 2003 net loss compares to the third quarter 2002 net loss of $5.6 million or $0.17 per share, and the second quarter 2003 net loss of $5.8 million or $0.18 per share.
Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 were $187.7 million compared to $181.5 million for the first nine months of 2002. Net loss for the 2003 nine-month period was $41.8 million, or $1.30 per share, compared to a net loss of $19.4 million, or $0.61 per share for the 2002 nine-month period.
Doug Schatz, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said, "The third quarter results met our expectations for moderate sequential improvement based on improving order trends and share gains in several end markets. Sales to the flat panel display, data storage and architectural glass markets all posted double-digit growth
 
sequentially. Our technology lead is being validated across our end markets through continued design wins and share gains in both our power and flow product lines.
"We are continuing to see modestly improving industry conditions. However, based on the fact that the fourth quarter will include industry-wide shutdowns, including three weeks at AE, we anticipate a fourth quarter sales level similar to that of the third quarter," said Mr. Schatz.
Based on information currently available, the Company expects fourth quarter revenues to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2003, and a loss per share range of $0.14 to $0.16, which assumes no tax benefit from the loss.
Management will host a conference call today, Thursday, October 16, 2003 at 5:00 pm Eastern time to discuss the financial results. You may access this conference call by dialing 888-713-4717.

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Full Year Review
For the full year 2003, revenue was $262.4 million, compared with $238.9 million for the full year 2002, a 10 percent increase. Net loss for the full year 2003 was $44.2 million, or $1.37 per share, compared with a net loss of $41.4 million, or $1.29 per share, for the full year 2002.
Doug Schatz, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Industry fundamentals are improving, and we are experiencing strong demand in all product groups, primarily driven by our semiconductor and flat panel customers. Our sales to semiconductor original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the fourth quarter of 2003 increased 22 percent compared to the 2003 third quarter, and sales to flat panel display OEMs increased 38 percent from the prior quarter. Our ability to secure key designs in high-growth semiconductor segments such as 300mm etch and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) puts us in a strong position to benefit as the industry accelerates its transition to larger wafers, as well as to smaller line widths and advanced materials such as copper and low-k dielectrics.
"In this accelerating order environment, we continue to focus on improving internal efficiencies and cost control. The initial improvements have shown through in our fourth quarter performance, and we posted income from operations for the first time in ten quarters. Looking ahead, we expect to gain greater leverage from the changes we have made, such as our manufacturing operation in China and our transition to a world-class Asian supply base.
"Based on our strong market position and the continued order momentum, we anticipate first quarter revenue in the $95 to $100 million range and earnings per share in the range of $0.12 to $0.17," said Mr. Schatz.
Fourth Quarter and Year-End Conference Call
Management will host a conference call today, Thursday, February 12, 2004 at 5:00 pm Eastern time to discuss the financial results.

Net income for the first quarter of 2004 includes approximately $1.0 million in pretax gains resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities and the sale of the Company's thermal control business. Doug Schatz, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We experienced strong demand in all product groups, driven by continued momentum in the semiconductor capital equipment market and the market leading positions we have secured in high-growth semiconductor processing applications. This sales growth, coupled with the progress we've made to streamline our operating infrastructure, enabled us to achieve significant profitability in the first quarter. Our commitment to continued product innovation drives our ability to capture new opportunities and expand our market reach over a wide range of plasma-based processing applications. "Our decision to move out of the thermal control business is part of our continued focus on core competencies. The wafer chiller line is based on highly differentiated technology, and we are not willing to devote the resources required to meaningfully promote and support these products given our target long-term operating model for sustainable profitability throughout industry cycles. -more-
Advanced Energy Reports First Quarter 2004 Results - Page 2 April 15, 2004 "Towards the end of the first quarter, we were seeing indications that order patterns are leveling out as the market absorbs the recent surge in capital equipment purchases. We anticipate second quarter revenue in the $107 million to $115 million range and an earnings per share range of $0.20 to $0.25. We continue to make progress in our transition to a more variable operating model, targeting sustainable, ongoing improvements to our incremental operating margin," said Mr. Schatz.

On July 21, 2004 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the "Company") announced via press release the Company's results for its three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2004. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, is furnished pursuant to Item 12 and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section. Furthermore, the information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including the exhibit, shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the filings of the Company under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

     Date: July 21, 2004
 

. . . FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ADVANCED ENERGY REPORTS SECOND QUARTER 2004 RESULTS FORT COLLINS, COLO., JULY 21, 2004 -- Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004. Advanced Energy offers a comprehensive suite of process-centered solutions critical to the production of semiconductors, flat panel displays, data storage products, architectural glass and other advanced product applications. For the 2004 second quarter, revenues were $108.9 million, up 73 percent from $62.9 million for the second quarter of 2003, and up 4 percent compared to revenues of $104.5 million for the first quarter of 2004. Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was $4.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $5.8 million, or $0.18 per share in the second quarter of 2003. This compares to first quarter 2004 net income of $6.9 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which includes $1.0 million in pretax gains resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities and the sale of the Company's thermal control business. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was $213.4 million versus $119.1 million for the first six months of 2003. Net income for the 2004 six-month period was $11.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to a net loss for the 2003 six-month period of $14.4 million, or $0.45 per share. Doug Schatz, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "As we had anticipated, semiconductor order momentum leveled quarter-to-quarter, as end users entered an absorption phase following several months of robust 200mm-driven equipment shipments. While we had a modest increase in sales, we are disappointed by our operating results. The continuation of higher than expected China-related and Asian-based supplier transition costs, and product mix negatively impacted gross margin. The decision to manufacture high volume products in China is the right strategic move long term. However, the continuation of dual manufacturing with our US-based facility on certain product lines is negatively impacting gross margin to a greater degree than we planned. We are committed to reducing these transition costs and expect gross margin improvement by the end of 2004.
Advanced Energy Reports Second Quarter 2004 Results -- Page 2 July 21, 2004 "Looking ahead, we continue to experience the effect of semiconductor manufacturers' cautious capital equipment purchasing patterns, despite some positive longer-term indicators. We anticipate third quarter revenue to be down 2 to 5 percent relative to the second quarter, with earnings per share in the range of $0.08 to $0.12." "Advanced Energy is well-positioned with innovative products that drive advanced technology in all of our target markets. We continue to increase our market share, particularly through key design wins on 300mm tools in high-growth semiconductor applications and new generation flat panel display equipment. Our focus on innovation enables technological and market leadership, and we continue to extend that lead as our customers adopt increasingly complex manufacturing processes, requiring increased precision and control," said Mr. Schatz. SECOND QUARTER CONFERENCE CALL Management will host a conference call today, Wednesday, July 21, 2004 at 5:00 pm Eastern time to discuss Advanced Energy's financial results.

Item 4. CHANGES TO REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.
     On August 16, 2004 (the "Change Date"), the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. ("Advanced Energy") dismissed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as Advanced Energy's independent accountants. On August 17, 2004, the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy appointed Grant Thornton LLP ("Grant Thornton") as independent accountants to audit Advanced Energy's financial statements for fiscal periods subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Pursuant to the charter of the Audit and Finance Committee, such committee has the sole authority to hire and terminate Advanced Energy's independent auditors.
     The audit reports of KPMG on the consolidated financial statements of Advanced Energy and subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except as follows: KPMG's audit report covering the two fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 contained the following paragraphs:
     "As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries adopted the provisions of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, , and No. 142 , effective January 1, 2002."

Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64
Amendment of FASB Statement 13, and Technical Corrections
     "As discussed above, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and comprehensive loss, and cash flows of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2001 were audited by other auditors who have ceased operations. As described in Note 1, the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001 have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, , which was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 in Note 1 are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole."

Advanced Energy Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results  Page 1 October 21, 2004
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2004. Advanced Energy offers a comprehensive suite of process-centered solutions critical to the production of semiconductors, flat panel displays, data storage products, architectural glass and other advanced product applications.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., October 21, 2004
For the 2004 third quarter, revenues were $93.6 million, up 36 percent compared to $68.6 million for the third quarter of 2003, and down 14 percent compared to revenues of $108.9 million for the second quarter of 2004. The third quarter 2004 net loss of $1.1 million, or $0.03 per share, compares to the third quarter 2003 net loss of $27.4 million, or $0.85 per share. Net income for the second quarter of 2004 was $4.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 was $306.9 million versus $187.7 million for the first nine months of 2003. Net income for the 2004 nine-month period was $10.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to a net loss for the 2003 nine-month period of $41.8 million, or $1.30 per share.
Doug Schatz, chairman and chief executive officer, said, "Our third quarter results reflect the downward trend in semiconductor capital equipment and data storage spending that we discussed on our second quarter 2004 conference call. We expect this weakness to continue in the near term, but depending on the shape of the industry cycle, there could be growth drivers for increased capital investment during 2005. However, this is primarily dependent on macroeconomic factors that are difficult to estimate and predict.
"We are focused on what we can control, specifically, driving continued technology leadership and improved efficiencies throughout the organization. Today, we announced a realignment of our manufacturing organization that will reduce our Fort Collins workforce by approximately 200 employees over the next nine months. Once the transition is complete, the Fort Collins facility will focus on new product design and launch programs, low volume manufacturing and advanced manufacturing processes," continued Mr. Schatz.
 
Advanced Energy Reports Third Quarter 2004 Results  Page 2 October 21, 2004
"This is a difficult decision that affects many of our local employees. However, it is a necessary step in our worldwide manufacturing realignment designed to enhance our ability to deliver higher quality products with shorter lead times at lower cost. We continue to provide value and innovation to our customers, while taking necessary steps to align our company with the industry environment both near and long term," continued Mr. Schatz.
For the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company expects the business environment to continue to decline based on the cautious spending outlook from major semiconductor end users and OEMs. The Company anticipates fourth quarter revenue to be $82.5 million to $85.0 million, or down approximately 9 to 12 percent relative to the third quarter, and a loss per share range of $0.15 to $0.20.

("the Company") approved a new Executive Compensation Plan ("the Plan") effective beginning in 2005, based on the recommendation of its independent executive compensation consultant. The Plan will provide key employees, including the executive officers and key functional and geographic leaders, the opportunity to earn annual cash bonuses based on corporate and individual performance targets established at the beginning of each year. No bonus will be paid for performance below a minimum level.
Participants will be eligible to receive a target bonus, up to an annual maximum, calculated as a percentage of base salary, based on achievement or over-achievement of individual performance targets to be set by the Compensation Committee, as follows:
Pursuant to the Plan, base salaries of the participants generally will be set at approximately the 50 percentile of each executive's peers, as determined by the independent executive compensation consultant, subject to adjustment based on experience levels and then current market conditions.
th
Other employees designated as participants will be eligible for awards at the discretion of executive management.
The Plan also provides for equity-based compensation to the participants, which will consist of stock options and restricted stock units, to be allocated by the Compensation Committee annually.
Lead Director Retainer and Meeting Fees
     On December 30, 2004, the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. approved the grant of an annual retainer of $25,000 to Elwood Spedden, in his capacity as Lead Director. This retainer is in addition to the $15,000 annual retainer paid to all non-employee directors and is payable in four equal installments in February, April, July and October of each year.
 
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
     On December 30, 2004, the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. adopted an annual operating plan that includes the termination on or before June 30, 2005 of approximately 280 employees, including approximately 120 agency employees, in its Fort Collins, Colorado and Hachioji, Japan facilities. The need to reduce headcount in Fort Collins and Hachioji results primarily from the transfer of a substantial portion of the Company's manufacturing operations to Shenzhen, China. Anticipated new hires in Shenzhen, particularly for manufacturing operations, will partially offset the reductions in headcount in Fort Collins and Hachioji. In connection with the reductions in headcount, the Company expects to record charges of approximately $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 and approximately $1.5 million in the first half of 2005. All of such charges relate to anticipated separation costs to be paid to the terminated employees, in cash, by the end of the second quarter of 2005.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments
     On December 30, 2004, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., following consultation with the Audit and Finance Committee and the Board of Directors, concluded that a charge of approximately $3.2 million is required under generally accepted accounting principles for the impairment in value of certain employment agreement and customer list assets relating to companies acquired in 2002. The employment agreement and customer list assets are classified as contract-based and other amortizable intangible assets, respectively, on the Company's financial statements. The charge is based on the officers' evaluation of the 2005 operating plan and consideration of the anticipated continued contributions of certain key individuals that joined the Company in connection with the acquisitions. There are no future cash expenditures relating to this charge.
Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers
     (b) On December 30, 2004, Douglas S. Schatz, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., notified the Board of Directors of his intent to retire from his executive positions. Mr. Schatz will continue as President and Chief Executive Officer until his successor is named and then will continue as non-executive Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors has appointed a search committee to find his successor.
     (d) On December 30, 2004, the Board of Directors appointed Joseph R. Bronson as a director of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., effective immediately. Mr. Bronson also was appointed to the Audit and Finance Committee. Mr. Bronson, age 56, currently is president of FormFactor, Inc., a designer and manufacturer of advanced semiconductor wafer probe cards. Mr. Bronson was appointed president of FormFactor in November 2004 and has been a director of FormFactor since April 2002. Prior to becoming president of FormFactor, Mr. Bronson held significant leadership positions with Applied Materials, Inc. Until his resignation from Applied Materials in October 2004, he had served as its Executive Vice President since December 2000 and as its Chief Financial Officer and a member of the Office of the President since January 1998. Mr. Bronson is also a director of Jacobs Engineering Group, a diversified technical professional consulting firm, as well as FormFactor.
 
     Consistent with the compensation payable to all other non-employee directors of the Company, Mr. Bronson will be paid an annual retainer of $15,000, payable in four equal installments in February, April, July and October of each year, as well as meeting fees of $3,000 for each full board meeting that he attends in person, $1,500 for each telephonic board meeting at which a vote is taken and $1,500 for each Audit and Finance Committee meeting that he attends. Mr. Bronson will also participate in the Company's 2003 Non Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Vesting
          (ii) . At the time Shares are issued to the Participant pursuant to Restricted Stock Units, the Participant shall be required, to the extent required by applicable law, to purchase such Shares from the Company at a purchase price equal to the aggregate par value of the Shares represented by such Restricted Stock.

Payment for Shares
          (iii) . The Company shall have the right to deduct from the Shares issuable pursuant to Restricted Stock Units, or to accept from the Participant the tender of, a number of whole Shares having a fair market value, as determined by the Administrator, equal to all or any part of the federal, state, local and foreign taxes, if any, required by law to be withheld by the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units or the Shares acquired pursuant thereto. Alternatively or in addition, in its sole discretion,
Withholding Taxes
 
the Company shall have the right to require Participant, through payroll withholding, cash payment or otherwise, to make adequate provision for any such tax withholding obligations of the Company arising in connection with the Restricted Stock Units or the Shares acquired pursuant thereto.
          (iv) . Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or in writing after the Award Agreement is issued, upon the termination of the Participant's Service, any Restricted Stock Units held by such Participant that have not vested, or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed, shall immediately be deemed forfeited. Upon forfeiture of Restricted Stock Units, the Grantee shall have no further rights with respect to such award.

Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares covered by his or her Restricted Stock Units until the date of the issuance to him or her of a share certificate for the Shares, and no adjustment will be made for dividends or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date the certificate is issued. A holder of Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. Restricted Stock Units shall represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement.
Rights of a Holder
          (vii) . The Administrator shall have the power to modify, extend, or renew outstanding Restricted Stock Units or authorize the grant of new Restricted Stock Units in substitution therefor, provided that any such action may not have the effect of significantly impairing any rights or obligations of any Restricted Stock Unit previously granted without the consent of the affected Participant.
Amendment
          2. The Administrator shall have the power to interpret the provisions of the Plan that, prior to this amendment, were applicable to options granted pursuant to the Plan and/or the Shares issuable on exercise thereof, to be applicable also to Restricted Stock Units and/or the shares subject thereto.

You acknowledge that you have carefully reviewed the Plan and agree that the Plan will control in the event any provision of this Agreement should appear to be inconsistent with the terms of the Plan.
 
 
 
     
By signing the cover sheet of this Agreement, you agree to all of the terms and conditions described above and in the Plan.

 
Exhibit 10.3
     The Optionee described in the accompanying Notice of Option Grant has been awarded an option to purchase common stock of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. ("Option"), the terms of which are contained in:
     This Agreement is entered into by and between the Optionee and Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. ("AEI"), as of the Grant Date specified in the Notice.
     1. . Specified in the Notice are the Optionee, the Grant Date (which is the effective date of this Option), the number of Shares subject to this Agreement, the Exercise Price per Share and the latest Expiration Date. Other terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings given to them in the Plan.
Defined Terms
     2. . Subject to the limitations herein, this Option is exercisable in installments according to the vesting schedule set forth in the Notice. An installment shall not become exercisable on the otherwise applicable vesting date for that installment if the Optionee's Date of Termination (see Section 4 below) occurs on or before that date. This Option may be exercised on or after the Date of Termination (if at all) only as to that portion of the Shares as to which it was exercisable immediately before the Date of Termination. Further vesting of this Option shall be suspended on and after the 91 day of the Optionee's approved leave of absence (unless such suspension is prohibited by law) and will resume (without credit for the suspension period) if and when the leave of absence terminates before the Optionee's Date of Termination.
Exercisability
st
     3. . This Option shall terminate, and cease to be exercisable, on the close of business of the last business day that occurs on or before the earliest to occur of:
Termination
 
     This Option may terminate earlier than the date described above in this section in connection with a Change in Control as provided under Section 10 of the Plan.
     4. . An Optionee's "Date of Termination" is the first day after the Grant Date on which the Optionee is no longer in the Service of the Company, regardless of the reason for such termination. For purposes of this definition, the Optionee's Service shall not be considered terminated while the Optionee is on a leave of absence from the Company until the leave exceeds 90 days or such later date as the Optionee's right to employment is no longer guaranteed by statute or contract. If, as a result of a sale or other transaction, (i) the Optionee's employer ceases to be an entity within the Company and (ii) the Optionee is not, at the end of the 30-day period following the transaction, employed by the Company, then the occurrence of such transaction shall be treated as the Optionee's Date of Termination caused by the Optionee being discharged by the Company involuntarily.
Date of Termination
     5. . Subject to its terms, this Option may be exercised in whole or in part by filing a written notice with AEI's stock plan administrator at its corporate headquarters before this Option terminates. Such notice shall specify the number of Shares which the Optionee elects to purchase and will include payment of the Exercise Price for such Shares. Payment shall be by cash or personal check payable to Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. In addition to any other method approved by the Administrator, this Option may be exercised by (i) delivery (or attestation, if acceptable to the Administrator) of Shares owned by the Optionee having an aggregate Fair Market Value (valued as of the date of exercise) that is equal to the amount of cash that would otherwise be required and (ii) authorizing a third party to sell the Shares (or a sufficient portion of the Shares) acquired upon exercise of this Option and remitting to AEI a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Exercise Price and any tax withholding resulting from exercise. This Option is not exercisable if and to the extent AEI determines that exercise would violate applicable securities laws or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange on which AEI stock is traded. If AEI makes such a determination, it shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain compliance with such laws, rules and regulations. In making any determination hereunder, AEI may rely on the opinion of its counsel.
Method of Exercise
A resident of China must pay the Exercise Price through the immediate sale of Shares acquired upon Option exercise and remitting to the Company a sufficient portion of the proceeds to pay the aggregate Exercise Price and tax withholding.
Special Rule for Residents of China.
 
     6. . Performance under this Agreement is subject to withholding of all applicable taxes. Subject to such rules that the Administrator may establish from time to time, Optionee may elect to satisfy any withholding obligations by surrendering Shares that the Optionee already owns, or to which the Optionee is otherwise entitled under the Plan. If this Option is exercised while the Optionee is resident outside the United States, AEI may require settlement of all applicable tax withholding through the immediate sale of a sufficient number of Shares that would otherwise be acquired upon Option exercise.
Withholding
     7. . Except as provided in Plan Section 6(c), this Option is not transferable.
Transferability
     8. . This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, AEI and its successors and assigns, and upon any person acquiring, whether by merger, consolidation, purchase of assets or otherwise, all or substantially all of the Company's assets and business. If any rights exercisable by the Optionee under this Agreement have not been exercised at the time of the Optionee's death, such rights shall be exercisable in accordance with Section 9(e) of the Plan.
Heirs and Successors
     9. . The Administrator shall control the operation and administration of this Option, and the Administrator shall have all powers with respect to this Agreement as it has with respect to the Plan. Any interpretation of the Agreement by the Administrator and any decision made by it with respect to the Agreement is final and binding on all persons.
Administration
     10. . Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Plan, a copy of which may be obtained by the Optionee from AEI's stock plan administrator; and this Agreement is subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations promulgated by the Administrator from time to time pursuant to the Plan.
Plan Governs
     11. . This Option does not confer on the Optionee any right with respect to continuance of employment or other service with the Company, nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of such Optionee's employment or other service at any time.
Not An Employment Contract
     12. . Any written notices provided for in this Agreement or the Plan shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficiently given if either hand delivered or if sent by fax or overnight courier, or by postage paid first class mail. Notices sent by mail shall be deemed received three business days after mailing but in no event later than the date of actual receipt. Notices shall be directed, if to the Optionee, at the Optionee's address indicated by AEI's records, or if to AEI, to AEI's stock plan administrator at its principal executive office.
Notices
     13. . No exercise shall be allowed with respect to a fraction of a Share. Should only a fraction of one Share remain vested but unexercised when the last exercise under this Option is made, AEI shall pay to the Optionee an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such fractional Share.
Fractional Shares
 
     14. . The Optionee shall have no rights of a stockholder with respect to the Shares subject to this Option, until a stock certificate has been duly issued following exercise of this Option as provided herein.
No Rights As Stockholder
     15. . This Agreement may be amended by written agreement of the Optionee and the Administrator, without the consent of any other person.
Amendment
     16. . Optionee acknowledges receipt of and understands and agrees to the terms of this Option. Optionee also understands and agrees to the following:
Acknowledgements
     17. . Upon the exercise of this Option, an Optionee who is a resident of China shall authorize and direct the broker to immediately sell any and all Shares that otherwise would have been delivered, net of applicable taxes and exercise consideration due AEI. This Agreement shall serve as such Optionee's express authorization to sell immediately any and all Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Option. As soon as reasonably practical, Optionee shall be entitled to payment of the proceeds resulting from such disposition, net of the applicable tax withholding and exercise consideration due to the Company.
Immediate Sale of Shares for Residents of China
 
     By executing this Agreement, Optionee agrees to the foregoing and acknowledges having received a copy of the separate Plan and Notice, both of which contain important terms.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On February 17, 2005, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. announced via press release its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. A copy of the press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement the fourth quarter 2004 condensed consolidated financial statements prepared under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. uses "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of adjusted net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude certain charges and benefits, and adjusted gross profit that is GAAP gross profit, adjusted to exclude inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory. Reconciliations from the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures reported under GAAP are included in the press release. Due to the amount of charges incurred in the fourth quarter as a result of realignment and other activities, Advanced Energy believes that the adjusted results are useful to investors to aid in understanding the operating results of the fourth quarter. The management of Advanced Energy uses the adjusted results to analyze the fourth quarter 2004 and to plan and forecast future periods. The non-GAAP measures used are neither in accordance with, nor alternatives for, the comparable GAAP measures, and may be materially different from similar non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The presentation of this supplemental information should not be considered as a substitute for the company's net income or gross profit determined in accordance with GAAP.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Reference is made to the press release of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. issued on February 17, 2005, regarding earnings guidance, which is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. Advanced Energy provides a comprehensive suite of process-centered solutions critical to the production of semiconductors, flat panel displays, data storage products, architectural glass and other advanced thin film product applications.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., February 17, 2005
Fourth Quarter 2004 Review
For the 2004 fourth quarter, sales were $88.4 million, up 18 percent compared to $74.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, and down 6 percent compared to $93.6 million in sales for the third quarter of 2004.
The fourth quarter 2004 net loss was $23.0 million, or $0.70 per share. Included in the fourth quarter 2004 net loss are $19.8 million in pre-tax charges primarily attributable to increased excess and obsolete inventory reserves, a change in an accounting estimate related to demonstration equipment, employee severance and termination costs, and intangible asset impairments.
The fourth quarter 2003 net loss was $2.4 million, or $0.08 per share, and the third quarter 2004 net loss was $1.1 million or $0.03 per share.
Full-Year 2004 Review
Full-year 2004 sales were $395.3 million, a 51 percent increase compared to $262.4 million in sales for the full-year 2003. The net loss for the 2004 full-year period was $12.7 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to a net loss of $44.2 million, or $1.37 per share for the full-year 2003.
Doug Schatz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy, said, "Revenue for the fourth quarter was above our expectations based on strong sales to the flat panel display market. This week, we formally announced Summit, a revolutionary product targeted at advanced processing applications, including next generation flat panel display manufacturing. Summit has had a successful introduction to the marketplace, contributing to the 94 percent year-over-year increase in sales to the flat panel display market."
 
Advanced Energy Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2004 Results  Page 2 February 17, 2005
"Semiconductor-related business continues to decline in the near term, although recently announced capital expenditure budget increases by large chip manufacturers could suggest improving trends later in the year," said Mr. Schatz. "We are continuing to take the appropriate actions to ensure we are well positioned to respond quickly to changing market dynamics."
Mr. Schatz continued, "We expect first quarter 2005 sales to be $83 million to $85 million, a 4 percent to 6 percent decline quarter over quarter. Despite the lower anticipated revenue level, we expect to return to operating profitability in the first quarter, as we begin to realize the initial cost benefits from our global manufacturing and supply-base initiatives."

known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the volatility and cyclicality of the semiconductor, semiconductor capital equipment and flat panel display industries, Advanced Energy's ongoing ability to develop new products in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes, the Company's successful completion of key initiatives such as the worldwide manufacturing realignment and the shift to Asian-based suppliers, and other risks described in Advanced Energy's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and statements, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) (in thousands, except per share data)
 
The following condensed consolidated statements of operations excluding certain (charges) benefits are presented to aid in understanding the operating results of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. These condensed consolidated statements of operations are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP) in the United States of America and may be different from similar measures used by other companies. The statement below presents adjusted net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude certain charges and benefits, and adjusted gross profit that is GAAP gross profit, adjusted to exclude inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory. Reconciliations from these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures reported under GAAP are included at the bottom of this statement. The inclusion of the charges and benefits herein does not necessarily indicate that such events will not recur in the future.
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) EXCLUDING CERTAIN (CHARGES) BENEFITS (in thousands, except per share data)
(1) The inventory write-down is primarily due to the product lifecycle management program, discontinuance of certain products in select markets, the product mix shift from 200mm wafers to 300mm wafers, and the expected continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry.
(2) The employee severance and termination costs consist of costs associated with the involuntary severance of approximately 225 employees at the Fort Collins facility. The need to reduce headcount in Fort Collins resulted primarily from the transfer of a substantial portion of manufacturing operations to Shenzhen, China. Additional charges are expected in the first half of 2005, primarily related to employees in the Hajiochi, Japan facility.

Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
On April 21, 2005, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. announced via press release its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005. A copy of the press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information
To supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements prepared under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP), Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. uses "non-GAAP financial measures," as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of adjusted net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude certain charges and benefits, and adjusted gross profit that is GAAP gross profit, adjusted to exclude inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory. Reconciliations from the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures reported under GAAP are included in the press release. Due to the amount of charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2004 as a result of realignment and other activities, Advanced Energy believes that the adjusted results are useful to investors to aid in understanding the operating results of the fourth quarter of 2004 and to make useful comparisons to the results of the first quarter of 2005. The management of Advanced Energy uses the adjusted results to analyze the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005 and to plan and forecast future periods. The non-GAAP measures used are neither in accordance with, nor alternatives for, the comparable GAAP measures, and may be materially different from similar non-GAAP measures reported by other companies. The presentation of this supplemental information should not be considered a substitute for the company's net income or gross profit determined in accordance with GAAP.
Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.
Reference is made to the press release of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. issued on April 21, 2005, regarding earnings guidance, which is incorporated herein by reference. A copy of the press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005. Advanced Energy offers a comprehensive suite of process-centered solutions critical to the production of semiconductors, flat panel displays, data storage products, architectural glass and other advanced product applications.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., April 21, 2005
For the 2005 first quarter, sales were $86.1 million, down 17.6% from first quarter 2004 sales of $104.5 million, and down 2.6% from fourth quarter 2004 sales of $88.4 million. Gross margin was 33.8% of sales in the first quarter of 2005 compared to 36.8% in the first quarter of 2004, and 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2004.
First quarter 2005 net income was $734,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2004 net income of $6.9 million or $0.21 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss of $23.0 million, or $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The first quarter 2005 results include $1.3 million of restructuring charges related to employee severance and termination costs. The first quarter 2004 results include $220,000 in restructuring charges related to employee severance and termination costs, and approximately $1.0 million in pre-tax gains resulting from the sale of certain marketable securities and the sale of the Company's thermal control business. The fourth quarter 2004 results include $19.8 million in pre-tax charges primarily attributable to increased excess and obsolete inventory reserves, a change in an accounting estimate related to demonstration equipment, employee severance and termination costs, and intangible asset impairments.
"The first quarter results reflect significant sequential improvement in gross margin, net income and cash generation ahead of plan. Our return to profitability demonstrates that our transition plans are on track. We
 
Advanced Energy Reports First Quarter 2005 Results  Page 2 April 21, 2005
anticipate the completion of our global manufacturing and supply base transitions over the next six to nine months. We believe these strategic initiatives provide us with a unique competitive advantage that will enable our continued innovation on many levels," stated Doug Schatz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy.
"Despite initial trend improvements in end user capacity and inventory levels, we continue to take a cautious outlook on the level of near term semiconductor industry demand. As a result, we anticipate second quarter revenue in the $86 million to $90 million range, and earnings per share in the range of $0.03 to $0.05," said Mr. Schatz.

CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) (in thousands, except per share data)
 
The following condensed consolidated statements of operations excluding certain (charges) benefits are presented to aid in understanding the operating results of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. These condensed consolidated statements of operations are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals (GAAP) in the United States of America and may be different from similar measures used by other companies. The statement below presents adjusted net income that is GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude certain charges and benefits, and adjusted gross profit that is GAAP gross profit, adjusted to exclude inventory write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory. Reconciliations from these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures reported under GAAP are included at the bottom of this statement. The inclusion of the charges and benefits herein does not necessarily indicate that such events will not recur in the future.
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED) EXCLUDING CERTAIN (CHARGES) BENEFITS (in thousands, except per share data)
A reconciliation of our gross profit and net income (loss) excluding certain (charges) benefits to the most directly comparable measures under generally accepted accounting principals in the United States of America is presented below:
(1) The inventory write-down in the fourth quarter of 2004 was primarily due to the product lifecycle management program, discontinuance of certain products in select markets, the product mix shift from 200mm wafers to 300mm wafers, and the expected continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry.
(2) The fourth quarter 2004 and first quarter 2005 employee severance and termination costs primarily consist of costs associated with the involuntary severance of approximately 225 employees at the Fort Collins facility. The need to reduce headcount in Fort Collins resulted primarily from the transfer of a substantial portion of manufacturing operations to Shenzhen, China.
(3) During the fourth quarter of 2004, as a result of the continuing process of obtaining and analyzing historical data and the Company's fiscal year 2005 operating plan for use of current and future demonstration equipment, the Company made a change in the estimated useful life of the demonstration equipment from two years to zero years. The Company's policy since this change is to record sales and marketing expense for the demonstration equipment as it is placed into service at our customers' or potential customers' location.
(4) The fourth quarter 2004 intangible asset impairment charge related to assets acquired in conjunction with the acquisitions of Aera and Dressler and were considered for impairment in conjunction with the Company's restructuring activities and 2005 operating plan.

Item 3.01 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.
On May 6, 2005, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the "") indicating that Advanced Energy is not in compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) ("") and, therefore, Advanced Energy's common stock is subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market effective May 17, 2005, unless Advanced Energy requests a hearing in accordance with the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4800 Series. The Nasdaq Letter further advises that the fifth character "E" will be appended to Advanced Energy's trading symbol at the opening of business on May 10, 2005. Advanced Energy issued a press release on May 9, 2005 regarding this letter, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
Nasdaq Letter
Rule 4310(c)(14)
Rule 4310(c)(14) requires Advanced Energy to file with The Nasdaq Stock Market copies of all reports and other documents filed or required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ) on or before the date they are filed with the SEC. The Nasdaq Letter contends that Advanced Energy has not complied with Rule 4310(c)(14), because Advanced Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 (the "") did not contain an opinion from Advanced Energy's independent auditor relating to management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Item 308 of Regulation S-K requires Advanced Energy to furnish in the 2004 Form 10-K an attestation report by its independent auditor on management's assessment of Advanced Energy's internal control over financial reporting.
"SEC"
2004 Form 10-K
Advanced Energy filed on March 31, 2005 the 2004 Form 10-K, which included management's assessment of Advanced Energy's internal control over financial reporting, as well as an attestation report by its independent auditor and audited financial statements with an unqualified opinion by the independent auditor; however, the auditor's attestation report provides that the scope of the auditor's work was not sufficient to enable it to express, and the auditor therefore did not express, an opinion either on management's assessment or on the effectiveness of Advanced Energy's internal control over financial reporting.
Advanced Energy believes that the inclusion of the auditor's attestation report, even though it does not express an opinion, constitutes compliance with Rule 4310(c)(14) and will request a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel in accordance with the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4800 Series. According to the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, the hearing request will stay the delisting of Advanced Energy's securities pending the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel's decision. Advanced Energy is also working with its independent auditors to resolve this issue. There can be no assurance that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel will determine that Advanced Energy is in compliance with Rule 4310(c)(14) or otherwise grant Advanced Energy's request for continued listing.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced it received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market on May 6, 2005 indicating that Advanced Energy is not in compliance with the filing requirement for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) due to the lack of an attestation on internal control from its independent auditor under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Unless Advanced Energy requests a hearing in accordance with the Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4800 Series, Advanced Energy's common stock is subject to delisting from The Nasdaq Stock Market, effective May 17, 2005.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., May 9, 2005
Advanced Energy will request such a hearing before a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. According to Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, the hearing request will stay the delisting of Advanced Energy's securities pending the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel's decision.
Advanced Energy understands that until this issue is resolved, the fifth character "E" will be appended to its trading symbol, thereby changing its trading symbol to AEISE, as of the opening of business on May 10, 2005.
Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14) requires Advanced Energy to file with The Nasdaq Stock Market copies of all reports and other documents filed or required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on or before the date they are filed with the SEC. The Nasdaq letter contends that Advanced Energy has not complied with this requirement, because Advanced Energy's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 did not contain an
 
opinion from Advanced Energy's independent auditor relating to management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting. The report from Advanced Energy's independent auditor relating to internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Advanced Energy's 2004 Form 10-K, states that the auditor is not able to express an opinion on management's assessment or on the effectiveness of Advanced Energy's internal control over financial reporting.
Advanced Energy believes that the inclusion of the independent auditor's report in the 2004 Form 10-K constitutes compliance with Rule 4310(c)(14) and intends to present its arguments at the hearing before the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel. The Company is also working with its independent auditors to resolve this issue. There can be no assurance that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel will determine that Advanced Energy is in compliance with Rule 4310(c)(14) or otherwise grant Advanced Energy's request for continued listing.

You will also continue as a member of the Board.

In addition to the above base salary you are eligible for additional short and long term incentive compensation as available in accordance with company policy. Your current short-term incentive compensation will be in accordance with the Executive Compensation Plan for the Executive Leadership Team approved by the Board of Director's Compensation Committee in December 2004. This plan provides for a target cash bonus of 70% of base pay if certain objectives are reached. With an August 1 start date the award would be on a 5/12 prorated basis.

A copy of the 2005 Executive Compensation Plan has been provided to you separately.

The Board of Directors will grant to you an option to purchase 140,000 shares of Company common stock within one week following your start date. The option price will be the fair market value of the stock, which would be the closing price on the date of the grant. The vesting schedule for these options is 25% per year over four years on the anniversary date of the grant.
 
The RSUs will be granted in two tranches. The first tranche is for 50,000 RSUs and will be issued on your start date. The second tranche will be for an additional 15,000 units and will be issued on the second anniversary date of your start date. Both tranches will vest with the following schedule: 10% on the first anniversary date of the grant, 20% on the second anniversary date, 30% on the third anniversary date and 40% on the fourth anniversary date.
The company will also provide a sign-on bonus of $50,000 to be paid within 15 days after your start date.
We will offer you an executive change in control severance agreement the terms of which are outlined in the enclosed agreement.
All other terms of this offer will be in accordance with standard AE policy and cover such items including, but not limited to, medical, moving, vacation, disability and confidentiality. Copies of the documents containing such policies have been provided to you separately.
All benefits become effective the first of the month following your start date. Benefit programs are re-evaluated and are subject to change at any time, at the discretion of the company.
The information in this letter is not intended to constitute a contract of employment, either express or implied. Your employment with Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. shall be at will.
Hans, representing the full Board, and personally as the founder and retiring Chief Executive Officer, we are very excited that we have found such an outstanding leader to take the company to the next level of performance. Now, as the Chairman, I am looking forward to working with you and supporting your future successes.

Income from continuing operations was $3.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to net income of $734,000, or $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2005 and net income of $4.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2004. Included in the second quarter 2005 income from continuing operations is a $1.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, after-tax gain from the sale of certain marketable securities.
During the quarter, the Company sold its EMCO industrial flow product line resulting in income from discontinued operations of $2.6 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.
Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2005 was $173.5 million versus $213.4 million for the first six months of 2004.

Doug Schatz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy, said, "The second quarter results continue to demonstrate the significant improvements we have made to our operating model. Gross margin improved nearly three percentage points from the first quarter as we continue to realize benefits from our China manufacturing, localized supply chain programs and improvements resulting from the global restructuring actions. Operating income increased approximately 60 percent compared to the first quarter of 2005 on slightly increased

sequential sales, and was 6.2 percent of sales compared to 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 2005. In 2005, we have improved the balance sheet by generating cash from operations of over $30 million and by reducing inventory by approximately $14 million."
Mr. Schatz continued, "We have a renewed focus on profitable opportunities centered on our core technologies and have realigned our manufacturing infrastructure to benefit from lower-cost regions while maintaining product launch expertise at key sites. The manufacturing transition is in its final stages, and currently over 75 percent of our power product and mass flow control manufacturing volume is shipping from our Shenzhen, China location. We believe our China manufacturing facility provides us with a highly differentiated competitive position that enables us to better serve our global customer base with our high quality, innovative products."
"Our customers continue to take a cautious view of the near-term demand environment based on the anticipated timing of end user orders, and we anticipate third quarter revenue in the $81 million to $86 million range, the upper end of which is essentially flat with the second quarter if we adjust for the sale of EMCO. We anticipate earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.09 based on continued financial performance improvement," said Mr. Schatz.

     THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the 4th day of August, 2005 by and between ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC. ("the Company") and Linda Capuano ("Employee").
     (1) Employee was laid off from active employment with the Company effective August 22, 2005 ("Separation Date").
     (2) Within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the revocation period set forth in paragraph eight (8) below, the Company will pay Employee a lump sum in an amount totaling one hundred thirty five thousand dollars and zero cents ($135,000.00), subject to and less applicable withholdings.
     Employee's group health insurance benefits will terminate effective August 31, 2005. Following the Separation Date, Employee may continue Company group insurance benefits to the extent allowed under applicable law (i.e., COBRA).
     (3) On the Separation Date, the Company paid to Employee all paid time off earned and unused as of the Separation Date. However, Employee will not be entitled to or accrue any additional vacation or fringe benefit eligibility or participation following the Separation Date, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
     (4) Employee agrees that, except as Employee's responsibilities with the Company may require, Employee will not at any time disclose or use any confidential information or data acquired or developed during Employee's employment. Further, Employee agrees that Employee will not at any time engage in any conduct contrary to the interests of the Company or enable others to make use of sensitive or confidential information of or relating to the Company obtained during Employee's employment. If an Employee Agreement was executed, Employee understands and agrees that Employee remains bound by the provisions of said Employee Agreement which remains in full force and effect.
     (5) For a period of one year after Employee's Separation Date, Employee agrees that Employee will not, directly or indirectly, solicit any current employee of the Company, on Employee's behalf or on behalf of any other person, company, corporation, or other entity.
     (6) WAIVER AND RELEASE BY EMPLOYEE. In consideration of the payments and other consideration as set out in this Agreement, the Employee, Employee's marital community, Employee's heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, hereby knowingly and voluntarily waives, releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company, and all of its affiliates, partners, subsidiaries and their respective agents, officers, directors, shareholders and employees from any liability, action, suit, claim, damages, judgment, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or contingent which Employee has ever had or ever may have, arising out of or in conjunction with Employee's employment with the Company or any of its predecessors or affiliates or the termination thereof, including, without limitation, claims under federal, state or local common law or statute, as well as any form of employment discrimination
 
prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, ERISA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and any other local, state or federal anti-discrimination law or ordinance, any applicable collective bargaining agreement, any applicable wage and hour laws, and from wrongful discharge, severance pay, breach of contract, breach of any express or implied promise, retaliation, breach of public policy, defamation, negligence or other tortious conduct, or any other theory, whether legal or equitable, including any claims which could have been asserted up to the date of execution of this Agreement.
     The release of claims included in this Agreement is, and is intended to be, broad and comprehensive and, therefore, covers all claims of whatsoever character and kind, whether known or unknown, and whether wholly or partially matured on or before the date this Agreement is executed. Employee expressly waives and relinquishes any and all rights and benefits employee has or may have been afforded by any applicable statute or common law principle relating to limitations on a release of claims, including without limitation Section 1542 of the California Civil Code which states as follows:
     
A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by her must have materially affected her settlement with the debtor.
     Employee acknowledges and understands the significance of this specific waiver of her rights, including without limitation those provided by Section 1542 of the California Civil Code.
     (7) Employee is hereby advised to consult with an attorney prior to executing this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that Employee has been granted a period of twenty-one (21) days following the Separation Date within which to consider this Agreement. Employee acknowledges that if Employee executes this Agreement prior to the expiration of twenty-one (21) days following the Separation Date, or if Employee chooses to forego the advice of an attorney, Employee does so freely and knowingly, and waives any and all future claims that such action or actions would affect the validity of this Agreement.
     (8) Employee may revoke this Agreement within seven (7) calendar days after signing it. Notice of revocation must be made in writing and must be received by Edward Hernandez at Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., 1625 Sharp Point Drive, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525. If Employee revokes this Agreement, the Company will be immediately released of any further obligation under this Agreement, the Company may recover any payments already made under this Agreement, and this Agreement will not be effective or enforceable.
     (9) Employee covenants that Employee has not commenced, and will not commence, legal proceedings of any type, whether on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity, against the Company or individuals or entities released in this Agreement, or any of their respective successors or assigns, and further covenants not to maintain, join or assist in any such legal proceeding, suit, charge, or action.
 
     (10) If Employee breaches Employee's promise in paragraph (9) and files a lawsuit based on legal claims that Employee has released, Employee will pay for all costs incurred by the Company, any related subsidiaries, officers, or employees of any of them, including reasonable attorneys' fees, in defending against Employee's claim. Employee will also return all sums which were paid to Employee pursuant to this Agreement.
     (11) Employee agrees to keep the terms of this Agreement strictly confidential and not to disclose those terms to anyone, except a spouse, attorney, or tax adviser, unless compelled to do so by compulsory court process. The parties agree that this confidentiality provision is a material term of this Agreement.
     (12) This Agreement shall be interpreted under the laws of the State of Colorado, without giving effect to conflict of law principles.
     (13) If any portion of this Agreement shall be held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected.
     (14) This Agreement supersedes any previous understandings, agreements or correspondence of the parties on this subject and is binding on the parties, their heirs, executors, administrators, and successors in interest including without limitation the Executive Change in Control Severance Agreement between Employee and the Company.
 
     (15) This document is the entire Agreement between Employee and the Company. The Company has made no promises to Employee other than those in this Agreement. This Agreement may not be changed orally, only in a written document signed by both Employee and the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, the parties shall be deemed to have participated equally in its drafting.
     (16) Advanced Energy's D & O insurance coverage indemnifies you against any future claims against acts occurring during your employment period at Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

Reimbursement of Underwriters' Expenses.
     8.  (a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers, employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the registration statement for the registration of the Securities as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; , , that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion therein. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have.
Indemnification and Contribution.
provided
however
     (b) Each Underwriter severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing indemnity. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth in the last paragraph of the cover page regarding delivery of the Securities and,
 
20
under the heading "Underwriting" or "Plan of Distribution", (i) the list of Underwriters and their respective participation in the sale of the Securities, (ii) the sentences related to concessions and reallowances, (iii) the paragraph related to stabilization, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids and (iv) the information relating to the availability and delivery of the electronic prospectus, in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf of the several Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus,.
     (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below); , , that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.

21
     (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities; , , that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph (d).
provided
however
     9. If any one or more Underwriters shall fail to purchase and pay for any of the Securities agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter or Underwriters hereunder and such failure to purchase shall constitute a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the remaining Underwriters
Default by an Underwriter.
 
22
shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions which the amount of Securities set forth opposite their names in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all the remaining Underwriters) the Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase; , , that in the event that the aggregate amount of Securities which the defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase shall exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto, the remaining Underwriters shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Securities, and if such nondefaulting Underwriters do not purchase all the Securities, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter or the Company. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section 9, the Closing Date or any settlement date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding five Business Days, as the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any defaulting Underwriter of its liability, if any, to the Company and any nondefaulting Underwriter for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.
provided

     10.  This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Representatives, by notice given to the Company prior to delivery of and payment for the Securities, if at any time prior to such time (i) trading in the Company's Common Stock shall have been suspended by the Commission or the Nasdaq National Market or trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market shall have been suspended or limited or minimum prices shall have been established on the Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, (ii) a banking moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State authorities or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial markets is such as to make it, in the sole judgment of the Representatives, impractical or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Securities as contemplated by the Final Prospectus (exclusive of any supplement thereto).
Termination.
     11.  The respective agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On August 29, 2005, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. and Applied Materials Inc. entered into a Global Supply Agreement, or GSA, and a Freight Amendment to the GSA. The GSA, as amended by the Freight Amendment, sets forth terms and conditions governing sales of specified products, referred to in the GSA as "Items," and services to Applied Materials and its subsidiaries by Advanced Energy during the term of the GSA, including terms relating to pricing and payment; purchase order, acceptance and cancellation procedures; shipping and delivery; inventory management; warranty and repair and support services; and indemnification of Applied Materials by Advanced Energy. The GSA sets forth base pricing for each of the Items covered by the GSA, as well as the terms and conditions under which such pricing can be adjusted. The GSA does not require Applied Materials to purchase any level of Items or services from Advanced Energy. The GSA also provides for categorization of Items and designation of Advanced Energy's and Applied Materials' intellectual property rights with respect to the Items in each category. Such intellectual property rights include Applied Materials' rights to royalties on specified sales of Items in certain categories. The GSA also imposes limitations on Advanced Energy's use and disclosure of confidential and proprietary information relating to Applied Materials and its business and products. The GSA will expire on August 29, 2008, but is subject to extension for an additional six months at Applied Materials' option, as well as early termination by Applied Materials in accordance with the terms of the GSA.
Applied Materials is Advanced Energy's largest customer, based on sales. Sales to Applied Materials accounted for 23% of Advanced Energy's total sales in the first six months of 2005 and 27% of Advanced Energy's total sales in the full year 2004.

Each such royalty report shall be maintained confidential and not disclosed to MKS. However, at the request of legal counsel for MKS, the independent firm shall provide (on an attorneys' eyes only basis) the quantity of Licensed Products sold for each royalty rate listed in the royalty report. The payment In United States dollars for the royalties due, shall be sent to MKS at the address specified in Section 5.11, or at such other address as MKS shall, from time-to-time, specify to Advanced Energy by written notice.

Advanced Energy shall submit a quarterly royalty report in the manner provided herein corresponding to each of the first six quarters ending after the Effective Date. The royalty reports shall contain all particulars that may be necessary for the purpose of determining the amounts payable to MKS hereunder. In addition, these reports shall include at least the following:
 
     3.11.1 name, model number, order (or invoice) number, and quantity provided;
     3.11.2 accounting for Net Sales, including Advanced Energy's invoice amount and the applicable deductions; and
     3.11.3 royalty rates and royalties due under Section 3.8.

     3.13 The amounts due under Section 3.8 shall, if overdue, bear interest until payment at a per-annum rate Two Percentage points (2%) above the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the due date, provided, however, that if the amount of such late payment charge exceeds the maximum permitted by law for any such charge., such charge shall be reduced to such maximum amount. The payment of such interest shall not foreclose MKS from exercising any other rights it may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment.
     3.14 In the event the exchange rate specified in Section 3.9 shall be discontinued, or the prime rate specified in Section 3.13 becomes unavailable for any reason, the exchange or prime rate issued by the largest bank in New York City in terms of assets, issuing an exchange or prime rate, shall be used.
     3.15 Advanced Energy shall keep full, true and accurate books of account containing all particulars that may be necessary for the purpose of determining the amounts payable to MKS hereunder. Said books of account (and all other records and accounts as may, under recognized accounting practices, contain information bearing upon the amount of royalty payable to MKS under this Settlement Agreement) shall be kept at Advanced Energy in its Fort Collins, Colorado facility. Said books and the supporting data shall be open at all reasonable times for three (3) years following the end of the calendar year to which they pertain, to the inspection of the independent firm specified in Section 3.9, solely at the discretion of MKS, for the purpose of verifying Advanced Energy's royalty statement or compliance in other respects with this Settlement Agreement. MKS shall have the right to have such independent firm conduct such inspection at such Advanced Energy facility once per year after providing thirty (30) days written notice to Advanced Energy. Should such inspection lead to the discovery of a greater than five percent (5%) discrepancy in royalty reporting to the detriment of MKS, Advanced Energy agrees to pay the full cost of such inspection.
     3.16 Prompt adjustment shall be made to the proper party to compensate for any errors or omissions disclosed by such examination or audit. Neither such right to examine and audit nor the right to receive such adjustments shall be affected by any statement to the contrary, appearing on checks or otherwise, unless such statement appears in a letter signed by the party having such right and delivered to the other party, expressly waiving such right.
 
     3.17 Advanced Energy shall at all times during the term of this Settlement Agreement and thereafter, indemnify, defend and hold MKS, its trustees, directors, officers, employees and affiliates, harmless against all claims, proceedings, demands and liabilities of any kind whatsoever, including legal expenses and reasonable attorneys fees, arising out of the death of or injury to any person or persons or out of any damage to property, resulting from the production, manufacture, sale, use, lease, consumption or advertisement of the Licensed Products or arising from any obligation of Advanced Energy hereunder.

Unvested options totaling 852,000 that have an exercise price less than $15.00 per share that were outstanding as of October 18, 2005 will continue to vest on their normal schedule.
Vesting was accelerated for stock options held by directors and executive officers of the Company, as follows:
The Board of Directors determined to accelerate the vesting of these options principally to reduce future compensation expense that would otherwise be required to be recorded in the statement of operations in periods following the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, ("SFAS 123R"). The Company will be required to apply the expense recognition provisions of SFAS 123R beginning in the first quarter of 2006. As a result of the acceleration, before considering expected forfeitures, as required by SFAS 123R, the Company expects to eliminate a total of approximately $5 million to $6 million of compensation expense on a pre-tax basis over fiscal years 2006, 2007 and 2008. The vesting acceleration of these stock options is not expected to result in a charge to earnings based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     Sales down 12 percent year-over-year, gross margin higher by 5 percent as operational improvement continues
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2005.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., October 19, 2005
For the 2005 third quarter, sales were $82.0 million, down 6.2 percent compared to second quarter 2005 sales of $87.4 million, and down 12.4 percent from third quarter 2004 sales of $93.6 million. Third quarter 2005 gross margin improved to 37.0 percent of sales compared to 36.7 percent of sales in the second quarter of 2005, and 31.8 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2004.
Operating income was $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2005, compared to $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2005, and $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2004. Third quarter 2005 operating income includes a $3.0 million litigation settlement charge.
The net loss for the 2005 third quarter was $3.9 million, or $0.10 per share. Third quarter net loss includes the previously mentioned $3.0 million litigation settlement, $2.1 million related to the early retirement of the convertible debt, and a non-cash charge of $1.1 million related to the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs. The third quarter of 2005 net loss includes a tax provision of $1.6 million on pretax income earned outside of the United States. The company is unable to provide a tax benefit from its U.S. tax-loss carryforwards until it has demonstrated sustained profitability in the United States. Pretax losses were incurred in the third quarter of 2005 in the United States primarily due to the litigation settlement and debt costs detailed above.
Second quarter 2005 net income was $5.9 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. Second quarter 2005 income from continuing operations was $3.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Included in the second quarter 2005 income from continuing operations was an after-tax gain from the sale of certain marketable securities of $1.1 million. The third quarter 2004 net loss was $1.1 million, or $0.03 per share.
Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 was $255.5 million compared to $306.9 million for the first nine months of 2004. Net income from continuing operations for the 2005 nine-month period was $147,000, or
 
Advanced Energy Reports Third Quarter 2005 Results  Page 2 October 19, 2005
$0.00 per diluted share, compared to net income for the 2004 nine-month period of $10.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted share.
During the third quarter of 2005, the Company completed a public offering of 11.5 million shares. The net proceeds to the Company totaled $105.7 million, which were used toward the redemption of the Company's convertible subordinated notes. The redemption was completed during third quarter of 2005.
Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer, said, "We were pleased that our operating performance improved despite the lower revenue caused principally by soft demand from the semiconductor equipment customer base. These operational improvements, combined with the recently completed financing and redemption of the convertible debt, have improved our balance sheet as we generated $5.4 million of cash from operations. Our factory in Shenzhen, China is fully operational and we are well positioned for further improvements in capability and capacity.
"Our innovative product portfolio continues to be validated across existing and emerging end markets through additional design wins on an array of technology platforms. We continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities that best leverage our differentiated technology and global infrastructure in the markets we currently serve, and beyond," said Dr. Betz.
"We expect the soft demand environment for semiconductor equipment to continue in the near term. We anticipate fourth quarter 2005 revenue in the $75 million to $80 million range, and earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.07," said Dr. Betz.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2005.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., February 16, 2006
For the 2005 fourth quarter, sales were $80.4 million, up 2.1 percent compared to $78.8 million in the third quarter of 2005, and down 5.2 percent compared to $84.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Gross profit was $30.2 million, or 37.6 percent of sales for the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to $28.9 million, or 36.7 percent of sales in the third quarter of 2005, and $13.3 million, or 15.7 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Income from continuing operations was $5.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2005, compared to a loss from continuing operations of $4.2 million, or $0.11 per share, in the third quarter of 2005, and a loss from continuing operations of $23.3 million, or $0.71 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2004. Fourth quarter 2005 income from continuing operations reflects a tax rate of 21 percent, which is lower than the Company's anticipated tax rate of 40 percent due to the mix of foreign and domestic income in the respective taxing jurisdictions, allowing the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards.

Net income from discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2005 was $312,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, and $340,000, or $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Fourth quarter 2005 net income was $10.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $3.9 million, or $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2005, and a net loss of $23.0 million, or $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2004.
The third quarter 2005 net loss included a $3.0 million litigation settlement, $2.1 million related to the early retirement of the convertible debt, and a non-cash charge of $1.1 million related to the write-off of deferred debt issuance costs.

Advanced Energy Reports Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2005 Results  Page 2 February 16, 2006
Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy, said, "We continue to improve our gross margin even on relatively flat sequential sales volumes," said Dr. Betz. "Incremental operating margin above our $66 million break even level was approximately 44 percent, and we expect additional improvements throughout the year as we continue to benefit from the increasing capability of our worldwide manufacturing operations."
Sales for the 2005 fiscal year were $325.5 million, a 14.5 percent decrease compared to net sales of $380.5 million in fiscal year 2004. Net income for the year was $12.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $12.7 million, or $0.39 per share in fiscal year 2004.

"We are currently experiencing increased demand for our innovative portfolio of solutions that enable advanced processing," said Dr. Betz. "During the fourth quarter, we made progress in further penetrating emerging opportunities in the solar market with both our DC and RF power platforms, and in flat panel display with our RF technology for a new etch application. We are well-positioned to apply our technology leadership and worldwide manufacturing excellence to a diverse set of high-growth, high-profitability opportunities."
Dr. Betz continued, "Based on improving order trends, we currently expect first quarter 2006 sales to be $88 million to $91 million.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., April 26, 2006
Sales were $94.0 million for the first quarter of 2006, up 16.9% compared to $80.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, and up 14.3% compared to $82.2 million in the first quarter of 2005. Gross profit was $38.6 million, or 41.0% of sales, compared to $30.2 million, or 37.6% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2005, and $27.3 million, or 33.2% of sales in the first quarter of 2005.
First quarter 2006 income from operations was $13.2 million, or 14.0% of sales, an increase of 111.3% compared to $6.2 million, or 7.8% of sales, in the fourth quarter of 2005. This compares to first quarter 2005 income from operations of $2.5 million, or 3.1% of sales. First quarter 2006 income from operations includes $641,000 of stock-based compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). First quarter 2005 income from operations includes $1.3 million of restructuring charges related to employee severance and termination costs.
First quarter 2006 net income was $12.8 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to net income of $10.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005, and $734,000 in the first quarter of 2005, or $0.02 per diluted share. First quarter 2006 net income includes a $1.4 million gain, primarily related to the sale of equity securities, which favorably impacts diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.02. First quarter 2006 net income reflects a tax rate of 15%, which is lower than the Company's anticipated tax rate of 20% due to the mix of foreign and domestic income in the respective taxing jurisdictions and the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards which had valuation allowances recorded against them.
Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy, said, "Our first quarter performance demonstrates a strong demand environment for our innovative power generation solutions. The sequential sales increase was primarily driven by sales to the semiconductor industry. Shipments of our Pinnacle DC power supply
 
Advanced Energy Reports First Quarter 2006 Results  Page 2 April 26, 2006
for use in semiconductor and Generation 5 flat panel display applications were at near record levels. Today, we announced a significant win for our Crystal AC power solutions for a major architectural glass retrofit opportunity that is expected to drive increased sales to this market over the next twelve months. Outside of our core markets, we also marked another milestone in our objective to penetrate the solar cell manufacturing market, winning a new position at ECD Ovonics to provide process power using our Cesar RF generators and VarioMatch matching networks."
Dr. Betz continued, "We also continue to make significant progress in our financial performance. We were encouraged by the operating performance as our factory in Shenzhen, China is fully ramped, and gross margin this quarter was at its highest level in five years. Based on the continued strength in end market demand, we currently expect second quarter 2006 sales to be in the range of $98 million to $102 million. We anticipate earnings per share in the range of $0.27 to $0.29."

May 24, 2006
Registrant's telephone number, including area code:
(970) 221-4670
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 24, 2006, the stockholders of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. approved an amendment to the registrant's 2003 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan to expand the forms of awards that may be granted thereunder to include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights. Prior to the amendment, awards under the plan could only be in the form of stock options. As previously reported, in January 2006, the registrant revised its non-employee director compensation structure to provide for automatic grants to the non-employee directors of restricted stock units, instead of stock options.
The foregoing is a summary of the amendment to the 2003 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan. A complete copy of the 2003 Non-Employee Directors' Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated as of February 15, 2006, and a form of the restricted stock unit award agreement are filed as exhibits to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and the terms of such plan and form of award agreement are incorporated herein by reference.
Also, on May 24, 2006, the stockholders of the registrant re-elected to the Board of Directors the seven incumbent directors and newly elected to the Board of Directors Thomas Rohrs, a non-employee director. Accordingly, on May 24, 2006, the registrant awarded 2,000 restricted stock units to each of Richard Beck, Joseph Bronson, Trung Doan, Barry Posner and Elwood Spedden, and awarded 5,000 restricted stock units to Mr. Rohrs.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
     (c) The following exhibits are filed pursuant to Item 1.01:
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
EXHIBIT 10.1
     1. . The purpose of the Plan is to attract and retain the services of experienced and knowledgeable non-employee directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., and to provide an incentive for such directors to increase their proprietary interests in the Company's long-term success and progress.
PURPOSE
     2. . Whenever the following terms are used in the Plan, they shall have the meaning indicated below, unless a different meaning is required by the context.
DEFINITIONS
     3. . The Plan shall be administered by a committee selected by the Board consisting of at least 2 individuals each of whom is either (i) a member of the Board and not a Non-Employee Director or (ii) a senior officer of the Company who is not a member of the Board. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator shall have the authority to determine all other matters relating to administration and operation of the Plan. All questions of interpretation, implementation, and application of the Plan shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole discretion. Such determinations shall be final and binding on all persons.
ADMINISTRATION
 
     4. . The maximum number of Shares that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the Plan is two hundred fifty thousand (250,000), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6(b) and subject to limited re-issuance as indicated below. If an award expires, is surrendered, or in the case of options becomes unexercisable without having been exercised in full, the unissued or retained Shares shall become available for future grant under the Plan. Other Shares that actually have been issued under the Plan pursuant to an award shall not be returned to the Plan and shall not become available for future grant under the Plan.
SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN
     5. . A Non-Employee Director may receive awards under this Plan on the terms and conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7. No other person may benefit under this Plan.
ELIGIBILITY
     6. .
GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
     (a)  On and after the date of the annual meeting of the Company's stockholders to be held in 2006, and subject to adjustment under Section 6(b), a Non-Employee Director will automatically receive five thousand (5,000) Restricted Stock Units on the date first elected or appointed as a member of the Board and (ii) two thousand (2,000) Restricted Stock Units on any date re-elected (or first elected after an appointment) as a member of the Board by the Company's stockholders. Any such grant will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan, and will be evidenced by written notice in such form as the Administrator shall determine. Pursuant to Section 7, the form of award granted may be changed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors
Automatic Grants.
     (b) . In the event of any merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, separation, liquidation or other change in the corporate structure or capitalization affecting the Shares, appropriate adjustment shall be made by the Administrator in the kind, price, and number of shares of stock (including, but not limited to, the maximum number of Shares reserved under the Plan) that are or may become subject to the Plan. If in connection with the change the Company ceases to exist, the surviving or successor entity must either assume the Company's rights and obligations with respect to outstanding awards or substitute for outstanding awards substantially equivalent awards for equity interests in the entity. If there is no surviving or successor entity, a Non-Employee Director's outstanding option shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the date seven (7) calendar days before the change. Restricted Stock and Restricted
Changes in Capitalization or Corporate Transaction
 
Stock Units shall vest upon consummation of the change. The exercise of any option that was permissible solely by reason of the change shall be conditioned upon consummation of the change. Options that are neither assumed, substituted nor exercised as of the time of the change shall terminate and cease to be outstanding.
     (c) . The Administrator shall have the power to modify, extend, or renew an outstanding award granted under this Plan, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Plan, provided that any such action may not significantly impair the awardholder's rights without his or her consent. However, the Company will not reduce the exercise price of any outstanding option or cancel outstanding options and grant replacement options with a lower exercise price without the prior approval of the shareholders.
Amendment
     7. .
AWARDS
     (a) Awards may take the form of Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock and/or Stock Options. The form of award granted under the Plan may be changed from time to time by resolution of the Board of Directors. Restricted Stock Units will be granted upon approval of this amended and restated Plan.
     (b) Restricted Stock Units
 
 
     (c) Restricted Stock
 
     (d) Options
 
     8. . The Administrator may award a right to receive in cash the amount that the Fair Market Value of a Share exceeds a stated exercise price (a "stock appreciation right" or "SAR") to a person eligible under Section 5 on such terms that the Administrator shall determine, consistent
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
 
with the terms of this Plan. A SAR shall be subject to the same general terms that apply to an option granted hereunder, including (but not limited to) the terms set forth in Sections 6, 7, 9 and 10 as appropriately modified. An exercised SAR will reduce the Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan under Section 4.
     9. . An option shall cease to be exercisable after the earlier of (i) six (6) months after the date the Non-Employee Director ceases to be a member of the Board (including by reason of death), (ii) the occurrence of a Change in Control and (iii) the 10 anniversary of the date of grant; provided, however, that in the case of a Non-Employee Director who has served continuously as a member of the Board for at least five (5) years, the period described in clause (i) shall be eighteen (18) months.
TERMINATION OF OPTIONS
th
     10. . A Non-Employee Director's outstanding option shall become fully exercisable as of the date seven (7) calendar days before a Change in Control. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units shall vest upon consummation of the Change in Control. The exercise of any option that was permissible solely by reason of a Change in Control shall be conditioned upon consummation of the Change in Control. Options that are not exercised as of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding. A Change in Control means a single Ownership Change Event or combination of proximate (in time, purpose, cause and effect, and/or the identity of the parties involved) Ownership Change Events (collectively, a "Transaction") wherein the stockholders of the Company immediately before the Transaction do not retain immediately after the Transaction, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of shares of the Company's voting stock immediately before the Transaction, direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the total combined voting power of the outstanding voting stock of the Company or the company or companies to which the assets of the Company were transferred (the "Transferee Company(s)"), as the case may be. For purposes of the preceding sentence, indirect beneficial ownership shall include, without limitation, an interest resulting from ownership of the voting stock of one or more companies which, as a result of the Transaction, own the Company or the Transferee Company(ies), as the case may be, either directly or through one or more subsidiary companies. An Ownership Change Event means (i) the direct or indirect sale, exchange or transfer of the voting stock of the Company, (ii) a merger or consolidation in which the Company is a party, (iii) the sale, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or (iv) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company. The Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine whether any particular facts and circumstances constitute an Ownership Change Event or a Transaction, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive.
CHANGE IN CONTROL
 
     11. . All awards under this plan shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or foreign law with respect to such securities. Options may not be exercised if the issuance of Shares upon exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange or market system upon which the Shares may then be listed. In addition, no option may be exercised unless (i) a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act") shall at the time of exercise of the option be in effect with respect to the Shares issuable upon exercise of the option, or (ii) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the Shares issuable upon exercise of the option may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares hereunder shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of any option, the Company may require a Non-Employee Director to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company.
SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE
     12. .
MISCELLANEOUS
     (a) . A Non-Employee Director shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to the Shares covered by his or her awards until the date of the issuance to him or her of a stock certificate for the Shares.
No Stockholders' Rights
     (b) . Neither the Plan, nor the granting of an award, nor any other action taken under the Plan, shall be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that a Non-Employee Director has a right to continue as a member of the Board for any period of time or rate of compensation.
No Right to Serve
     (c) . Any person who makes a claim for benefits under the Plan or under any award agreement entered into pursuant to the Plan shall file the claim in writing with the Administrator. Written notice of the disposition of the claim shall be delivered to the claimant within 60 days after filing. If the claim is denied, the Administrator's written decision shall set forth (i) the specific reason or reasons for the denial, (ii) a specific reference to the pertinent provisions of the Plan or award agreement on which the denial is based, and (iii) a description of any additional material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect his or her claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary. No lawsuit may be filed by the claimant until a claim is made and denied pursuant to this subsection.
Claims
 
     (d) s. In any legal action or other proceeding brought by either party to enforce or interpret the terms of the award agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
Attorneys' Fee
     (e) . An award grant shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Company or its stockholders to make or authorize any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations, or other changes in the Company's capital structure or its business, or any merger or consolidation of any member of the Company or any issue of bonds, debentures, or preferred or preference stocks affecting the Shares or the rights thereof, or of any rights, options, or warrants to purchase any capital stock of the Company, or the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any sale or transfer of all or any part of its assets or business, or any other corporate act or proceedings of the Company, whether of a similar character or otherwise.
Company Free to Act
     (f) . If any provision of the Plan or award agreement, or its application to any person, place, or circumstance, is held by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, that provision shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law, and the remainder of this Plan and award agreement and of that provision shall remain in full force and effect as applied to other persons, places, and circumstances.
Severability
     (g) . This Plan and the award agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado applicable to contracts wholly made and performed in the State of Colorado.
Governing Law
     (h) . So long as Shares are listed on any established stock exchange or traded on the NASDAQ National Market or the NASDAQ SmallCap Market, the applicable requirements of any such exchange or market shall be hereby incorporated by reference.
Exchange Requirements
     (i) . So long as any of the Company's equity securities are registered pursuant to Section 12(b) or 12(g) of the 1934 Act, with respect to awards granted to or held by Section 16 insiders, the Plan will comply in all respects with Rule 16b-3 or any successor rule or rule of similar application under Section 16 of the 1934 Act or rules thereunder, and, if any Plan provision is later found not to be in compliance with such exemption under Section 16, that provision shall be deemed modified as necessary to meet the requirements of such applicable exemption.
Compliance with Section 16
 
     13. The Plan will become effective upon adoption by the Board, subject to approval by the Company's stockholders. The Plan shall terminate on the 10th anniversary of its adoption.
EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE PLAN.
     14. . With the approval of the Board, the Administrator may suspend or discontinue the Plan or revise or amend it in any respect whatsoever; provided, however, that without approval of the Company's stockholders no revision or amendment shall change the number of Shares issuable under the Plan (except as provided in Section 6(b)), change the designation of the class of individuals eligible to receive awards, or materially increase the benefits accruing to Non-Employee Directors under the Plan.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Definitive Material Contract
Director Compensation Structure
On July 24, 2006, Advanced Energy Industries' independent compensation consultant presented to the Board of Directors the consultant's report on, among other things, non-employee director compensation. Based on the data contained in such report, we determined to revise the equity component of the non-employee director compensation structure to increase the number of restricted stock units to be granted to non-employee directors upon initial election or appointment to the board and upon re-election. We also determined to make a one-time grant of restricted stock units to each of the incumbent non-employee directors who is re-elected at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which we currently anticipate to be held in May 2007. We intend to implement these revisions to the non-employee director compensation structure by amending the 2003 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, subject to shareholder approval at the 2007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If the stockholders approve the amendments to the plan, compensation for each non-employee director will be as follows:
In addition, each incumbent non-employee director who is re-elected at the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders will be granted 10,000 restricted stock units upon such re-election. Such restricted stock units will vest in equal installments over four years, contingent upon the recipient continuing to be a director of the company.

Sales were $107.7 million for the third quarter of 2006, up 3.0% compared to $104.6 million for the second quarter of 2006, and up 36.7% compared to $78.8 million for the third quarter of 2005. Gross profit was $47.0 million, or 43.7% of sales, compared to $44.8 million, or 42.8% of sales, in the second quarter of 2006, and $28.9 million, or 36.7% of sales in the third quarter of 2005.
Third quarter 2006 income from operations was $18.3 million or 17.0% of sales, compared to $19.2 million, or 18.4% of sales, in the second quarter of 2006. This compares to third quarter 2005 income from operations of $2.2 million, or 2.8% of sales. Third quarter 2005 income from operations includes a $3.0 million litigation settlement expense.
Third quarter 2006 net income was $17.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $18.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006, and compared to a net loss of $3.9 million, or a net loss of $0.10 per share in the third quarter of 2005.
Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy, said, "Sales continued at record levels in the third quarter, driven by continued strength in sales to semiconductor and advanced products customers. Within the advanced products category, sales to solar panel customers increased 42% sequentially as our strategy to grow our presence in this market continues to progress. Our operational focus drove additional efficiency gains, highlighted by a 90 basis point sequential improvement in gross margin. Cash increased by $22.7 million in the third quarter."
Dr. Betz continued, "As you have seen from our guidance, following four quarters of increasing sales to the semiconductor industry, we expect semiconductor levels to decrease modestly in the fourth quarter as semiconductor manufacturers carefully manage inventory levels. We expect growing demand in our emerging

markets, such as solar and architectural glass, as these markets continue their capital investment cycle to adopt leading edge technology. We will leverage the strength of our financial model, combined with technology innovation and optimized global operations, to pursue an expanding set of opportunities within core and emerging markets."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2006. Sales were $104.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2006, down 3% compared to $107.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, and up 30% compared to $80.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2005. Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $16.6 million, or 16% of sales, compared to $18.3 million, or 17% of sales in the third quarter of 2006, and $6.2 million, or 8% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Fort Collins, Colo., February 7, 2007
Fourth quarter 2006 income from continuing operations was $39.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted share compared to $17.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006, and $5.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company reversed its valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets and accrued taxes for the year at the full tax rate which resulted in a net tax benefit of $23.5 million, or $0.52 per share. Excluding the net tax benefit of $23.5 million related to income taxes, and using the same effective tax rate as the third quarter of 2006, income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2006 would have been $15.9 million, or $0.35 per diluted share.
Sales for 2006 were a record $410.7 million, a 26% increase over $325.5 million in 2005. Net income was $88.3 million, or $1.95 per diluted share, for 2006 including the income tax benefit mentioned above. Net income for 2005 was $12.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share.
Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy, said, "2006 was an outstanding year as the results of our initiatives improved our financial performance significantly. Our operating model complements the capability of our global infrastructure, and positions the company for future profitable growth. Our strategy, which focused on power conversion and flow control technologies, has enabled our growth throughout the year, particularly to sales to non-semiconductor markets. Sales to the solar industry tripled in 2006 over 2005, and sales to the architectural glass industry set a company record, more than doubling over 2005. We believe that we have built a global team and a platform that is scalable and capable of capturing future growth opportunities."

The financial measures set forth above that present the financial results excluding certain charges and benefits, are not in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide further insight into the results of operations and enhance the consistency and comparability of those results to results in prior periods because they assist shareholder understanding of the effects of certain charges and benefits on the quarter's results.

On March 1, 2007, the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.

The closure will result in the elimination of approximately 65 employee positions and is expected to be complete by October 31, 2007. The decision to close the Stolberg facility was based on improving overall efficiency and leveraging the Company's global operations infrastructure. Production will be transferred to the Company's facilities in Shenzhen, China and Fort Collins, Colorado.
The Company is currently unable to estimate the following in connection with this closure:

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced plans to transfer manufacturing operations from the Stolberg, Germany site to the Company's manufacturing locations in Shenzhen, China, and Fort Collins, Colorado, and subsequently close its Stolberg facility. Product design, sales and service functions will be reassigned to the Filderstadt, Germany and Fort Collins, Colorado locations. This transition is expected to be completed by October 31, 2007.
Fort Collins, Colo., March 2, 2007
Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy, said, "While the Stolberg facility has contributed to our success over the years, our strategy to drive operational efficiencies on a global scale is clear, and we faced a difficult decision whether to invest in an expansion of our factory in Germany or leverage the infrastructure that we have built in China. As a result of this decision, we will narrow our focus in operations and achieve greater efficiencies in the long term by transferring these lines to our high volume manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China, and our advanced manufacturing facility in Fort Collins, Colorado."
Mr. Betz continued, "This is a difficult decision for the Company, given our talented workforce in Stolberg. The transition will impact approximately 65 employees over the course of the next several months. The Stolberg team has been a dedicated group of employees, committed to meeting our critical objectives, and we thank them for their hard work."
 
Advanced Energy acquired the Stolberg location through the acquisition of Dressler HF Technik GmbH in March 2002. Since that time, the location has continued design, manufacturing and support for the DresslerRF power product line, including the Cesar power generator, which is sold primarily to semiconductor capital equipment and solar cell manufacturing customers. Other Dressler RF products manufactured in Stolberg include the VarioMatch matching network, the HPG high power generator, and the LPPA linear amplifier. The site currently contributes approximately 5% of the Company's total annual revenue.

The Company will file an amended report on Form 8-K under Item 2.05 within four business days after it makes a determination of the anticipated restructuring charges related to the Stolberg facility closure.

ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
ITEM 5.05 AMENDMENT TO THE REGISTRANT'S CODE OF ETHICS, OR WAIVER OF A PROVISION OF THE CODE OF ETHICS
     On April 27, 2007, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the "Company") revised the Company's Code of Ethical Conduct (the "Code") applicable to officers and employees of the Company in order to express more completely the ethical principles and standards to be observed in the conduct of the Company's affairs. The revised Code expands upon issues previously discussed in the prior Code and delineates the Company's ethical policies and standards with respect to corporate opportunities, insider trading, record keeping, relationships with customers and suppliers and relationships with fellow employees. A copy of the revised Code is filed herewith as Exhibit 14.
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS
     (d) Exhibits
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
Exhibit 14
Advanced Energy is firmly committed to observing the highest standards of ethics and integrity in the conduct of its business. Advanced Energy and its family of companies (collectively, the "Company") have developed this Code of Ethical Conduct in order to emphasize to all employees the role of ethics, fairness and honesty in the performance of their jobs. At Advanced Energy, every employee should understand that ethics and integrity are not an obstruction to business, but rather are essential to doing business in the spirit of the Company's values.
General Statement of Business Philosophy
All employees of the Company are expected to exercise good judgment and the highest ethical standards in the conduct of the Company's affairs as well as in private activities that might affect the Company. In particular, every employee has an obligation to avoid any activity, agreement, business investment or interest, or other situation which is in conflict with the Company's interests or interferes with the duty to serve the Company at all times to the best of the person's ability.
Advanced Energy has established and will maintain a written program to ensure compliance with the law and with these and other policies the company may adopt. The program consists of, among other things, the Advanced Energy Code of Ethical Conduct, training programs, quarterly and annual certificates of compliance to be completed by key personnel, periodic audits, and an EthicsPoint compliance reporting line and website.
To implement this philosophy and to establish meaningful guidelines, this Code of Ethical Conduct has been adopted. Principles underlying Advanced Energy's code of ethics can be demonstrated by the interactions and business practices employees will likely have within the following groups:
The Company protects its shareholders, customers, vendors, and employees by upholding the commitment to ethical business practice standards, and by outlining guidelines that adhere to our overriding corporate dedication to the highest standards of ethics and governance.
 
Relationships with the Company and its Shareholders
Conflict of Interest and Disclosure
Each employee is responsible for avoiding conflicts of interest with the employee's duties to the Company, as well as the appearance of such conflicts. All employees must avoid any activity that is or has the appearance of being hostile, adverse or competitive with Advanced Energy, or that interferes with the performance of their duties and responsibilities to the Company.
No employee shall, except with the prior written approval of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, upon complete disclosure of the facts, have a direct or indirect financial interest in, or receive any compensation or other benefits as a result of, transactions between the Company and any individual or business or firm:
Moreover, employees shall not be employed by or consult for any such business or firm without approval of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. The financial interests mentioned above do not include ownership of equity or debt interests in corporations listed on a national stock exchange or traded over the counter, providing the financial interest is one percent or less of the corporation's outstanding shares. No employee shall accept a directorship of any company or business enterprise without prior approval of the Chief Financial Officer, or in the case of an officer of the Company, prior approval of the Board of Directors.
If any employee or member of the employee's family has or is about to assume an interest or other outside relationship which might result in a conflict of interest, it is the employee's responsibility to immediately provide all the pertinent information to the Chief Financial Officer, who shall report all information to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.
Employees who are unsure whether they are involved in conflict of interest or whether an action might create a conflict of interest should discuss the issue with their manager and/or the Chief Financial Officer.
Corporate Opportunities
Employees are prohibited from taking advantage of opportunities that are discovered through the use of corporate inside information, property or position without the written consent of the Chief Financial Officer. No employee shall for personal or any other person's gain misuse property or information of the Company, or deprive the Company of any opportunity for benefit
 
which could be construed as related to any existing or reasonably anticipated future activity of the Company.
Confidentiality
Advanced Energy invests substantial resources in developing valuable technologies and business processes that are proprietary and confidential to the Company. Advanced Energy protects its intellectual property by obtaining patent, trademark, or trade secret protection and by taking precautions to prevent inappropriate disclosure or loss of confidential information.
Employees have a duty to maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information entrusted to them by the Company, except when disclosure is authorized in the course of approved business relationships by an appropriate officer of the Company or required by laws or regulations. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might result in harm to the Company or its customers if disclosed from any source. Such information includes unpatented technology or know-how, as well as non-technical data such as financial, marketing, strategic, manufacturing, human resource, supplier, customer and material non-public information. In most cases, this duty to protect the confidentiality of Advanced Energy's proprietary information continues even after employment ends.
Advanced Energy also respects the intellectual property of others. Early in product development cycles, Advanced Energy makes reasonable efforts to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others, and where necessary, will pursue an appropriate remedy such as design changes or licenses as may be applicable.
Advanced Energy employees must not accept confidential information from third parties, including competitors and vendors, unless under an agreement approved in advance by Advanced Energy Legal Counsel. In general, confidential information of third parties entrusted to the Company is subject to the same duties of confidentiality as the Company's own confidential information.
Insider Trading
All Advanced Energy employees may at some time have access to information related to Advanced Energy or its business, or to the business of its customers or suppliers, that is not known to the general public and that could affect a person's desire to buy or sell stock. This nonpublic information is often referred to as "inside information." Inside information might appear in written form, such as in memos or e-mails, or might be communicated verbally in meetings or other discussions.
Before buying or selling any stock of the Company or its customers or suppliers, all employees are cautioned to verify that any information they are sharing or acting upon is public information, and not inside information. Buying or selling any stock based upon inside information is illegal. Disclosure of any information to another person, such as a family member or friend, which would enable them to gain a trading benefit not available to the
 
general public, is prohibited as well. Employees of the Company should exercise extreme diligence and caution with respect to trading with inside information as it could subject the employee or the Company to civil liability and criminal penalties. Complete policies relating to the trading of Company stock by employees are contained in the Company's Insider Trading Policy maintained by the Company's Legal Department.
Recordkeeping and Company Property
Every Advanced Energy employee is responsible for ensuring that any business records created by the employee are truthful and accurate, to the best of the employee's knowledge. Employees are expected to exercise caution and diligence to maintain accurate business records and to ensure that entries are made correctly and in accordance with Company policies and procedures. Employees who are responsible for purchasing, billing and payment documents in particular must ensure that no payment made to or by the Company is ever made or approved with the intention or understanding that any part of such payment is to be used for purposes other than those described by the documents supporting the payment. Knowingly creating false or misleading documentation is a serious violation of this Code of Ethical Conduct and could subject the employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
Certain employees are charged with maintaining records that document the Company's observance of legal and ethical business practices, for example, compliance with provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act and laws related to accounting standards, reporting and recordkeeping. Specific duties pertaining to such records are set forth in policies maintained by the Company regarding regulatory compliance and document retention. Any employee having information or knowledge of any improper accounting entries or records, however, shall promptly report such matters to the Chief Financial Officer.
AE's business records, including documents, computer files and similar materials, are the property of the Company and may not be copied or released outside the Company except in the course of performing authorized duties on behalf of AE or with prior approval of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer or the Chief Financial Officer.
Relationships with Customers and Suppliers
Customer and Vendor Relationships
Advanced Energy does not do business with customers or vendors on the basis of gifts or favors. No employee shall furnish services to or seek or receive, for personal or any other person's gain, any improper payment or gratuity from any business enterprise which is a supplier, customer, or competitor of the Company. This prohibition includes receipt of any payment, whether for services or otherwise, personal loan, gift or discount of more than nominal value, or entertainment which goes beyond common courtesies usually associated with accepted business practice, from any business enterprise that has current or known
 
prospective dealings with the Company, except with the prior written approval of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer upon complete disclosure of the facts.
No benefit will be given to a customer or to Advanced Energy with an explicit or implicit requirement to use or purchase products. Discounts, demos, equipment loaners, and warranty services furnished in the ordinary course of business are permitted, provided such benefits comply with local business law.
All employees shall deal fairly with customers, suppliers, competitors and other employees. Observance of generally accepted practices in negotiations and business discussions is to be expected. No employee shall, however, take unfair advantage of anyone through abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair-dealing practice. Each employee is expected to maintain confidentiality with regard to material product information, strategic plans, business issues, development work, and status of negotiations as related to the exchange of information between suppliers and customers. The sharing of this information is prohibited where it can adversely impact the organization.
Gratuities, Donations, Gifts, and Business Courtesies
Any form of a gift that obligates an employee to act in a particular manner with regard to Advanced Energy's business is prohibited, regardless of its value. Any employee dealing with customers, vendors, or other outsiders must avoid excessive or lavish gifts or events that may give the appearance of undue influence. Gifts and entertainment for customers, potential customer's, suppliers and/or local government bureaus or officials must support Advanced Energy's legitimate business interests and should be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. Advanced Energy employees shall also comply with our customers' and suppliers' own rules on receiving gifts and entertainment.
Gifts and entertainment of a commercial or promotional nature are acceptable only if their value does not exceed USD 250.00. Gifts may also be permissible in some countries where customary in the culture and trade, provided that the value of the gift is within these limits and in no way causes Advanced Energy to be obligated. Disclosure to your departmental head is required of any gifts received on a recurring basis. If an employee recipient is not sure of an item's value, the employee should use good care to determine fair market value; and if any question exists about whether the gift is excessive in value, the item should be returned. When unsure about proper conduct, employees should describe the situation to their manager, and if more direction is needed, seek advice from the Chief Financial Officer.
Donations to customers or organizations closely affiliated with customers must be approved by Advanced Energy's Charitable Contributions Committee and comply with the Code of Ethical Conduct.
 
Relationships with our Communities and Society
Compliance with Applicable Laws
Advanced Energy operates on a worldwide basis and is subject to many laws, rules and regulations. The responsibility for compliance with public law is part of every employee's job, and that compliance is an operational component of the Company's daily activities at all sites and for all business units. Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which the Company's ethical standards are built. In conducting the business of the Company, employees shall comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations at all levels of government in every country in which the Company does business. Where there may be a conflict between US law and the laws in other countries, the governing priority will be US law.
Advanced Energy is committed to producing the highest quality products to maintain its customer focus. In fulfilling this commitment, however, the Company will not compromise its compliance with all laws and regulations regarding the safety of our products or standards for our manufacturing facilities.
Adherence to laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, and to the policies in this Code of Ethical Conduct, is a condition of employment for every employee. Violations could expose the employee and Advanced Energy to civil and criminal liability and could harm the Company's reputation and competitive position. Violations may result in disciplinary measures up to and including the termination of employment.
Although the Code of Ethical Conduct provides a framework to guide business conduct, it does not address every situation. Please contact the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Advanced Energy's Legal Counsel if you need assistance in understanding or interpreting these guidelines.
Corporate Communications
Company policies mandate that certain communications about the Company and its business be made only through specific Company officers or departments. For example, questions from financial analysts, investors, or the media should be referred to Investor Relations or to the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer, and inquiries from government agencies should be directed to the Legal Department.
Advanced Energy must be made aware of any inquiries from the government, the financial/analyst community, or the media so that it can properly and thoroughly respond. If an employee is contacted by a representative of the financial community seeking an interview or making a non-routine request, that employee should immediately contact the Chief Financial Officer to ensure appropriate arrangements can be made to comply fully with the Company's legal obligations.
 
Relationships with Fellow Employees
Employee Responsibility
Each AE employee is responsible for adhering to the values and standards set forth in this Code of Ethical Conduct. Consequences for violations of the Code of Ethical Conduct may vary depending upon the severity of the violation, but in some cases may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. It also is the responsibility of every employee to promptly bring known or suspected violations of the Code of Ethical Conduct to the attention of the Company, through Human Resources, or by using the EthicsPoint reporting website/telephone.
EthicsPoint is available to all employees to report conduct believed to be in violation of the C-ode of Conduct through the toll-free number at 1-866-384-4277 or the website . Information transmitted through EthicsPoint will be investigated appropriately and the identity of the source will be maintained in confidence, unless otherwise required by law.
www.EthicsPoint.com
Management Responsibility
All managers shall be responsible for the enforcement of, and compliance with, this Code of Ethical Conduct, including the necessary distribution of this policy to ensure employee knowledge and compliance. Managers are generally required to report willful acts or violations of the Code of Ethical Conduct within 24 hours through either the EthicsPoint website (www.ethicspoint.com), or through escalation reporting to the Internal Audit Department.
Harassment Free Work Environment
Having a professional work environment also means having no tolerance for any form of harassment or violence. Harassment can be verbal, physical or visual behavior where the purpose or effect is to create an offensive, threatening, hostile or intimidating environment. All employees should ensure that they are familiar with and abide by the anti-harassment guidelines and policies issued by Advanced Energy.
Living the Code of Ethical Conduct
The effectiveness of this Code of Ethical Conduct in protecting the Company, along with its shareholders and employees, depends upon every Advanced Energy employee understanding the importance of ethics, fairness and honesty in the performance of their jobs. No code of conduct can ever be all-inclusive or anticipate every ethical question an employee might face. This Code of Ethical Conduct is being provided to express Advanced Energy's philosophy of integrity and ethics, to provide general guidelines for adherence to its principles, and to stimulate employees to think about issues in ethical terms as they perform their jobs.
 
No employee should ever feel vulnerable to retaliation for reporting a violation of this Code of Ethical Conduct. Advanced Energy will not tolerate retaliation against any employee for raising an ethical concern in good faith, meaning a genuine attempt to provide accurate and honest feedback even if the concern later proves to be mistaken. The fact that an employee has raised concerns in good faith, or has provided information in an investigation, cannot be a basis for denial of benefits, termination, demotion, suspension, threats, harassment, or discrimination. Similarly, those who work with employees that raise concerns should continue to treat them in a courteous manner and should not engage in behavior that might alienate or intimidate colleagues. Knowingly making a false accusation, however, or providing false information to the Company in connection with an investigation, could be cause for disciplinary action.
In summary, in your role as an employee of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., recognize that you are capable and empowered to ensure that stakeholders' interests are appropriately balanced, protected and preserved.
I hereby certify that I understand and will adhere to the principles and responsibilities set forth in this Code of Ethical Conduct.

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
Contacts: Annie Leschin / Brooke Deterline StreetSmart Investor Relations
415.775.1788 / ir@aei.com
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2007. Sales were $103.0 million for the second quarter of 2007, a decrease of 1.5% from $104.6 million in the second quarter of 2006, and a sequential decline of 4.0% compared to $107.3 million in the first quarter of 2007.
Fort Collins, Colo., July 25, 2007
Gross margin for the second quarter was 43.6%, up from 42.8% in the second quarter of 2006, and down from 45.0% in the first quarter of 2007 due to lower revenues, and the transition of manufacturing from Stolberg, Germany to China.
Net income for the second quarter of 2007 was $11.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, a 35.7% decrease compared to $18.2 million, or $0.40 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2006. This was primarily due to an increase in research and development spending and the change in the effective tax rate from 11% in 2006 to 35% in 2007. Net income also decreased 8.0% from $12.7 million, or $0.28 in the first quarter of 2007, due to lower revenues. The first quarter of 2007 included a restructuring charge of $2.8 million related to the closure of the Company's Stolberg, Germany facility.
"Second quarter revenues came in at the low end of our guidance as we began to experience the impacts of a decline in our business as demand from the semiconductor capital equipment industry was lower than previously anticipated. As a result, earnings came in lower than expected and gross margins were lower due to the costs associated with the transition of production from Stolberg, Germany to China, which will be complete by the end of the year. We increased our R&D spending in the quarter which was driven by several strategic initiatives that are in process. However, we experienced strong growth from our non-semi business, which was

up 11% sequentially, and dampened the effect of the down semi revenues for the quarter." said Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy. "As we look ahead, we remain highly confident in our growth strategy, including our current product pipeline, our excellent position in our markets and our future growth opportunities."
Third Quarter 2007 Guidance
The Company anticipates third quarter 2007 results to be within the following ranges:

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2007. Sales were $90.5 million for the third quarter of 2007, consistent with the Company's revised guidance given on August 30, 2007. This represented a decrease of 16.0% from $107.7 million in the third quarter of 2006, and a sequential decline of 12.1% compared to $103.0 million in the second quarter of 2007.
Fort Collins, Colo., October 24, 2007
Gross margin for the third quarter was 40.6%, down from 43.7% in the third quarter of 2006, and down from 43.6% in the second quarter of 2007. This was primarily due to lower revenues, an additional charge of $2.2 million to cost of goods sold, and costs related to the transition of manufacturing from Stolberg, Germany to China. The additional charges were related to a change in the estimate of warranty expense for two products, which resulted in a 2.4% reduction in gross margin. The company also incurred a net charge of $1.4 million related to a foreign exchange loss during the quarter, as the Yen and Euro strengthened relative to the US dollar. Net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $5.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $17.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2006, and $11.7 million or $0.25 in the second quarter of 2007.
"Our revenue was in line with our pre announcement due to the weakness in the semiconductor equipment market. The gross margin did not meet our objective due to the increased warranty expense. In the near term we expect to see continued softness in the semiconductor equipment and flat panel display markets with modest growth in our other markets," said Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy. "We made additional progress in the strategic diversification of our business notably with the successful introduction of our Solaron inverter product line."

EXHIBIT 99.1
Financial News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2007. Sales were $83.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, in line with the Company's revised guidance announced on January 22, 2008. This represented a decrease of 19.8% from $104.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2006, and a sequential decline of 7.4% from $90.5 million in the third quarter of 2007, driven primarily by further declines in the semiconductor equipment industry and order delays by key OEMs.
Fort Collins, Colo., February 7, 2008
Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 39.1%, down from 42.9% in the fourth quarter of 2006, and down from 40.6% in the third quarter of 2007, due to lower sales.
Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $4.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to $39.4 million, or $0.87 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006, which includes a tax benefit of $23.5 million related to the reversal of a valuation allowance for deferred taxes. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2006, adjusted to exclude such tax benefit, was $15.9 million or $0.35 per diluted share. Net income from continuing operations also decreased sequentially from $5.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007.
Sales were $384.7 million for 2007, a 6.3% decrease from $410.7 million in 2006. Net income from continuing operations for 2007 was $34.4 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, compared to $87.2 million, or $1.93 per diluted share, in 2006. Net income from continuing operations for
 
Advanced Energy Reports Fourth Quarter 2007 Results - Page 2 February 7. 2008
2006, adjusted to exclude the tax benefit mentioned above, was $63.7 million, or $1.41 per diluted share.
"While 2007 was a challenging year for Advanced Energy, we have seen growth in our solar business including the successful launch of our Solaron inverter product. However, declines in the semiconductor equipment market pressured our sales once again in the fourth quarter," said Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy. "As we move into 2008, we continue to focus on the diversification of our business and are working to drive down our costs, thereby positioning Advanced Energy for growth and profitability."
First Quarter 2008 Guidance
The Company anticipates first quarter 2008 financial results to be within the following ranges:

Advanced Energy Reports Fourth Quarter 2007 Results - Page 3 February 7. 2008
information for each period is a non-GAAP financial measure. Net income from continuing operations, also presented in this press release, is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measures we reference with such comparable GAAP financial measures are included at the end of this press release. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release provide a useful measure of the company's operating results and a meaningful comparison with the company's 2007 operating results. Management and the board of directors of the company utilize these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to evaluate and compare the company's operating performance against internal financial forecasts and budgets, as well as current operating performance. Management and the board of directors, however, do not consider the non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.
The Company's expectations with respect to financial results for the first quarter of 2008 are forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the volatility and cyclicality of the industries the company serves, particularly the semiconductor equipment industry, the timing of orders received from customers, the company's ability to realize cost improvement benefits from the global operations initiatives underway, and unanticipated changes to management's estimates, reserves or allowances. Implementation of the board-authorized repurchase of up to $75 million of the company's stock also may affect the anticipated earnings per share set forth in this press release. These and other risks are described in Advanced Energy's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and statements are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Copies may also be obtained from Advanced Energy's website at www.advanced-energy.com or by contacting Advanced Energy's investor relations at 970-407-6555. Forward looking statements are based on information available to the company on the date of this press release. The company assumes no obligation to update the information in this press release.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2008. Sales were $88.9 million for the quarter, representing a decline of 17.2% from $107.3 million in the first quarter of 2007 and an increase of 6.0% from $83.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Fort Collins, Colo., April 23, 2008
Net income for the first quarter of 2008 was $6.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $12.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2007. However, net income increased sequentially from $4.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007, primarily due to higher revenues and gross profit.
"Strength in our solar equipment and flat panel display markets drove total revenue and EPS above our guided range this quarter. We were pleased with our continued diversification, as we grew our non-semiconductor business 18% sequentially," said Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy. "We implemented cost reductions in G&A during the first quarter that will equate to an estimated $5.5 million in annual savings. This will position us to operate more effectively and profitably in the future."
Second Quarter 2008 Guidance
The Company anticipates the semiconductor market to remain weak through the second quarter 2008 and our results to be within the following ranges:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008. Sales of $88.0 million were driven by a 36% sequential increase in sales to non-semiconductor markets, which reached 48% of our total sales. Sales to the solar market led the way, topping 14% of total sales in the quarter, while service revenues also hit a record high. Total second quarter sales declined 1% versus the first quarter of 2008, and declined 14.6% from $103.0 million in the second quarter of 2007, both due to the continued weakness in the semiconductor capital equipment market. Our book to bill ratio for the quarter was strong at 1.05:1.
Fort Collins, Colo., July 23, 2008
Gross margin for the second quarter was 40.1% versus 43.6% in the second quarter of 2007 due to lower sales and the related overhead absorption. Sequentially, gross margins were fractionally down from 40.3% in the first quarter of 2008.
Net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $5.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, as cost reduction efforts controlled our operating expenses, compared to $11.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007. Net income decreased sequentially from $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2008, but earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2008 were slightly higher due to shares repurchased during the quarter.
"We executed on our diversification strategy, growing non-semiconductor revenue to record levels this quarter. Sales in each of our major non-semiconductor markets demonstrated strong growth, and demand for our products in the solar market reached its highest level yet." said Dr.
 
Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy. "Further, we believe our ability to address these emerging markets will serve us well as we develop new applications for our technology and navigate through this cycle in the semiconductor market."
Third Quarter 2008 Guidance
The Company anticipates third quarter 2008 results to be within the following ranges:

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008. Sales for the third quarter of 2008 were $84.5 million, which represented a 6.6% decline from $90.5 million in the same quarter a year ago and a 4.0% decline from $88.0 million in the second quarter of 2008. The decrease was attributed mainly to weakening global economic conditions and continued challenges in the semiconductor capital equipment market. Our book to bill ratio for the quarter was 0.92:01, with an ending backlog of $48.9 million.
Fort Collins, Colo., October 22, 2008
Despite the overall decline in revenue, sales to non-semiconductor markets grew 11% sequentially to 48% of total sales for the quarter. Non-semiconductor performance was driven by sales to the solar market, which represented 23% of total revenue, and sales to the flat panel display market, which were also strong at 11% of total sales. Service sales grew to 18% of total revenue, as customers evaluated the benefits of making near-term investments versus extending the life of their existing equipment with upgrades and maintenance during these challenging economic times.
Gross margin for the third quarter was 41.7%, up from 40.6% in the third quarter of 2007, and 40.1% in the second quarter of 2008, due principally to a more favorable product mix.
Net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $5.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to $5.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007. Net income also decreased sequentially from $5.9 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008.
 
"Sales to the solar market reached their highest levels yet, and were once again key to the success of our quarterly results, aided by strength in sales to the flat panel display market and our service business. We continued to build out our non-semiconductor businesses with new products such as our recently announced 500KW Solaron inverter. The expansion of this product portfolio will allow us to penetrate larger inverter installations, including utilities and solar farms. Overall, we were pleased with our performance in the third quarter, especially in light of the particularly challenging economic environment," said Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy. " Unfortunately, the distressed economic conditions are impacting all markets and have led us to guide lower revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter. We will, however, take important steps to manage costs in order to maintain a healthy business, while investing in key products and markets to position the company for future opportunities."
Fourth Quarter 2008 Guidance
The Company anticipates fourth quarter 2008 results to be within the following ranges:

The actions are being taken to both further reduce costs of operations and to streamline the organization going forward.
The Company will reduce approximately 7 percent of its global workforce through reductions-in-force and begin implementation of the restructuring actions this quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (NasdaqGM: AEIS) announced today that, in order to better align its cost structure with current market conditions, the company will reduce its global workforce by approximately 114 people or 7 percent of its total workforce. This reduction will be across all functional areas and geographies; however the company remains committed to its product development strategy and remains focused on investing in key market opportunities. The company is also taking this opportunity to reconfirm its revenue guidance of $66 to $72 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., December 11, 2008
Coupled with the workforce reductions that were implemented during the first three quarters, this realignment brings the total reduction to 185 employees during 2008. This is one of many cost-saving measures the company is implementing in the fourth quarter and the first half of 2009. Others include a 10% pay cut for all executives and a 10% reduction in Board of Directors fees, minimizing discretionary spending, consolidating of certain sales and service offices, and driving efficiencies throughout the organization including in its manufacturing processes. The workforce reduction will result in restructuring charges of approximately $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, approximately $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2009 and approximately $300,000 for the second quarter of 2009, consisting of severance costs and related
 
expenses. The actions taken today are expected to amount to annual cost savings of approximately $10 million. The overall cost reductions taken during 2008 and targeted for 2009 are expected to amount to annual cost savings of approximately $25 million.
Given the current market conditions and changing customer demand, Advanced Energy has also reviewed its end of life product and inventory strategies and its excess and obsolete inventory reserve policies. As a result, the company will record a charge of approximately $3.5 million to cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of 2008.
"Advanced Energy is taking proactive steps to manage its cost structure, streamline operations and improve efficiencies during these challenging times. These short and long term cost-cutting actions are expected to lower our quarterly break-even point to approximately $65 million by the end of the second quarter of 2009. Despite the reduction in our workforce, we remain committed to investing in key new products that have the greatest potential in our markets. These actions will position us to capitalize on our opportunities when the markets and economy begin to recover," said Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer of Advanced Energy. "These are unfortunate circumstances and challenging market conditions, and we would like to thank our employees for their service and dedication to Advanced Energy."

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $67.5 million, representing a 19.5% decline from $83.8 million in the same quarter a year ago and a 20.1% decline from $84.5 million in the third quarter of 2008. The weak economy affected all of our markets, led by semiconductor equipment, which experienced a revenue decrease of 20.2% sequentially. Our book to bill ratio for the quarter was 0.7:1.
Fort Collins, Colo., February 23, 2009
Sales to our non-semiconductor markets represented 48.3% of total sales for the quarter, driven by continued strength from the solar market, which represented 23.6% of total sales. Service revenues were 18.4% of total sales, down 20.5% sequentially, primarily due to softness in the semiconductor market, where the majority of our installed base resides.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 27.2%, down from 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007, and 41.7% in the third quarter of 2008. Margins were lower due to a $5.1 million charge to cost of goods sold for excess and obsolete inventory, which impacted gross margin by 7.6%, as well as lower revenues and the resulting lower absorption of manufacturing overhead.
We reduced operating expenses 15.7% sequentially in the quarter, as we implemented additional cost reduction measures including discretionary spending controls, global shutdown weeks during the holiday season and workforce reductions.
 
During the fourth quarter of 2008, we also recorded a non-cash charge of $18.0 million, or $0.43 per share, for income taxes related to a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. This resulted in a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 of $19.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007. Net income also decreased sequentially from $5.4 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008.
For the full year 2008, sales were $328.9 million, a 14.5% decrease from $384.7 million in 2007. The primary driver of the reduction in sales was a 39.0% drop in revenues to the semiconductor equipment market, partially offset by a 118.7% increase in revenues to the solar market. Net loss from continuing operations for 2008 was $1.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $34.4 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, in 2007. During 2008, we generated $24.7 million in cash from operations to end the year with $180.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, including auction rate securities of $30.4 million.
"In 2008, non-semiconductor revenue grew faster and became a larger part of total revenue. In an otherwise difficult environment during the year, our strategy of targeting a diverse group of markets for our leading power conversion technology proved to be effective," said Hans Betz, president and CEO. "Though overall revenues declined year-over-year, we doubled our solar revenue, grew our services business and introduced successful new products such as the Solaron 500KW inverter, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet with a strong cash position. As the year ended with extremely challenging economic conditions across all industries and very limited visibility, we took quick, decisive action to implement major cost reductions.
Going forward, we continue to see a weak economic outlook that may persist for some time. We will take additional cost reduction measures in the future as needed to drive our breakeven point even lower and address further deterioration in our markets. We remain focused on our core market and technology initiatives to ensure Advanced Energy is well positioned to take market share during the downturn and is poised for tremendous leverage when our markets recover."
First Quarter 2009 Guidance
The Company anticipates first quarter 2009 results to be within the following ranges:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (NasdaqGM: AEIS) announced today a reduction in workforce and other cost reductions, as we indicated on our fourth quarter 2008 earnings call. In response to the deteriorating economic conditions and weakening demand from the company's end markets, the company is reducing its global workforce by approximately 330 people or 22% of total headcount across all functional areas and geographies and lowering the salaries of management and executive officers by an additional 5%, totaling 15% overall, effective April 1, 2009. "While we were hopeful that conditions would begin to stabilize, the markets we serve have nonetheless continued to deteriorate," said Dr. Hans Betz, president and chief executive officer. "This has led us to take additional cost reduction measures in order to streamline our operations, and enable us to continue to focus on key market opportunities."
FORT COLLINS, Colo., March 12, 2009
These cost reductions are expected to reduce salary costs by approximately $8.2 million annually. Today's measures along with other discretionary spending reductions, will result in approximately $21 million of savings over the next three quarters, and will lower the company's breakeven point to $55 million by the end of the second quarter of 2009. Total restructuring charges, including those from cost reductions announced in December, will be approximately $3.8 million in the first quarter of 2009 and approximately $800,000 in the second quarter of 2009.

Financial News Release                     
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009. Sales for the first quarter of 2009 were $32.6 million, representing a 63.3% decline from $88.9 million in the same quarter a year ago and a 51.7% decline from $67.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Sales were lower across all of the Company's markets, as the global financial crisis reduced consumer and commercial spending, resulting in limited capital expansion in our markets. Our book to bill ratio for the quarter increased sequentially to 0.87:1, from quarter's 0.70:1, from the fourth quarter of 2008, though on a much lower revenue base.
Fort Collins, Colo., April 23, 2009
Our gross margins in the first quarter were impacted by the lower revenues, resulting in lower absorption of manufacturing overhead in the first quarter. Margins fell to 19.6%, down from 40.3% in the first quarter of 2008 and 27.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008.
During the quarter we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in a charge of $3.4 million or $0.08 per share related to a reduction in workforce. Due to the current economic downturn and a significant decline in the Company's market capitalization, we recorded an estimated non-cash impairment charge in the first quarter of $63.3 million or $1.51 per share related to our goodwill. This charge does not affect our cash balance, liquidity, or operating cash flow.
The result was a net loss for the first quarter of 2009 of $79.8 million, or $1.90 loss per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.0 million, or $0.13 earnings per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008. The quarterly net loss increased from $19.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share,
 
in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our balance sheet remained strong as we closed the quarter with $173.4 million of cash and investments.
"This was an exceptionally difficult quarter as we experienced revenue levels not seen since the late 1990s. We responded once again by reducing our cost structure, yet maintaining our critical technology development and product initiatives. Our healthy balance sheet remains a key strategic asset, which we plan to leverage during these difficult times," said Hans Betz, president and CEO. "Although we experienced a significant drop in all of our markets during the quarter and visibility remains limited, we have seen some positive signs of investment in some markets, which we hope will provide some near-term stability. We remain committed to our strategy of being the strong and healthy supplier of choice to all of our OEM and end user customers."
Second Quarter 2009 Guidance
The Company anticipates second quarter 2009 results to be within the following ranges:

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     On May 28, 2009, Douglas S. Schatz, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the "Company"), and his wife Jill E. Schatz, as trustees of The Douglas S. Schatz and Jill E. Schatz Family Trust U/A DTD 3/26/02 (the "Trust") adopted a selling plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Plan") which provides for the sale of up to 1,692,308 shares of common stock of the Company. Shares will be sold under the Plan on the open market at prevailing market prices and subject to minimum price thresholds specified in the Plan. The Plan was established as part of Mr. and Mrs. Schatz's personal long term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity. Rule 10b5-1 permits officers and directors of public companies to adopt pre-determined plans for buying or selling specified amounts of stock if the plan is adopted at a time when the purchaser or seller is not aware of any material non-public information. On May 8, 2009, the Trust entered into a series of variable prepaid forward contracts (the "VPF Contracts") with a securities broker, in order to monetize 1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Upon fulfillment of each of 6 orders under the VPF Contracts, the Trust received a cash payment equal to approximately 84% of the market value of the shares subject to such order and pledged such shares to the securities broker. Pending settlement of such contracts, between May 11, 2010 and December 13, 2010, the Trust will retain all of its voting rights in respect of the pledged shares. The Trust has filed Forms 4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to report the placement of orders under the VPF Contracts.
     The Company does not undertake to report Rule 10b5-1 plans or any other stock transactions that may be adopted or effected by any officer or director, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced trading plan or transaction, except to the extent required by law.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
Advanced Energy Industries, Inc ("we", "us", "our", or the "Company") entered into a Credit Line Account Agreement (the "Credit Line Agreement") with UBS Bank USA ("UBS Bank") dated as of April 30, 2009 that became effective on June 2, 2009 upon the receipt of signature pages from UBS Bank. The Credit Line Agreement provides us with an uncommitted, demand revolving line of credit (an intended "no net cost loan") of $21.0 million, as determined by UBS Bank in its sole discretion, that is secured by our auction rate securities that we have pledged as collateral.
UBS Bank may, upon our request, make one or more advances to us. The interest expense that we pay on the no net cost loan is not expected to exceed the interest income that we receive on the auction rate securities that we have pledged to UBS Bank as security for the no net cost loan and which reside in our collateral account. If the payments on our auction rate securities are not sufficient to pay the accrued interest on such advances before a due date, UBS Bank may, in its sole discretion (1) capitalize unpaid interest as an additional advance or (2) require us to make payment of all accrued and unpaid interest. UBS Bank may demand full or partial payment of the no net cost loan, at its sole option and without cause, at any time. UBS Bank may, at any time, in its discretion, terminate and cancel the no net cost loan. If at any time UBS Bank exercises its right of demand under certain sections of the Credit Line Agreement, then UBS Financial Services Inc. or one of its affiliates shall provide, as soon as reasonably possible, alternative financing on substantially the same terms and conditions as those under the Credit Line Agreement and UBS Bank agrees that the Credit Line Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until such time as such alternative financing has been established.
The above mentioned summary of the Credit Line Agreement is described in its entirety by the copies of the Credit Line Agreement, the Addendum to Credit Line Account Application and Agreement, the Addendum to Credit Line Agreement, and the Important Notice on Interest Rates and Payments attached hereto respectively as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

NOTICE TO CO-SIGNER (Traduccion en Ingles Se Requiere Por La Ley)
You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before you do. If the borrower doesn't pay the debt, you will have to. Be sure you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you want to accept this responsibility.
You may have to pay to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may also have to pay late fees or collection costs, which increase this amount.
The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower. The creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower, such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in default, that fact may become a part of your credit record.
This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.
AVISO PARA EL FIADOR (Spanish Translation Required By Law)
Se le esta pidiendo que garantice esta deuda. Pienselo con cuidado antes de ponerse de acuerdo. Si la persona que ha pedido este prestamo no paga la deuda, usted tendra que pagarla. Este seguro de que usted podra pagar si sea obligado a pagarla y de que usted desea aceptar la responsabilidad.
Si la persona que ha pedido el prestamo no paga la deuda, es posible que usted tenga que pagar la suma total de la deuda, mas los cargos por tardarse en el pago o el costo de cobranza, lo cual aumenta el total de esta suma.
El acreedor (financiero) puede cobrarle a usted sin, primeramente, tratar de cobrarle al deudor. Los mismos metodos de cobranza que pueden usarse contra el deudor, podran usarse contra usted, tales como presentar una demanda en corte, quitar parte de su sueldo, etc. Si alguna vez no se cumpla con la obligacion de pagar esta deuda, se puede incluir esa informacion en la historia de credito de usted.
Este aviso no es el contrato mismo en que se le echa a usted la responsabilidad de la deuda.

Re: Account Number EI-05686 (the "Account")
ADDENDUM TO CREDIT LINE AGREEMENT
The attached "Credit Line Agreement" sets forth certain terms related to the extension of credit by UBS Bank USA ("The "Bank") with respect to certain assets held through the above-referenced non-discretionary corporate cash management Account with UBS Financial Services Inc. (the "Firm"). The party signing this Addendum as Client where indicated below (the "Client") understands and agrees that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in either the Credit Line Agreement (including without limitation Section 19 of the Credit Line Agreement) or the existing Corporate Cash Management Account Agreement applicable to the Account, as amended from time to time (the "Account Agreement"), the terms of the Credit Line Agreement supplement, but do not replace, the existing Account Agreement as follows: (i) the terms of the Credit Line Agreement (as amended from time to time, in accordance with its terms) shall govern with respect to any matters, issues or disputes related directly to, or arising directly from, the extension of credit and/or the status of Client as borrower and the Bank as lender pursuant to the Credit Line Agreement (e.g., matters relating to the loan account(s) established at the Bank pursuant to the Credit Line Agreement, and/or the indemnification of the Bank as a lender); and (ii) the terms of the Account Agreement (as amended from time to time, in accordance with its terms) shall govern with respect to all other matters (e.g., matters relating to the Account established at the Firm pursuant to the Account Agreement, the Firm's trading authority and activities and/or the indemnification of the Firm for the services it provides under the Account Agreement).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Client further understands and agrees that:
(A) If applicable, Client may continue to receive Financial Advisor Reports with respect to the Account, from its Financial Advisor that are in addition to the official monthly statements that the Firm provides ("Financial Advisor Reports"). As noted in the disclaimer page for those Financial Advisor Reports, the Financial Advisor Reports are for informational purposes only and Client should rely on the Firm's monthly account statements and trade confirmations as the official records relative to the Account. There may be differences between the Financial Advisor Reports and the Firm's monthly statements and trade confirmations. The disclaimer page of the Financial Advisor Reports sets forth important terms and conditions applicable to the Financial Advisor Reports. Client's receipt of Financial Advisor Reports constitutes Client's agreement to, and acceptance of, those terms and conditions.
(B) Solely with respect to disputes arising out of the extension of credit and/or the status of Client as borrower and the Bank as lender pursuant to the Credit Line Agreement, the choice of law provisions of Paragraph 13 of the Credit Line Agreement and the dispute resolution provisions of Section 17 of the Credit Line Agreement shall govern. With respect to any other disputes relating to the Account, the terms of the Account Agreement regarding choice of law and the arbitration of disputes shall continue to govern.
(C) If Client elected or in the future elects to adopt the Firm's "Addendum Granting Limited Authority to Invest in Money Market Funds For Non-Discretionary Corporate Cash Management Accounts," the Firm may continue to exercise the limited discretion described therein with respect to the Account.
(D) If Client elected or in the future elects to adopt the "Investment Policy Submission Addendum For Non-Discretionary Corporate Cash Management Accounts," the terms set forth therein shall continue to govern with respect to the Account and any investment policy statement associated with the Account.

Exhibit 10.4
 KM 
This document contains important information regarding the interest rate and interest payments on your Credit Line. You should carefully review this Notice and your Credit Line Application and Agreement, including the Addendum, (the "Agreement") and speak to your Financial Advisor regarding any questions or concerns you may have with your Agreement. Defined terms used in this Notice have the respective meanings set forth in the Agreement unless defined in this Notice.
The Agreement provides you with a "no net cost" Credit Line. This means that the interest that you pay on the Credit Line Obligations will not exceed the interest that you receive on the Auction Rate Securities that you have pledged to the Bank as security for the Credit Line and which are held in the Collateral Account. Although you may be able to capitalize interest you will not be charged interest on interest.
The Credit Line statements that you receive from the Bank while the Credit Line is outstanding are for information purposes only. The interest charge(s) on these statements are approximations due to timing and systems limitations. You will receive a final confirmation from the Bank of the interest charged on the Credit Line. This does not change the " no net cost" nature of the Credit Line.
If you have Taxable Student Loan Auction Rate Securities pledged as Collateral you may not receive an interest payment in months in which you are charged interest on the Credit Line. Certain taxable student loan ARS made high interest rate payments to UBSFS investors for several months during the first half of 2008, and then ceased making interest payments in subsequent months. These taxable student loan ARS will not make any further interest payments until a future date determined in accordance with the terms of the Auction Rate Securities. For the purpose of determining loan interest payments for loans against these Taxable Student Loan Auction Rate Securities, the high interest payments will be taken into consideration (and the interest rate annualized). For example, you will be charged (i) for the period from the date of the Addendum through and including January 21, 2009, the applicable coupon rate(s) on the Taxable Student Loan Auction Rate Securities and (ii) from January 22, 2009 and thereafter you will be charged that average annualized rate (e.g., T-bills plus 120 basis points), for each month in which your loan is outstanding, including months for which the annualized interest was paid in a prior month and for which no additional or current payment is being made to you.
Interest on the Credit Line accrues daily and is charged in accordance with the Bank's regular interest billing cycle. The Bank's billing cycle may not be the same as the cycle on which the Auction Rate Securities pay interest.
Please acknowledge your receipt and review of this Notice by signing below.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009.
Fort Collins, Colo., July 23, 2009
Sales for the second quarter of 2009 were $35.6 million, a 9.2% increase from $32.6 million in the first quarter of 2009. Sales decreased 59.6% from $88.0 million in the second quarter of 2008.
Sales to the semiconductor market drove overall sales growth, increasing 27.3% sequentially to $12.2 million. Semiconductor equipment OEMs worked through their inventories and fabs increased utilization, reflecting what we believe is the beginning of the market recovery. With equipment sitting idle for the last few quarters, manufacturers' need for repairs and upgrades also grew, leading to a sequential increase of 14.2% in service and support revenues to $8.8 million, taking them to 24.8% of total sales. Sales to our non-semiconductor markets fell 5.0% to $14.6 million and represented 41.0% of total sales for the quarter. Strong orders during the quarter drove a sequential increase in our book to bill ratio to 1.06:1 from 0.87:1 in the first quarter of 2009 on a higher revenue base.
Higher revenues and the cost reduction efforts that have been implemented over the last several quarters resulted in improved gross margins of 22.3% in the second quarter, up from 19.6% in the first quarter of 2009. Gross margins decreased from 40.1% in the second quarter of 2008.
The second quarter net loss was $16.0 million or $0.38 loss per share, up from a net loss of $79.8 million or $1.90 loss per share in the first quarter of 2009, which included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $63.3 million or $1.51 loss per share. Net income was $5.9 million or $0.14 earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2008.
 
"We were pleased with the improvement in our second quarter results, which we believe points to signs of modest recovery in certain markets. For the first time in more than a year, sales to our semiconductor OEMs increased. Sales to our semi-related service business also grew, typically reflecting near-term modest growth in the semiconductor market," said Hans Betz, president and CEO.
"Our strong commitment to technology investment is fueling our diversification strategy. As such, we are very encouraged by the order momentum for our 500KW Solaron inverter. The successful launch of the 500KW Solaron demonstrates AE's commitment to technology development as we look to expand our product portfolio and our market presence."
Third Quarter 2009 Guidance
The Company anticipates third quarter 2009 results to be within the following ranges:

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2009.
Fort Collins, Colo., October 28, 2009
Sales for the third quarter of 2009 increased 45.5% to $51.8 million from $35.6 million in the second quarter of 2009, and decreased 38.8% from $84.5 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Growth in several markets drove the increased revenues in the third quarter. The primary drivers were sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market, which rose 70.7% sequentially to $20.8 million, representing 40.2% of total sales for the quarter, and sales to the non-semiconductor markets, which increased 39.2% sequentially to $20.3 million, representing 39.2% of total sales for the quarter. Service sales were also strong at $10.7 million or 20.6% of total sales for the quarter. Our book to bill ratio for the third quarter was 1.16:1 up from 1.06:1 in the second quarter of 2009 which drove a 32.1% sequential increase in our backlog to $34.6 million at the end of the third quarter compared to $26.2 million at the end of the second quarter.
Our gross margin was 30.1% in the third quarter, up from 22.3% in the second quarter of 2009, and down from 41.7% for the third quarter of 2008. The sequential improvement was driven by product mix increased revenue as well as continued cost controls.
The third quarter net loss was $8.4 million or $0.20 loss per share, compared to a net loss of $16.0 million or $0.38 loss per share in the second quarter of 2009. In the third quarter of 2008, net income was $5.4 million or $0.13 earnings per diluted share.
 
We ended the quarter with $177.3 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities; a $2.0 million increase sequentially.
"Our strong sales performance in the third quarter was driven by the continued recovery in the semiconductor market as factory utilization at chip manufacturers rose, driving orders for new equipment. The majority of our non-semi markets also grew, reflecting improvement in the broader economy over the first half of the year." said Hans Betz, president and CEO.
"The Solaron inverter took the spotlight once again this quarter, as our market penetration deepened, reflected by increased bookings and backlog. We increased our production capacity for inverters as our order volume outstripped our capacity in the third quarter. We also expanded the Solaron product family in the quarter with the introduction of our European 500KW inverter and today's announcement of the Solaron 250KW inverter, addressing expanding another portion of the commercial solar market."

The Company anticipates fourth quarter 2009 results to be within the following ranges:

On December 8, 2009, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. ("Advanced Energy") entered into an Indemnification Agreement (each, a "Director Indemnification Agreement") with each of its current directors other than Hans Betz who is also an executive officer of Advanced Energy. The directors who entered into a Director Indemnification Agreement are Douglas Schatz, Frederick Ball, Richard Beck, Trung Doan, Edward Grady, Thomas Rohrs and Elwood Spedden (each, a "Covered Director"). Mr. Schatz beneficially owns approximately 17% of Advanced Energy's outstanding common stock as of December 8, 2009.
Each Director Indemnification Agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to exceptions specified in the Director Indemnification Agreement, Advanced Energy shall hold harmless and indemnify the Covered Director, and advance expenses incurred by the Covered Director, including reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, in connection with any proceeding covered by the Director Indemnification Agreement. Advanced Energy's obligations under each Director Indemnification Agreement shall continue following the time that the Covered Director ceases to be a director of Advanced Energy, so long as the Covered Director is subject to any proceeding covered by the Director Indemnification Agreement.
The rights of indemnification provided by the Director Indemnification Agreement are not exclusive and specifically supplement the rights to indemnification provided to the directors in Advanced Energy's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and applicable law. To the extent that Advanced Energy maintains one or more insurance policies providing liability insurance for its directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries, the Covered Directors shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with the terms thereof. In the event of any payment by Advanced Energy under a Director Indemnification Agreement, Advanced Energy shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Covered Director.
The foregoing description of the Director Indemnification Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the Director Indemnification Agreements, the form of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
The Director Indemnification Agreements described in Item 1.01 above supersede, as of December 8, 2009, the prior indemnification agreements to which Advanced Energy and the Covered Directors were parties. Such prior indemnification agreements are in the form of Exhibit 99.1 hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference.
On December 8, 2009, the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy approved the appointment of Yuval Wasserman as Advanced Energy's President and Chief Operating Officer, effective January 1, 2010. Mr. Wasserman, age 55, currently is Advanced Energy's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, a position he has held since April 2009. Mr. Wasserman joined Advanced Energy in August 2007 as Senior Vice President, Sales, Marketing and Service, and was promoted in October 2007 to Executive Vice President, Sales, Marketing and Service. Prior to joining Advanced Energy, Mr. Wasserman served as the president and chief executive officer of Tevet Process Control Technologies, Inc. from May 2002 to July 2007. Mr. Wasserman also has held senior executive and general management positions at Boxer Cross (a metrology company acquired by Applied Materials, Inc.), Fusion Systems (a semiconductor equipment company that had been a division of Axcelis Technologies, Inc.), AG Associates (a semiconductor equipment company) and National Semiconductor (a semiconductor manufacturer). No changes to Mr. Wasserman's compensation or benefits were approved, nor were any options or restricted stock units granted, in connection with his appointment as President and Chief Operating Officer, but the Board of Directors has delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors review of Mr. Wasserman's 2010 compensation.
Effective upon Mr. Wasserman's appointment as President and Chief Operating Officer, his annual base salary will be increased to $374,000 and his target bonus under Advanced Energy's Leadership Corporate Incentive Plan will be equal to 70% of his annual base salary. Mr. Wasserman is eligible for a bonus under the Leadership Corporate Incentive Plan only if specified corporate performance thresholds with respect to annual revenue and operating income are met, and the amount of his bonus (if any), which may be greater or less than his target bonus, will be based upon his performance review and accomplishment of individual performance objectives determined by management, subject to consideration of the total size of the bonus pool for all executive officers and employees and the limitation that no participant in the Leadership Corporate Incentive Plan may receive a bonus greater than 150% of such participant's target bonus. The individual performance objectives applicable to Mr. Wasserman and all participants in the Leadership Corporate Incentive Plan relate to profitability, growth, quality and other key metrics set forth in Advanced Energy's annual operating plan that is approved annually by the Board of Directors.
 
On December 8, 2009, the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy adopted the Second Amendment to the By-Laws of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the "Amendment"), effective immediately. The principal changes effected by the Amendment are as follows:

EXHIBIT 10.1
               THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT (the "") is made and entered into as of December 8, 2009 between Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.a Delaware corporation (the ""), and ("").
Agreement
,
Company
                    
Indemnitee
          WHEREAS, highly competent persons have become more reluctant to serve publicly held corporations as directors, officers, or in other capacities unless they are provided with adequate protection through insurance or adequate indemnification against inordinate risks of claims and actions against them arising out of their service to and activities on behalf of the corporation;
          WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "") has determined that, in order to attract and retain qualified individuals, the Company will attempt to maintain on an ongoing basis, at its sole expense, liability insurance to protect persons serving the Company and its subsidiaries from certain liabilities. Although the furnishing of such insurance has been a customary and widespread practice among U.S.-based corporations and other business enterprises, the Company believes that, given current market conditions and trends, such insurance may be available to it in the future only at higher premiums and with more exclusions. At the same time, directors, officers, and other persons in service to corporations or business enterprises are being increasingly subjected to expensive and time-consuming litigation relating to, among other things, matters that traditionally would have been brought only against the Company or business enterprise itself. The Amended Bylaws (the "") and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "") of the Company require indemnification of the officers and directors of the Company. Indemnitee may also be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (""). The Bylaws, the Certificate, and the DGCL expressly provide that the indemnification provisions set forth therein are not exclusive, and thereby contemplate that contracts may be entered into between the Company and members of the Board, officers, and other persons with respect to indemnification;
Board
Bylaws
Certificate
DGCL
          WHEREAS, the uncertainties relating to such insurance and to indemnification have increased the difficulty of attracting and retaining such persons;
          WHEREAS, the Board has determined that the increased difficulty in attracting and retaining such persons is detrimental to the best interests of the Company's stockholders and that the Company should act to assure such persons that there will be increased certainty of such protection in the future;
          WHEREAS, it is reasonable, prudent, and necessary for the Company contractually to obligate itself to indemnify, and to advance expenses on behalf of, such persons to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law so that they will serve or continue to serve the Company free from undue concern that they will not be so indemnified;
          WHEREAS, this Agreement is a supplement to and in furtherance of the Bylaws and the Certificate and any resolutions adopted pursuant thereto, and shall not be deemed a substitute therefor, nor to diminish or abrogate any rights of Indemnitee thereunder;
          WHEREAS, Indemnitee does not regard the protection available under the Bylaws, the Certificate, and insurance as adequate in the present circumstances, and may not be willing to serve as a director without adequate protection, and the Company desires Indemnitee to serve in such capacity. Indemnitee is willing to serve, continue to serve, and to take on additional service for or on behalf of the Company on the condition that he be so indemnified; and
          WHEREAS, the Company and the Indemnitee intend for this Agreement to replace the prior Indemnification Agreement entered into between the two parties.
 
          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of Indemnitee's agreement to serve and/or continue to serve as a director after the date hereof, the parties hereto agree as follows:
               1. . Indemnitee agrees to serve and/or continue to serve as a director of the Company. Indemnitee may at any time and for any reason resign from such position (subject to any other contractual obligation or any obligation imposed by operation of law), in which event the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to continue Indemnitee in such position. This Agreement shall not be deemed an employment contract between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries or any Enterprise (as hereinafter defined)) and Indemnitee. Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that Indemnitee's position with the Company is at will, and Indemnitee may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, subject to the Bylaws, the Certificate, and the DGCL. The foregoing notwithstanding, this Agreement shall continue in force after Indemnitee has ceased to serve as a director of the Company.
Services to the Company
               2. . The Company hereby agrees to hold harmless and indemnify Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law, as such may be amended from time to time. In furtherance of the foregoing indemnification, and without limiting the generality thereof:
Indemnity of Indemnitee
                    (a) . Indemnitee shall be entitled to the rights of indemnification provided in this if, by reason of Indemnitee's Corporate Status (as hereinafter defined), Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be made, a party to or participant in any Proceeding (as hereinafter defined) other than a Proceeding by or in the right of the Company. Pursuant to this , Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses (as hereinafter defined), judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee, or on Indemnitee's behalf, in connection with such Proceeding or any claim, issue, or matter therein, if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company, and with respect to any criminal Proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.
Proceedings Other Than Proceedings by or in the Right of the Company

The relative fault of the Company and all officers, directors, or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who are jointly liable with Indemnitee (or would be if joined in such Proceeding), on the one hand, and Indemnitee, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, the degree to which their actions were motivated by intent to gain personal profit or advantage, the degree to which their liability is primary or secondary, and the degree to which their conduct is active or passive.
                    (c) The Company hereby agrees to fully indemnify and hold Indemnitee harmless from any claims of contribution which may be brought by officers, directors, or employees of the Company, other than Indemnitee, who may be jointly liable with Indemnitee.

Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the Expenses incurred by Indemnitee and shall include or be preceded or accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay any Expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against such Expenses. Advances shall include any and all reasonable Expenses incurred pursuing an action to enforce this right of advancement. Any advances and undertakings to repay pursuant to this shall be unsecured and interest free. This shall not apply to any claim made by Indemnitee for which indemnity is excluded pursuant to .

Section 9
               6. . It is the intent of this Agreement to secure for Indemnitee rights of indemnity that are as favorable as may be permitted under the DGCL and public policy of the State of Delaware. Accordingly, the parties agree that the following procedures and presumptions shall apply in the event of any question as to whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement:
Procedures and Presumptions for Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification
                    (a) To obtain indemnification under this Agreement, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request for indemnification or advancement of Expenses, including therein or therewith such documentation and information as is reasonably available to Indemnitee and is reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, as soon as is reasonably practicable following the receipt by Indemnitee of written notice thereof. Such written request to the Company shall include a description of the nature of the Proceeding and the facts underlying such Proceeding. The omission by Indemnitee to notify the Company hereunder will not relieve the Company from any liability that it may have to Indemnitee hereunder or otherwise than under this Agreement, and any delay in so notifying the Company shall not constitute a waiver by Indemnitee of any rights under this Agreement. The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of such a request for indemnification, advise the Board in writing that Indemnitee has requested indemnification.
                    (b) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to hereof, a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case by one of the following four (4) methods, which shall be at the election of the Board: (1) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, (2) by a committee comprised of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, (3) if there are no Disinterested Directors or if the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel (as hereinafter defined) in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, or (4) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that if a Change in Control shall have occurred, such determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification hereunder shall be made by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee.
Section 6(a)
                    (c) If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel pursuant to hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as provided in this . If a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Board shall give written notice to Indemnitee of the identity of such Independent Counsel. If a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall
Section 6(b)
Section 6(c)
 
be selected by Indemnitee (unless Indemnitee shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply) and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company of the identity of such Independent Counsel. In either event, the Company or Indemnitee, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to Indenitee or the Company, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "" as defined in of this Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If a written objection is made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or other court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by Indemnitee or the Company to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the court or by such other person as the court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under hereof. The Company shall pay any and all reasonable fees and expenses of Independent Counsel incurred by such Independent Counsel in connection with acting pursuant to hereof, and the Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses incident to the procedures of this , regardless of the manner in which such Independent Counsel was selected or appointed. Upon the commencement of any Proceeding or arbitration pursuant to hereof, the Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).

Section 6(c)
Section 7(a)
                    (d) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with this Agreement. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption, including the Company, shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law. Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
                    (e) Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise, including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Enterprise. In addition, the knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent, or employee of the Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this Agreement. Whether or not the foregoing provisions of this are satisfied, it shall in any event be presumed that Indemnitee has at all times acted in good faith and in a manner Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.
Section 6(e)
                    (f) If the person, persons, or entity empowered or selected under this to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within sixty (60) days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall
Section 6
 
be entitled to such indemnification absent (i) a misstatement by Indemnitee of a material fact, or an omission of a material fact necessary to make Indemnitee's statement not materially misleading, in connection with the request for indemnification, or (ii) a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, however, that such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days, if the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time to obtain or evaluate documentation and/or information relating thereto; and provided, further, that the foregoing provisions of this shall not apply (1) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to of this Agreement and if (A) within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination, the Board or the Disinterested Directors, if appropriate, resolve to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within seventy-five (75) days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of stockholders is called within fifteen (15) days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within sixty (60) days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (2) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the Independent Counsel.
Section 6(f)
Section 6(b)
                    (g) Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons, or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons, or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information that is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and that is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any Independent Counsel, member of the Board or stockholder of the Company shall act reasonably and in good faith in making a determination regarding Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement. Any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons, or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification), and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
                    (h) The Company acknowledges that a settlement or other disposition short of final judgment may be successful if it permits a party to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption, and uncertainty. In the event that any action, claim, or proceeding to which Indemnitee is a party is resolved in any manner other than by adverse judgment against Indemnitee (including, without limitation, settlement of such action, claim, or proceeding with or without payment of money or other consideration) it shall be presumed that Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in such Proceeding. Anyone seeking to overcome this presumption shall have the burden of proof and the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence.
                    (i) The termination of any Proceeding or of any claim, issue, or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement) of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that Indemnitee's conduct was unlawful.

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release     
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009.
Fort Collins, Colo., February 16, 2010
Sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 28.4% to $66.4 million from $51.8 million in the third quarter of 2009, and decreased 1.6% from $67.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Sales to the semiconductor capital equipment markets rose 58.2% sequentially to $32.9 million, representing 49.6% of total sales for the quarter. Sales to the non-semiconductor markets grew 8.6% sequentially to $22.0 million, representing 33.2% of total sales for the quarter. Service revenue also continued strong, increasing 7.6% sequentially to $11.5 million or 17.3% of total sales for the quarter. Bookings for the fourth quarter were $98.0 million, which drove our book to bill ratio to 1.48:1, up from 1.16:1 in the third quarter of 2009. Ending backlog increased 91.2% sequentially to $66.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $34.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2009.
Gross margin improved significantly to 36.8% in the fourth quarter, up from 30.1% in the third quarter of 2009 and 27.2% for the fourth quarter of 2008. The sequential improvement was driven largely by leverage against our fixed costs from the increase in revenues.
Fourth quarter net income was $1.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $8.4 million or a loss per share of $0.20 in the third quarter of 2009. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the net loss was $19.0 million or a loss per share of $0.45, the vast majority of which was a non-cash charge of $18.0 million for income taxes related to a valuation allowance against our
 
deferred tax assets. We are pleased to report that we ended 2009 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $177.5 million, a decline of just $2.6 million due to our careful cash management during the year.
For the full year 2009, sales were $186.4 million, 43.3% below sales of $328.9 million in 2008. The challenging economic environment impacted sales across all markets, most notably in the semiconductor capital equipment market where sales fell 43.1% from 2008. Net loss from operations for 2009 was $102.7 million, or a loss per share of $2.45. More than half of this was due to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of 2009 of $63.3 million or $1.51 per share. Net loss for 2008 was $1.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share.
"The fourth quarter marked a high point in 2009, as we grew revenues and achieved profitability by leveraging the cost reductions taken during the year," said Hans Betz, chief executive officer. "The pace of the recovery in the semiconductor capital equipment market ramped significantly in the quarter, as did the penetration of our Solaron inverters into larger, multi-megawatt projects. When the global economy recovers, we expect to benefit from the investments we made in technology during the downturn and our growth in multiple markets."
First Quarter 2010 Guidance
The Company anticipates first quarter 2010 results to be within the following ranges:

Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On March 24, 2010, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. ("") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "") with Neptune Acquisition Sub, Inc. (""), an Oregon corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Advanced Energy, and PV Powered, Inc., an Oregon corporation ("").

Merger Agreement
Acquisition Sub
PV Powered
Merger
Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon the closing of the Merger, shareholders of PV Powered will receive cash in the amount of $35,000,000 minus certain closing date indebtedness and unsatisfied transaction costs, plus $15,000,000 in shares of common stock of Advanced Energy. Additional cash consideration in an amount of up to $40,000,000 is payable to the shareholders of PV Powered if certain financial targets are met during the period between the closing and December 31, 2010. Advanced Energy has covenanted to file a registration statement within 60 days of the closing of the Merger to register the public resale of the shares issued to the shareholders of PV Powered in the Merger.
The Merger Agreement and the Merger were approved by the boards of directors of each of Advanced Energy, Acquisition Sub and PV Powered. The consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, obtaining the approval of the shareholders of PV Powered, the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, and the absence of any development or event since the date of the Merger Agreement that has or would reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on either PV Powered (in the case of Advanced Energy's obligation to close) or Advanced Energy (in the case of PV Powered's obligation to close).
The Merger Agreement contains a customary non-solicitation provision restricting PV Powered with respect to its rights to negotiate or enter into other acquisition or sale transactions before the closing of the Merger. In addition, Advanced Energy, Acquisition Sub and PV Powered each made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Advanced Energy and PV Powered.
The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Advanced Energy. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to such agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement. The representations and warranties may have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Advance Energy, PV Powered, or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Advanced Energy's public disclosures.
PV Powered, founded in 2003, is a rapidly growing, privately owned solar inverter company based in Bend, Oregon. PV Powered utilizes certain proprietary inverter technology to develop and produce lines of commercial, utility and residential solar inverters.
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

All reasonable, third party costs and expenses incurred in connection with a Claimant's cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. In any event, the Claimant shall have the right at its own expense to participate in the defense of such asserted liability.

          (g) A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-Person claim shall be promptly asserted by written notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought; provided, however, that failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not preclude the Claimant from any indemnification which it may claim in accordance with this , except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party.

          (j) The good faith exercise by the Acquiror of the right of set-off provided by this , whether or not ultimately determined to be justified, shall not constitute a violation of this Agreement or otherwise result in any liability to the Acquiror so long as remittance is made in accordance with . Neither the exercise nor the failure to exercise such right of set-off will constitute an election of remedies or will limit an Acquiror Indemnified Party in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it.

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Fort Collins, Colo., March 24, 2010  Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire PV Powered Inc., a leading manufacturer of grid-tied PV inverters in the residential, commercial, and utility-scale markets. The acquisition is expected to add an estimated $40-50 million to Advanced Energy's 2010 revenues and be neutral to marginally dilutive to GAAP net income in 2010.
"We are very excited to announce this acquisition and believe the combination of Advanced Energy and PV Powered will continue our strong momentum in the inverter market, propelling us forward as a leading manufacturer of solar inverters in North America. The addition of PV Powered's transformer-based inverters with power levels below 500kw for the small to mid range commercial inverter market allows Advanced Energy to target a portion of the market that we have not yet addressed. As a combined company, our comprehensive portfolio of both transformerless and transformer-based inverter products will serve the entire spectrum of commercial project sizes from 30kw to multi-megawatt utility installations, placing us firmly at the heart of the emerging and fast-growing solar inverter market," said Hans Betz, chief executive officer of Advanced Energy.
PV Powered is an innovation leader for high-reliability transformer-based PV inverters utilized in commercial roof top and ground mount systems in the North American market. Founded in 2003 and based in Bend, Oregon, PV Powered is a privately held company with approximately 90 employees and $21 million of revenues in 2009. Its inverters range in size from 30kw to 260kw for the commercial market and 1kw to 5kw for the residential market, with market leading
 
efficiency ratings. PV Powered's experienced inverter engineering team has continuously optimized the performance and reliability of its inverters allowing PV Powered to offer the industry's first standard 10 year product warranty and optional 20 year extended warranty.
"The employees and management of PV Powered are extremely excited at the prospect of joining Advanced Energy," said Gregg Patterson, chief executive officer of PV Powered. "PV Powered and Advanced Energy have a collective history of industry innovation, driven by a commitment to power conversion efficiency and inverter reliability that leads the market. Both organizations share a common mission to deliver the lowest levelized cost of energy and the highest levels of customer satisfaction. Together, we can offer the broadest technology and product portfolio in the industry."
Under the agreement, Advanced Energy will acquire PV Powered for a purchase price of up to $90 million consisting of $50 million to be paid at closing in the form of $35 million in cash and $15 million in Advanced Energy's common stock, as well as up to $40 million in a potential earn-out based on PV Powered's full year 2010 financial results. The transaction will be subject to a number of other customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals including Hart Scott Rodino. Throughout 2010, PV Powered will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary, continuing to sell and support its PV Powered branded inverters.
Currently, we anticipate sales of PV Powered's inverter to contribute as much as $40M-$50 million to Advanced Energy's 2010 revenue. Of that, we expect $30-35 million to come from sales to the commercial market and $10-15 million from the residential market. We anticipate gross margins on these products to be in the range of 26-29% and have additional operating expenses of $3-4 million.
Needham & Company, LLC acted as the financial advisor and provided a fairness opinion to Advanced Energy related to this transaction.

Merger Agreement
Regulation D
The Amendment provides that (i) the exercise price of any options and warrants to purchase capital stock of PV Powered that are exercised other than by cash payment prior to the closing will be satisfied by deducting the aggregate exercise price from the cash consideration payable to the holder under the Merger Agreement and (ii) the merger consideration payable at closing will be allocated such that certain holders of PV Powered stock options who are not accredited investors under Regulation D will receive only cash consideration at closing. These amendments do not result in any change to the aggregate merger consideration payable by the Company under the Merger Agreement.
The other terms of the Merger Agreement not expressly amended by the Amendment are unchanged and continue in full force and effect. The consummation of the merger remains subject to satisfaction of certain closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a copy of which was filed by the Company as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 24, 2010.
The foregoing description of the Amendment does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the Amendment, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8 K and incorporated herein by reference.
The information in this
Form 8-K
that is furnished under "Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
On April 22, 2010, the Company announced via press release its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2010. A copy of the press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
On April 20, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Company, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, established individual performance objectives for the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors established individual performance objectives for each of the other named executive officers of the Company, under the Company's Leadership Corporate Incentive Plan (""). As previously disclosed, the Company maintains two cash bonus plans: the Leadership Plan and the Employee Corporate Incentive Plan (""). The Leadership Plan provides the Company's executive officers and other key leaders, including the Company's named executive
Leadership Plan
Employee Plan
 
officers, with the opportunity to earn cash bonuses based on achievement of corporate performance metrics and individual performance objectives. Participants in the Leadership Plan do not participate in the Employee Plan.
Following the end of each fiscal year, the Company funds a joint bonus pool for awards under the Leadership Plan and the Employee Plan, only if (a) the Company's total revenue for the year equals or exceeds the total revenue set forth in the Company's annual operating plan approved by the Board of Directors (the ""), and (b) the Company's operating income for the year exceeds 5% of the Company's total revenue. Achievement of both of these corporate performance metrics is required in order to fund the bonus pool for the Leadership Plan and achievement of the operating income target only is required to fund the Employee Plan.
AOP Revenue
The amount of the bonus pool for both plans, if a bonus pool is funded, will be equal to 10% of the Company's operating income for the year. However, for 2010, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved an increase in the bonus pool to up to 17.5% of the Company's operating income for the year. If the Company's total revenue exceeds the AOP Revenue by at least $80 million, the bonus pool will be equal to 17.5% of the Company's operating income for the year. The bonus pool will increase incrementally from 10% to 17.5% of the Company's operating income for the year, if the Company's total revenue exceeds the AOP Revenue by less than $80 million.
If the bonus pool is funded, any individual bonus payable to a named executive officer under the Leadership Plan will be based upon such named executive officer's (a) pre-established target bonus, (b) annual performance review and (c) achievement of individual performance objectives, subject to consideration of the total size of the bonus pool and the limitation that no participant may receive a bonus greater than 150% of his or her pre-established target bonus.
The pre-established target bonuses for the Company's named executive officers under the Leadership Plan are as follows:
The individual performance objectives for the named executive officers are based upon each named executive officer's individual contributions to the Company's overall execution of its initiatives in the categories of (1) revenue growth, (2) long-term strategic planning and execution, (3) organizational development and succession planning, (4) business and financial process development and (5) management of acquisitions or divestitures. Dr. Betz also has individual performance objectives with respect to investor relations, enhancing stockholder return and maintaining quality controls. Mr. Wasserman also has an individual performance objective with respect to the launch of a one megawatt Solaron inverter.
The Board of Directors maintains the discretion to evaluate each executive officer's performance against his individual performance objectives and determine the relative weight of such objectives.

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Fort Collins, Colo., April 22, 2010
Sales for the first quarter of 2010 increased 22.7% to $81.6 million from $66.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, and increased 150.0% from $32.6 million in the first quarter of 2009.
Sales were robust in the first quarter driven by strong growth in the semiconductor market. Semiconductor sales rose 47.7% sequentially to $48.6 million, representing 59.6% of total sales for the quarter. Sales to the non-semiconductor markets increased 3.9% sequentially to $21.5 million, representing 26.3% of total sales for the quarter. Service revenue was flat sequentially at $11.5 million, representing 14.1% of total sales for the quarter.
Bookings for the first quarter were $96.7 million compared to $98.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.19:1 for the first quarter. Ending backlog increased 22.8% sequentially to $81.3 million at the end of the first quarter compared to $66.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2009.
Gross margin improved significantly to 40.6% in the first quarter, up from 36.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009, as a result of greater efficiencies and improved operating leverage due to higher revenues. This compares to 19.6% in the same period last year.
Operating expenses rose 11.0% sequentially to $25.0 million as we eliminated our temporary cost reductions related to pay cuts and shutdowns. In addition, expenses associated with the pending acquisition of PV Powered were $325,000 ($0.01 per share).
 
First quarter net income was $6.2 million or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009. In the same period a year ago, net loss was $79.8 million or a loss of $1.90 per share due primarily to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $63.3 million or $1.51 per share. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $163.4 million at the end of the first quarter, a decrease of $14.1 million from the fourth quarter due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory to support the growth in revenues.
"Marked by the third consecutive quarter of greater than 20% total revenue growth, we were extremely pleased with our first quarter results. Momentum in the semiconductor capital equipment market drove the majority of the growth this quarter continuing the three-quarter trend of over 40% expansion in that market," said Dr. Hans Betz, chief executive officer. "Advanced Energy once again distinguished itself as one of the premier suppliers as we successfully managed through supply chain constraints in order to meet aggressive customer demand."
"In keeping with our strategy to increase Advanced Energy's presence in the renewable energy market, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire PV Powered, a leading manufacturer of grid-tied PV inverters serving the commercial and residential markets. The combined company will offer a complete suite of products, propelling Advanced Energy forward as a leader in the North American solar inverter market."
On March 24, 2010, Advanced Energy announced a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of PV Powered. Pending review under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act, we expect the acquisition to close in early May. We will provide updated guidance once the acquisition is complete.
Second Quarter 2010 Guidance
The Company anticipates second quarter 2010 results to be within the following ranges:

Tenant shall have one (1) option to extend the term of this Lease for two (2) years at market rate ("Option Term"). Tenant shall give written notice to landlord no later than December 31, 2014. Option Term Rent: Tenant shall pay the following rent for the Leased Premises: Landlord and Tenant will attempt to agree upon a Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises satisfactory to both parties within thirty (30) days of Tenant's exercise of its option. If no agreement can be reached by the parties during that period, then the Base Monthly Rental for the Option Term shall be determined by the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises as determined by comparison to premises of similar size located in or near the City of Fort Collins, Colorado, having comparable development, use and density capability and such other characteristics as may be deemed relevant by a subject appraiser whose selection is outlined herein. Landlord shall select an independent MAI real estate appraiser with at least ten (10) years experience in appraising commercial real property in the City of Fort Collins, Colorado (a "Qualified Appraiser"). The Qualified Appraiser selected by the Landlord shall be referred to as the "Landlord's Appraiser". Within thirty (30) days of being selected by the Landlord, the Landlord's Appraiser shall determine the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises in accordance with the appraisal standards set forth above and shall immediately give the Landlord and the Tenant written notification of his determination. If the Tenant agrees with the Landlord's Appraiser's determination of the Fair Market Rental Value, the new Base Monthly Rental shall become effective beginning with the first month of the Option Term.

If the Fair Market Rental Value determined by the Landlord's Appraiser and the Tenant's Appraiser, respectively, differ by an amount which is greater than 5% then, within ten (10) business days after the Landlord's Appraiser and the Tenant's Appraiser's determination of the Fair Market Rental Value, the Landlord's Appraiser and the Tenant's Appraiser shall agree upon and select a third Qualified Appraiser who shall be independent of and have no prior or existing affiliation or relationship with either the Landlord or the Tenant (the "Independent Appraiser"). Within ten (10) business days of being appointed, the Independent Appraiser shall, after exercising his best professional judgment, choose either the Landlord's Appraiser's or the Tenant's Appraiser's determination of Fair Market Rental Value which the Independent Appraiser believes, in his best professional judgment, best represents the Fair Market Rental Value at that point in time. Upon making such a selection, the Independent Appraiser shall immediately give the Landlord and the Tenant written notice of this selection of the Fair Market Rental Value. The Fair Market Rental Value selected by the Independent Appraiser shall be used to calculate the new Base Monthly Rental which will be in effect during the Extension Option, and such selection by the Independent Appraiser shall be binding and conclusive upon the Landlord and the Tenant. All appraisal fees required hereunder shall be shared equally by the Landlord and the Tenant.
All other terms and conditions of that Lease Agreement between Landlord and Tenant dated March 14, 1994, Amendment of Lease Agreement dated March 20, 1996, and Lease Amendment dated December 31, 2008, which have not been superseded by terms and conditions of this Lease Amendment, shall remain the same.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To the Board of Directors PV Powered, Inc
We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of PV Powered, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2009 and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PV Powered, Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred and continues to incur losses from operations since inception. Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 14. Those conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

PV POWERED, INC. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 PV Powered was formed in January of 2003 as a limited liability company. On January 1, 2006 the company converted to a C Corporation and is organized under the laws of the state of Oregon. PV Powered, Inc. designs, manufacturers, sells, and services grid-tied, solar inverters for residential and commercial applications. The company is based in Bend, Oregon.
Nature of operations
 Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Estimates include the collectability of accounts receivable, valuation of inventory, warranty costs, loss contingencies, product life cycles, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and estimating the fair value for impairment of intangible assets. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions.
Estimates and assumptions
 Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Provisions are estimated and when appropriate, recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts. Revenue recognition generally occurs upon shipment of product.
Revenue recognition
 Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related indirect costs associated with product development. The company expenses all research and development costs as incurred.
Research and development
 Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, indirect costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $51,510 for the year ended December 31, 2009.
Sales and marketing
 Freight billed to customers is included in revenue and shipping expense are included in cost of sales.
Shipping and handling costs
 The Company considers all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 Trade accounts receivable is recorded at the amount the Company expects to collect on balances at year-end. Management closely monitors outstanding balances and writes off any balances considered uncollectible. Accounts receivable are considered delinquent based on contractual terms, which is typically between 30 and 60 days. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.
Accounts receivable
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with suppliers, and the estimated value of inventory. If management's review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, inventory values are reduced to a new cost basis.
Inventories
 Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Major expenditures and those which substantially increase the useful lives will be capitalized. Maintenance, repairs, and minor replacements will be charged to operations when incurred. When property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the stated accounts and any gain or loss is included in income from operations.
Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements
Depreciation is provided on property and equipment using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease or their estimated useful lives.
 Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are stated at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the asset. Intangible assets at December 31, 2009 consisted of purchased technology related to the software that formed part of the initial operating platform for the Company's products, costs incurred to obtain Underwriters Laboratory (UL) approval for its commercial products, and certain patents held by the Company. The UL costs, software and patents are being amortized over estimated useful lives of 5, 15 and 17.5 years, respectively.
Intangible assets
 Management of the Company reviews the carrying value of capitalized tangible assets on a regular basis to reach a judgment concerning possible permanent impairment of value. These reviews consider, among other factors, (1) the net realizable value of each major classification of assets, (2) the cash flow associated with the assets, and (3) significant changes in the extent or manner in which major assets are used. Management believes the carrying value of assets is less than the estimated fair value.

PV POWERED, INC. NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty claims based on both current and historical product performance trends and actual warranty costs incurred. The majority of the Company's products carry a 10 year warranty, and the Company has sold extended warranties for 20 years on some of its commercial products. The Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability annually and adjusts the amount as necessary. Sales of extended warranties are recorded as liabilities and no revenue is recognized until the ultimate outcome of the warranty contract can be determined. No revenue was recognized for the sale of extended warranties during 2009.
Warranty
 The Company recognizes the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as the stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black Scholes) pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards. Stock based compensation plans, related expenses and assumptions used in the Black Scholes option pricing model are more fully described in Note 9.
Stock based compensation
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash accounts with two financial institutions where, at times, deposits exceed federal insurance limits. The balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has credit risk regarding trade accounts receivable. The Company performs initial and ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial position, and generally extends credit on account, without collateral. The Company determines the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its historical experience and the expected collectiblity of accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2009, 26% of the Company's revenue was earned from three customers and 34% of the Company's accounts receivable is due from three customers.
Concentration of credit risk
 Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. The Company will establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 (continued)
NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
As of January 1, 2009, the Company adopted the new accounting requirement for uncertain tax positions, which had no financial statement impact to the Company. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense if incurred.
 In 2009 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 815-40, which requires instruments that are not considered to be indexed to the Company's own stock to be treated as derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The changes in fair values are adjusted through charges to income on the statement of operations. The Company only uses derivatives in the form of warrants to purchase common stock issued as financing incentives to lenders. Warrant derivatives are more fully discussed in Note 6. Adoption of ASC Subtopic 815-40 did not have a material effect on opening retained earnings.

The bank loan was paid off during 2009. The Company has assigned no value to these warrants upon issuance or at December 31, 2009, based on the results of the use of a Black Scholes pricing model, largely driven by the relative difference between the strike price and the estimated fair value of the Company's common stock.

The 3 Tier LOC lenders were also granted detachable warrants to purchase the Company's common stock. The amount of warrants granted is equal to the highest amount of principal and interest outstanding during the loan period divided by the strike price. The strike price, ranging between $5.00 and $.025 per share at the grant dates, resets to equal the price per share or strike price assigned to any equity or equity like instruments granted subsequent to the grant dates, and was $.01 per share at December 31, 2009. The Company has accounted for the fair value of these warrants as a liability in accordance with ASC Topic 815, as they do not meet the definition of "indexed to the issuers own stock" as prescribed by ASC 815-40, As these warrants are treated as derivative instrument liabilities, the value is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date, with the change in fair value recorded as interest expense in the statement of operations.

As part of that round of financing, the preferred stockholders were also given an incentive to guarantee the $5,000,000 Key Bank Line of Credit in the form of detachable warrants to purchase the Company's common stock at $.01 per share. The number of warrants granted being a function of the highest amount of loan outstanding and guaranteed during the loan period divided by the strike price, for a total of 500,000,000 outstanding at December 31, 2009. The Company has accounted for these warrants as equity instruments in accordance ASC 815-40, as they meet the definition of "indexed to the issuers own stock" as prescribed by that guidance. As these warrants are treated as equity instruments, they were measured and recorded at the grant date fair value and are not remeasured to fair value in subsequent periods. The fair value of these warrants recorded in equity is $3,326,010.

NOTE 9  STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
The Company maintains two different stock compensation plans. Restricted stock awards are grants that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests. The Company's stock grants generally vest on a graduated basis over a three-year period. Stock options entitle the holder the right to purchase shares or common stock at a predetermined price as the award vests. The Company's stock options generally vest over a four-year period and expire 7 to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense is recorded when the awards vest and the Company issues new shares on the date the restricted units vest or the option is exercised.
 During 2006, shareholders approved the 2006 Restricted Stock Plan. Shareholders approved 200,000 shares for issuance as equity awards to employees. The 2006 Restricted Stock Plan allows for time-based vesting for equity incentive awards. During February 2008, the Board of Directors retired the remaining shares issuable under the 2006 Restricted Stock Plan. As of December 31, 2009, no shares remained available for future grant under the 2006 Restricted Stock Plan.
Restricted stock unit awards
Information with respect to outstanding restricted stock unit activity is as follows:
As of December 31, 2009, there was no unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock units granted under the Company's equity incentive plan.
 During 2006, the Board of Directors (the Board) approved the 2006 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the 2006 Plan). The Board approved 218,000 shares for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors. During February 2008, the Board approved an additional 107,450 shares for issuance under The Plan. The Plan allows for time-based vesting for equity incentive awards, as well as immediate vesting upon a change in control. As of December 31, 2008, 159,099 shares remained available for future grant under the Plan.

 STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
During 2009, the Board approved the 2009 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the 2009 Plan). The Board approved 305,780,000 shares for issuance as equity awards to employees and non-employee directors. The Plan allows for time-based vesting for equity incentive awards. As of December 31, 2009, 1,251,368 shares remained available for future grant under the Plan.
The following describes the key assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model to derive the calculated value for the year ended December 31:
The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes model was based on the volatility of the stock price of three publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the Company. The Company calculated the historical volatility of the example companies for the year using the daily closing total returns for that index incorporating the seven most recent years in its analysis since that was the expected life at the time of calculation. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
The Company expenses stock options on a straight-line basis over the options' related vesting term. Stock based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $276,151, of which $14,543 recorded in cost of goods sold, $71,808 in research and development, $47,812 in sales and marketing, and $141,988 in general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2009 there is $2,052,543 of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plans.

NOTE 10  FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of warrants to purchase shares of common stock as borrowing incentive, as more fully addressed in Note 6 above. The Company records the fair value of such derivatives on its balance sheet and in its statement of operations as an unrealized gain or loss in the change in fair value of the warrant derivative. The change in the fair value of the warrant derivative for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $4,516,680.
The Company has applied the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10, for purposes of measuring its derivative liabilities. ASC 820-10 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
Fair Value Measurements,
The Company's warrant derivatives, which are considered Level 3 fair value measurements, are valued using the Black Scholes pricing model. The Company does not have any other material Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 financial assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, there were no material financial assets or liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis that required adjustments or write-downs.
Significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the derivative liability using the Black Scholes pricing model at December 31, 2009 were as follows:

The volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes model was based on the volatility of the stock price of three publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the Company. The Company calculated the historical volatility of the example companies for the year using the daily closing total returns for that index incorporating the seven most recent two years in its analysis since that was the expected life at the time of calculation. The risk-free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
Liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the Company consisted of the following as of December 31:
The fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, current portion of shareholder lines of credit, and the bank line of credit approximate carrying value, principally because of the short maturity of those items. The fair values of long tem shareholder lines of credit and capitalized lease obligations approximate carrying value based on their effective interest rates compared to current market rates.
NOTE 11
RETIREMENT PLAN
The Company has a 401(k) plan that covers substantially all employees. Participating employees may elect to contribute, on a tax-deferred basis, a portion or their compensation in accordance with Section 401(k) or the Internal Revenue Code. Company contributions may be made to the plan at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Company made no contributions to the plan for the year ended December 31, 2009.

 (continued)
NOTE 13  INCOME TAXES
As of December 31, 2009, the Company has remaining deferred tax benefits related to its federal, state and foreign net operating losses totaling approximately $970,000. These NOLs will expire, in varying amounts, beginning in 2010 through 2029. The potential future tax benefits of the NOLs have been fully offset by a valuation allowance based on the Company's analysis of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in the various jurisdictions to utilize the benefits before expiration.
The Company has not performed a valuation during 2009 to determine the value of the prior year NOLs in regards to IRC Section 382. The Company has determined a change in ownership occurred on June 30, 2009. Therefore the Deferred Tax Asset of these prior year NOLs has not been recognized. The gross amount of these prior year NOLs are $6,958,000. These NOLs will expire, in varying amounts, beginning 2010 through 2025. The company has allocated the current year NOL in accordance to IRC Section 382.
Components of income tax expense (benefit) included in the financial statements are as follows for the years ended December 31, 2009:
The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits which would require an adjustment to the January 1, 2009 beginning balance of retained earnings and had no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009. No interest and penalties have been accrued upon adoption or for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in Oregon, California, Massachusetts, Florida and New York. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years before 2007 for its federal filings and 2007 for its State filings.

NOTE 14  GOING CONCERN
This financial statement has been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As reported in this financial statement, the Company incurred a net loss of $12,230,168 during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of that date, the Company's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $5,430,182 and its total liabilities exceeded its total assets by $13,651,376. These factors indicate a substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. During January, 2010 the Company was able to negotiate an extension to the bank line of credit, and is currently working on negotiations with potential strategic partners and investors to secure additional financing or for the sale of the Company. Management and the Board of Directors have signed a non-binding Letter of Intent to sell the Company and are hopeful that the Company will conclude negotiations and receive funding or sell the Company by the end of July 2010. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the success of these plans and there can be no guaranty that the Company will be successful in these efforts.

NOTE 1  BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Financial Statements and Notes thereto for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 (See Exhibit 99.1).
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
PV Powered was formed in January of 2003 as a limited liability company. On January 1, 2006 the company converted to a C Corporation and is organized under the laws of the state of Oregon. PV Powered, Inc. designs, manufacturers, sells, and services grid-tied, solar inverters for residential and commercial applications. The company is based in Bend, Oregon.
Nature of operations 
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Estimates include the collectability of accounts receivable, valuation of inventory, warranty costs, loss contingencies, product life cycles, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns and estimating the fair value for impairment of intangible assets. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions.
Estimates and assumptions 
 Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, shipment has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Provisions are estimated and when appropriate, recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts. Revenue recognition generally occurs upon shipment of product.
Revenue recognition
 Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related indirect costs associated with product development. The company expenses all research and development costs as incurred.
Research and development
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, indirect costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $46 for the three-months ended March 31, 2010.
Sales and marketing 
 Freight billed to customers is included in revenue and shipping expense is included in cost of sales.
Shipping and handling costs
The Company considers all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents 
 
 (continued)
NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Trade accounts receivable is recorded at the amount the Company expects to collect on balances at year-end. Management closely monitors outstanding balances and writes off any balances considered uncollectible. Accounts receivable is considered delinquent based on contractual terms, which is typically between 30 and 60 days. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management's best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.
Accounts receivable 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the first-in first-out method. The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with suppliers, and the estimated value of inventory. If management's review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, inventory values are reduced to a new cost basis.
Inventories 
 Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are stated at cost. Major expenditures and those which substantially increase the useful lives will be capitalized. Maintenance, repairs, and minor replacements will be charged to operations when incurred. When property, equipment, and leasehold improvements are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the stated accounts and any gain or loss is included in income from operations.
Property, equipment, and leasehold improvements
Depreciation is provided on property and equipment using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease or their estimated useful lives.
- Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are stated at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the asset. Intangible assets at March 31, 2010 consisted of purchased technology related to the software that formed part of the initial operating platform for the Company's products, costs incurred to obtain Underwriters Laboratory (UL) approval for its commercial products, and certain patents held by the Company. The UL costs, software and patents are being amortized over estimated useful lives of 5, 15 and 17.5 years, respectively.
Intangible assets
 Management of the Company reviews the carrying value of capitalized tangible assets on a regular basis to reach a judgment concerning possible permanent impairment of value. These reviews consider, among other factors, (1) the net realizable value of each major classification of assets, (2) the cash flow associated with the assets, and (3) significant changes in the extent or manner in which major assets are used. Management believes the carrying value of assets is less than the estimated fair value.
Recoverability of long-lived assets
 
 (continued)
NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty claims based on both current and historical product performance trends and actual warranty costs incurred. The majority of the Company's products carry a 10 year warranty, and the Company has sold extended warranties for 20 years on some of its commercial products. The Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability annually and adjusts the amount as necessary. Sales of extended warranties are recorded as liabilities and no revenue is recognized until the ultimate outcome of the warranty contract can be determined. No revenue was recognized for the sale of extended warranties during the three months ended March 31, 2010.
Warranty
 The Company recognizes the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, such as the stock options and restricted stock, based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (Black Scholes) pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards.
Stock-based compensation
- Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company maintains its cash accounts with two financial institutions where, at times, deposits exceed federal insurance limits. The balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company has credit risk regarding trade accounts receivable. The Company performs initial and ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial position, and generally extends credit on account, without collateral. The Company determines the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its historical experience and the expected collectiblity of accounts receivable. For the three-months ended March 31, 2010, 29% of the Company's revenue was earned from four customers and 33% of the Company's accounts receivable is due from four customers.
Concentration of credit risk
- Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. The Company will establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain.
Income taxes
 
 (continued)
NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense if incurred.
 Derivative financial instruments are recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The changes in fair values are adjusted through charges to income on the statement of operations. The Company only uses derivatives in the form of warrants to purchase common stock issued as financing incentives to lenders.

The fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, current portion of shareholder lines of credit, and the bank line of credit approximate carrying value, principally because of the short maturity of those items. The fair values of long-tem shareholder lines of credit and capitalized lease obligations approximate carrying value based on their effective interest rates compared to current market rates.
 
NOTE 11  OTHER INCOME
During the three-months ended March 31, 2010, the Company participated in the Solar Energy Grid Integration System Program (SEGIS) sponsored by the Department of Energy and administered by Sandia National Labs.

NOTE 12  INCOME TAXES
As of March 31, 2010, the Company has remaining deferred tax benefits related to its federal, state and foreign net operating losses totaling approximately $970. These NOLs will expire, in varying amounts, beginning in 2010 through 2029. The potential future tax benefits of the NOLs have been fully offset by a valuation allowance based on the Company's analysis of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in the various jurisdictions to utilize the benefits before expiration.
The Company has not performed a valuation during the three months ended March 31, 2010 to determine the value of the prior year NOLs in regards to IRC Section 382. The Company has determined a change in ownership occurred on June 30, 2009. Therefore the Deferred Tax Asset of these prior year NOLs has not been recognized. The gross amount of these prior year NOLs are $6,958. These NOLs will expire, in varying amounts, beginning 2010 through 2025. The company has allocated the current year NOL in accordance to IRC Section 382.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet assumes that the Merger took place on March 31, 2010 and combines Advanced Energy's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet with PV Powered's unaudited balance sheet as of March 31, 2010.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 assumes that the Merger took place on January 1, 2010, the first day of Advanced Energy's fiscal year 2010. As such, Advanced Energy's unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010 has been combined with PV Powered's unaudited statement of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2010.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 assumes that the Merger took place on January 1, 2009, the first day of Advanced Energy's fiscal year 2009. As such, Advanced Energy's audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 has been combined with PV Powered's audited statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009.
The historical consolidated financial information of Advanced Energy and PV Powered have been adjusted in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements to give effect to pro forma
 
events that are (1) directly attributable to the Merger, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with respect to the statement of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes thereto. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information was based on and should be read in conjunction with the:

In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information does not purport to project the future financial position or operating results of the combined Company. There were no material transactions between Advanced Energy and PV Powered during the periods presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements that needed to be eliminated.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information has been prepared using the acquisition method of accounting under standards established by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP"), which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values at the Acquisition Date. The Company's judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company's results of operations. The finalization of the Company's acquisition accounting assessment will result in changes in the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired which could be material. The Company will finalize the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable within the measurement period, but in no event later than one year following the Acquisition Date.

NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION
On May 3, 2010 (the "Merger Date" or "Acquisition Date"), Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. ("Advanced Energy" or the "Company") acquired PV Powered, Inc. ("PV Powered"), a privately-held Oregon corporation and a leading solar inverter company based in Bend, Oregon, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 24, 2010 between Advanced Energy, PV Powered and Neptune Acquisition Sub, Inc. ("Acquisition Sub"), an Oregon corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Advanced Energy, and Amendment No. 1 to Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 21, 2010 (together with the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the "Merger Agreement"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub merged with and into PV Powered, with PV Powered being the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Advanced Energy (the "Merger" or "Acquisition").
The acquisition of PV Powered enables Advanced Energy to offer the inverter market a more complete suite of products in all power ranges and increases the number of solar array opportunities for which the Company's products can be considered for purchase.
Advanced Energy acquired all of the outstanding PV Powered common stock for total consideration with a fair value of approximately $89.6 million on the Acquisition Date consisting of approximately $36.0 million of cash, Advanced Energy common stock with a market value of approximately $14.7 million and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of approximately $38.9 million as of the Acquisition Date.
Shareholders of PV Powered received approximately $36.7 million of cash less certain closing date indebtedness plus approximately 0.86 shares of Advanced Energy common stock for each 100 shares of PV Powered common stock, options and warrants outstanding as of the Acquisition Date. The approximately 1.0 million shares of Advanced Energy common stock issued had a fair market value of $14.7 million, or $14.72 per share, based on the closing price of Advanced Energy's common stock on April 30, 2010, the last trading day prior to the Acquisition Date. Fractional shares generated by the conversion were settled for cash. Additional cash consideration in an amount of up to $40.0 million is payable to the shareholders of PV Powered if certain financial targets are met during the year ended December 31, 2010. The fair value of the $40.0 million contingent consideration arrangement was estimated to be $39.0 million as of the Acquisition Date based on a projected cash payout of $39.4 million in January 2011.
NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The Acquisition is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The Company is accounting for the transaction by using Advanced Energy historical information and accounting policies and adding the assets and liabilities of PV Powered as of the Acquisition Date at their respective fair values. Under the acquisition method, the total purchase price (consideration transferred) as described in Note 3, Consideration Transferred, was measured as of the Acquisition Date using the market price of Advanced
 
Energy's common stock at that time. The assets and liabilities of PV Powered have been measured at fair value based on various assumptions that the Company's management believes are reasonable utilizing information as of the Acquisition Date.
The process for measuring the fair values of identifiable intangible assets and certain tangible assets requires the use of significant assumptions, including future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. The excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the amount of identifiable assets and liabilities of PV Powered as of the Acquisition Date was allocated to goodwill.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal (most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. Additionally, fair value measurements for an asset assume the highest and best use of that asset by market participants.
NOTE 3. CONSIDERATION TRANSFERED
The components of the fair value of the total consideration transferred for the PV Powered Acquisition on the Acquisition Date is as follows (in thousands):
 
NOTE 4. ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED
Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of PV Powered's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of May 3, 2010, the Acquisition Date. The excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets is recorded as goodwill. Advanced Energy has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price based on the unaudited historical balance sheet of PV Powered as of May 3, 2010, and using estimates as described in the introduction to these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements as follows (in thousands):
Advanced Energy has evaluated and continues to evaluate pre-acquisition contingencies related to PV Powered that may exist as of the Acquisition Date. If these pre-acquisition contingencies become probable in nature and estimable during the remainder of the purchase price allocation period, amounts will be recorded to Acquisition Date liabilities and goodwill for such matters. If these pre-acquisition contingencies become probable in nature and estimable after the end of the purchase price allocation period, amounts will be recorded for such matters in Advanced Energy's results of operations.
 
NOTE 5. ADJUSTMENTS TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED BALANCE SHEET:
Reflects adjustments to cash, contingent consideration liability and stockholders' equity (see Item (j) below) for Acquisition Date consideration transferred as follows (in thousands):
Item (a):
Adjustment to inventory to reflect the fair value of acquired inventory as of the Acquisition Date. Advanced Energy's cost of sales will reflect the increased valuation of PV Powered's inventory as the acquired inventory is sold, which will occur within the first four months after the Acquisition. The increase in inventory is as follows (in thousands):
Item (b):
Adjustment to deferred tax assets to reduce valuation allowances for net operating losses acquired expected to be realized by the Company:
Item (c):
Eliminate PV Powered's unamortized debt issuance costs included in other current assets as there were no future economic benefits associated with these assets as of the Acquisition Date (in thousands):
Item (d):
 
As of the Acquisition Date, identifiable intangible assets were measured at fair value determined primarily using the "income approach," which required a forecast of all the expected future cash flows, either through the use of the relief-from-royalty method or the multi-period excess earnings method. The pro forma adjustments to intangible assets have the impact of recording the fair value of intangible assets at the Acquisition Date and eliminating the PV Powered historical carrying value of intangible assets as follows (in thousands):
Item (e):
The amortization methods and estimated useful lives of identifiable intangible assets are set forth in the table below. Backlog amortization expense is included in cost of sales (see Item (k) below). All other amortization expense is included in amortization of intangible assets (see Item (l) below).
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the Acquisition Date fair value of the consideration transferred and the values assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is subject to impairment testing, on at least an annual basis. Advanced Energy has made a preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase price using various estimates (in thousands):
Item (f):
The goodwill resulting from the Acquisition will not be tax deductible.
 
Reflects adjustments to eliminate PV Powered's accrued interest payable included in other accrued liabilities, short-term debt, accrued interest payable included in other long-term liabilities, and long-term debt resulting from cash consideration transferred by Advanced Energy and used by PV Powered to repay certain interest-bearing debt outstanding as of the Acquisition Date (in thousands):
Item (g):
Record increases in deferred income tax liabilities for capitalized intangible assets resulting from the acquisition.
Item (h):
Eliminate PV Powered's warrant derivative liabilities as of the Acquisition Date. These liabilities were satisfied as a result of Advanced Energy's acquisition of all outstanding PV Powered warrants to purchase PV Powered common stock (in thousands):
Item (i):
Eliminate PV Powered's historical stockholder's deficit, net loss April 1, 2010 to May 3, 2010, and record the fair value of Advanced Energy's common stock issued (in thousands):
Item (j):
 
NOTE 6. ADJUSTMENTS TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS:
Record additional cost of salesas a result of amortizing the fair value of order backlog intangible asset (see Item (e) above) acquired as of the Acquisition Date. Also, to record additional cost of sales as a result of amortizing the increase in carrying values of in-process and finished goods inventories as of the Acquisition Date (see also Item (b) above). Cost of sales adjustment (in thousands):
Item (k):
Record additional amortization of intangible assets as a result of adjusting identifiable intangible assets to fair value as of the Acquisition Date (see Item (e) above) and eliminating PV Powered's historical amortization of intangible assets during the three and twelve month periods, respectively (in thousands).
Item (l):

Eliminate PV Powered's historical interest expense during the three and twelve month periods, respectively, and to eliminate PV Powered's historical loss on warrant derivative liabilities during the three and twelve month periods, respectively (in thousands):
Item (m):
Record the pro forma tax effect for the three and twelve month periods, respectively, on the adjustments to pro-forma earnings before income taxes based on an estimated prospective statutory rate of 36% (in thousands):

Indemnification Procedures for Third Party Claims
          (a) In the event that an Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be sought under the provisions of this Article X (""), the Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Third Party Claim (""). Failure or delay in notifying the Indemnitor will not relieve the Indemnitor of any Liability it may have to the Indemnitee, except and only to the extent that such failure or delay causes actual harm to the Indemnitor with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Notice of Claim shall set forth the amount, if known, or, if not known, an estimate of the foreseeable maximum amount of claimed Losses (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Losses) and a description of the basis for such Third Party Claim.
Third Party Claim
Notice of Claim
          (b) Subject to the further provisions of this Section 10.4, the Indemnitor will have 10 days (or less if the nature of the Third Party Claim requires) from the date on which the Indemnitor received the Notice of Claim to notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor will assume the defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice and at its sole cost and expense (a ""). If the Indemnitor assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Indemnitor shall be conclusively deemed to have acknowledged that the Third Party Claim is within the scope of its indemnity obligation hereunder and shall hold the Indemnitee harmless from and against the full amount of any Losses resulting therefrom (subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement). Any Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such Third Party Defense and to participate therein, but the fees and expenses of
Third Party Defense
 
such counsel shall not be at the expense of the Indemnitor unless (A) the Indemnitor shall have failed, within the time after having been notified by the Indemnitee of the existence of the Third Party Claim as provided in the first sentence of this paragraph (b), to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, or (B) the employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnitor, which authorization shall not be unreasonably withheld.
          (c) The Indemnitor will not be entitled to assume the Third Party Defense if:
               (i) the Third Party Claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of monetary damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief (except where non-monetary relief is merely incidental to a primary claim or claims for monetary damages);
               (ii) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation;
               (iii) under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue exists between the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor in respect of the Third Party Claim;
               (iv) the Third Party Claim involves a material customer or supplier of the Business;
               (v) the Indemnitee reasonably believes an adverse determination with respect to the Third Party Claim would be materially detrimental to or materially injure the Indemnitee's reputation or future business prospects;
               (vi) upon petition by the Indemnitee, the appropriate court rules that the Indemnitor failed or is failing to use commercially reasonable efforts to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim;
               (vii) the Indemnitor fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnitee of its financial capacity to prosecute the Third Party Defense and provide indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; or
               (viii) the Third Party Claim would give rise to Losses which are more than the amount indemnifiable by the Indemnitor pursuant to this Article X.
          (d) If by reason of the Third Party Claim a Lien, attachment, garnishment or execution is placed upon any of the property or assets of the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor, if it desires to exercise its right to assume such Third Party Defense, must furnish a satisfactory indemnity bond to obtain the prompt release of such Lien, attachment, garnishment or execution.
          (e) If the Indemnitor assumes a Third Party Defense, it will use reasonable efforts in the defense, prosecution, or settlement of such claim or litigation and will hold all Indemnitees harmless from and against all Losses caused by or arising out of such Third Party Claim (subject to the last sentence of Section 10.4(b)). The Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement except with the written consent of the Indemnitee (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) to which the Indemnitor is obligated to furnish indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; provided that the consent of the Indemnitee shall not be required if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the terms of the judgment or proposed settlement include as an unconditional term thereof the giving to the Indemnitees by the third party of a release of the Indemnitees from all Liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) there is no finding or admission of (A) any violation of Law by the Indemnitees (or any Affiliate thereof), (B) any violation of the rights of any Person and (C) no effect on any other
 
Action or claims of a similar nature that may be made against the Indemnitees (or any Affiliate thereof), and (iii) the sole form of relief is monetary damages which are paid in full by the Indemnitor. The Indemnitor shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and the Indemnitee will provide reasonable cooperation in the defense of the Third Party Claim. So long as the Indemnitor is reasonably conducting the Third Party Defense in good faith, the Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee shall have the right to pay or settle any such Third Party Claim; provided that, in such event, subject to the following sentence, it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the Indemnitor for such claim unless the Indemnitor shall have consented to such payment or settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If the Indemnitor is not reasonably conducting the Third Party Defense in good faith, the Indemnitee shall have the right to consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnitee promptly for all Losses incurred in connection with such judgment or settlement.
          (f) In the event that (i) an Indemnitee gives Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor and the Indemnitor fails or elects not to assume a Third Party Defense which the Indemnitor had the right to assume under this Section 10.4 or (ii) the Indemnitor is not entitled to assume the Third Party Defense pursuant to this Section 10.4, the Indemnitee shall have the right, with counsel of its choice, to defend, conduct and control the Third Party Defense, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor. In each case, the Indemnitee shall conduct the Third Party Defense actively and diligently, and the Indemnitor will provide reasonable cooperation in the Third Party Defense. The Indemnitee shall have the right to consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim on such terms as it may deem appropriate; provided, however, that the amount of any settlement made or entry of any judgment consented to by the Indemnitee without the consent of the Indemnitor shall not be determinative of the validity of the claim, except with the consent of the Indemnitor (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding Section 11.6 hereof, in connection with any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which an Action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against any Indemnitee for purposes of any claim that the Indemnitee may have under this Article X with respect to such Action or the matters alleged therein and agrees that process may be served on the Indemnitor with respect to such a claim anywhere in the world. If the Indemnitor does not elect to assume a Third Party Defense which it has the right to assume hereunder, the Indemnitee shall have no obligation to do so.
          (g) Each party to this Agreement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate and to cause its employees to cooperate with and assist the Indemnitee or the Indemnitor, as the case may be, in connection with any Third Party Defense, including attending conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals and furnishing records, information and testimony, as may reasonably be requested; provided that each party shall use its best efforts, in respect of any Third Party Claim of which it has assumed the defense, to preserve the confidentiality of all confidential information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges.
     10.5 . In the event of a claim that does not involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against it, the Indemnitee shall send a Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor. The Notice of Claim shall set forth the amount, if known, or, if not known, an estimate of the foreseeable maximum amount of claimed Losses (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Losses) and a description of the basis for such claim. The Indemnitor will have 30 days from receipt of such Notice of Claim to dispute the claim and will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitee in determining the validity of the claim for indemnity. If the Indemnitor does not give notice to the Indemnitee that it disputes such claim within 30 days after its receipt of the Notice of
Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims
 
Claim, the claim specified in such Notice of Claim will be conclusively deemed a Loss subject to indemnification hereunder.
     10.6 . An Indemnitee's right to indemnification or other remedies based upon the representations and warranties and covenants and agreements of the Indemnitor will not be affected by any investigation or knowledge of the Indemnitee or any waiver by the Indemnitee of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or compliance with any covenant or agreement. Such representations and warranties and covenants and agreements shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that the Indemnitor knew or should have known that any representation or warrant might be inaccurate or that the Indemnitor failed to comply with any agreement or covenant. Any investigation by such party shall be for its own protection only and shall not affect or impair any right or remedy hereunder.
Effect of Investigation; Waiver
     10.7 .

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
FORT COLLINS, Colo., July 21, 2010Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) (the "Company" or "Advanced Energy") today announced that the Company has entered into an agreement to sell its Aera mass flow control and related product lines and real property in Japan to Hitachi Metals, Ltd., part of Hitachi Metals Group, for $44 million in cash, subject to adjustment based on the inventory balance at closing. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, the Company anticipates the closing of this transaction within the third quarter of 2010.
"The sale of our Aera mass flow controller product line represents a significant step in our strategy to focus our global resources on power conversion," said Dr. Hans Betz, Chief Executive Officer of Advanced Energy. "Our core technology portfolio in power conversion for the semiconductor, flat panel display, solar panel and other thin film markets as well as grid-tied PV inverters is the foundation of our long-term growth strategy. These markets provide tremendous growth opportunities as we continue to develop technologies and scale our business to address them."
At closing, the Company will transfer substantially all of the assets associated with the Aera product lines to Hitachi Metals, Ltd., which will assume certain related liabilities as well as global sales for the Aera product lines. During a transition period, the Company has agreed to provide manufacturing support and certain other services to enable Hitachi Metals, Ltd. to complete the transition without interruption in business flow. Both companies will work to maintain the highest quality service and support throughout the transition for customers using the Aera flow products. It is also contemplated that Hitachi Metals, Ltd. will leverage the Company's worldwide service
 
infrastructure and have the Company become an authorized service provider for Hitachi Metals, Ltd. to service products in all countries other than Japan.
"Hitachi Metals, Ltd. is a highly capable materials manufacturer, and the Aera product lines are complementary to their current business. We are working together to ensure a seamless transition for our mass flow control customers worldwide," continued Dr. Betz.
     "We are very pleased to add the high-quality Aera product line to our product portfolio," said Mr. Hiroyuki Fujii, Executive President of Hitachi Metals, Ltd. "This acquisition increases our industry presence in these strategic markets. Advanced Energy has built a great reputation in the semiconductor, flat panel display and solar panel market, and it is our honor to acquire these products and carry forward the strong heritage of the Aera product line."
The Aera product lines had sales of $11.9 million in the first quarter of 2010 and $15.1 million in the second quarter of 2010. As a result of the sale, the Company's assets are classified as held for sale on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2010, and results from continuing operations will be reduced by the revenue and costs associated with the mass flow controller business and will be included in the discontinued operations line on the income statement. Further financial detail regarding the amounts related to the mass flow controller business are included in the financial tables attached.
GCA Savvian served as the financial advisor and provided a fairness opinion to Advanced Energy related to the transaction.

"Our recent acquisition of PV Powered contributed significantly to our higher inverter revenues and backlog, which we anticipate will provide momentum for the second half of 2010. PV Powered also contributed to our bottom line, delivering a profitable second quarter ahead of expectations and making the acquisition immediately accretive. The addition of this excellent team and product line to our Solaron inverter business positions us to forge ahead and take the leading position in the US market for inverters and expand worldwide."
"Additionally, today we announced that we are divesting our flow business. We see this move as a crucial part of our corporate strategy to focus the company on becoming the market leader in power conversion and capitalize on future growth opportunities."
Semiconductor sales rose 9.9% sequentially to $53.5 million, representing 46.4% of total sales for the quarter. Sales to the non-semiconductor thin film markets increased 87.2% sequentially to $35.9 million, representing 31.2% of total sales for the quarter. Inverter sales grew substantially with the addition of PV Powered to $14.4 million to 12.5% of total sales compared to $2.3 million in the first quarter. Service revenue was flat sequentially at $11.4 million, representing 9.9% of total sales for the quarter.
 
Bookings for the second quarter, including $15.3 million for the mass flow controller business, hit a record of $154.3 million, or a 60.0% increase, compared to $96.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.34:1 for the second quarter. Ending backlog for the second quarter increased 52.0% sequentially to $123.6 million, including $14.4 million for the flow business, compared to $81.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2010.
Advanced Energy also announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its flow business, related product lines and all related assets including the real property in Japan to Hitachi Metals, Ltd. for $44 million in cash, subject to an adjustment based on inventory balance at closing. The company anticipates this transaction will close in the third quarter of 2010 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.
As a result of this transaction, the financial results for our flow business will be recorded in discontinued operations on a net basis beginning with the second quarter 2010. These amounts are revenue of $15.1 million, gross profit of $5.3 million, operating expenses of $1.7 million and net income of $2.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the quarter ended June 30, 2010. Comparable results for the flow business for the second quarter of 2009 were revenues of $3.7 million, gross profit of $0.6 million, operating expenses of $1.3 million and a net loss of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. For comparative purposes, the financial results discussed below assume the adjustments for the divestiture have been made.
Excluding the flow business, sales for the second quarter of 2010 increased 43.6% to $100.1 million from $69.7 million in the first quarter of 2010, and up substantially from $31.9 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Gross margin for the second quarter was 44.5%, compared with 41.9% in the first quarter of 2010, as a result of higher revenues and leverage from overhead absorption. This compares to gross margin of 22.8% in the same period last year.
Operating expenses for the second quarter increased to $31.5 million. This increase was significantly driven by the addition of approximately two months of operating costs associated with the acquisition of PV Powered, including an additional $767,000 of amortization of acquired intangible assets.
Second quarter net income from continuing operations was $11.5 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $4.9 million or $0.11 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010. In the same period a year ago, net loss from continuing operations was $16.0 million or a loss of $0.38 per share.
 
Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $128.9 million at the end of the second quarter, versus $163.4 million in the first quarter reflecting the $35 million payment for the PV Powered acquisition.
Third Quarter 2010 Guidance
The Company anticipates third quarter 2010 results from continuing operations, without revenues from the flow business, to be within the following ranges:
Announcement of Agreement to Sell Aera Flow Controller and Related Product Lines to Hitachi Metals, Ltd.
This earnings release should be read in conjunction with our press release regarding the sale of the Aera flow business transaction dated July 21, 2010.

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release         
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010. Total sales for the third quarter were $141.0 million, another record for the company, with earnings of $0.40 per diluted share from continuing operations. The financials highlighted in this release exclude results from the Aeramass flow controller business, which was sold to Hitachi Metals, Ltd. on October 15, 2010. Results for the quarter include a full quarter of operations from PV Powered, Inc.
Fort Collins, Colo., October 31, 2010
"We had another exceptional quarter with all key areas of our business growing significantly. This record performance was highlighted by the sixth straight quarter of growth in semiconductor revenues, significant acceleration of our inverter business, now 27% of sales, and strong operating leverage," said Dr. Hans Betz, chief executive officer. "The aggressive capacity additions and investment in our inverter business have proven very successful, as Advanced Energy was recently ranked #1 in the 3-phase North America solar PV inverter market, according to IMS Research. With the diversification of Advanced Energy into high growth power conversion markets, particularly inverters, we are well positioned to capitalize on future opportunities and expand our business."
Semiconductor sales rose 12.5% sequentially to $49.4 million, representing 35.0% of total sales for the quarter. Sales to the non-semiconductor thin film markets increased 49.8% sequentially to $41.1 million, representing 29.2% of total sales for the quarter. Inverter sales grew substantially to $37.4 million, or 26.5% of total sales compared to $14.4 million in the second quarter. Service revenue also exhibited healthy growth, increasing to $13.2 million, or 9.3% of total sales, compared to $10.7 million last quarter.
Bookings for the third quarter reached a record $160.3 million, increasing 17.2% compared to $136.7 million in the second quarter of 2010. This resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.14:1 for the third quarter. Ending backlog for the third quarter increased 17.7% sequentially to $128.5 million, compared to $109.2 million at the end of the second quarter of 2010.
 
Gross margin for the third quarter was 43.1%, compared with 44.5% in the second quarter of 2010 and 31.9% in the same period last year. The strong growth in inverter revenues this quarter drove inverters to a larger percentage of total sales, pushing margins down in the short-term.
Operating expenses for the third quarter increased to $38.4 million compared to $31.5 million in the second quarter in order to support higher sales volumes, and as a result of an additional full quarter of PV Powered expenses compared to just two months in the second quarter. As a percent of sales, operating costs were 27.2% compared to 31.4% of sales in the prior quarter. Operating costs during the quarter also included $1.2 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets related to the acquisition of PV Powered.
Third quarter net income from continuing operations was $17.6 million or $0. 40 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $11.5 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010. In the same period a year ago, net loss from continuing operations was $8.4 million or a loss of $0.20 per share.
Cash and investments were $112.4 million at the end of the third quarter, compared to $128.9 million in the second quarter due to investment in capital equipment as well as inventory purchases to support our growing backlog of inverter sales.
Fourth Quarter 2010 Guidance
The Company anticipates fourth quarter 2010 results from continuing operations, to be within the following ranges:

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On February 15, 2011, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved amendments to the Companys Leadership Corporate Incentive Plan () for cash bonuses payable in respect of 2011 and later. As previously disclosed, the Company maintains two cash bonus plans: the Leadership Plan and the Employee Corporate Incentive Plan (). The Leadership Plan provides the Companys executive officers and other key leaders with the opportunity to earn cash bonuses based on achievement of corporate performance metrics and individual performance objectives. Participants in the Leadership Plan do not participate in the Employee Plan. As amended, the Leadership Plan provides that, following the end of each fiscal year, the Company will fund a joint bonus pool for awards under the Leadership Plan and the Employee Plan, only if (a) the Companys total revenue for the year equals or exceeds the total revenue set forth in the Companys annual operating plan approved by the Board of Directors, and (b) the Companys operating income for the year exceeds 10% of the Companys total revenue. Achievement of both of these corporate performance metrics is required in order to fund the bonus pool for the Leadership Plan, and achievement of the operating income target only is required to fund the Employee Plan. The amount of the bonus pool for both plans, if a bonus pool is funded, will be equal to 10% of the Companys operating income for the year.
Leadership Plan
Employee Plan
If the bonus pool is funded, any individual bonus payable to an executive officer under the Leadership Plan will be based upon such executive officers (a) pre-established target bonus, (b) annual performance review and (c) achievement of individual performance objectives, subject to consideration of the total size of the bonus pool and the limitation that no participant may receive a bonus greater than 150% of his or her pre-established target bonus.
The pre-established target bonuses for the Companys executive officers under the Leadership Plan are as follows:

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2010. Reporting record revenue, the company posted fourth quarter sales of $148.7 million and earnings of $0.45 per diluted share from continuing operations.
Fort Collins, Colo., February 14, 2011
"2010 was a year of significant accomplishments for Advanced Energy. We responded with speed and flexibility to meet the needs of our customers during this high growth period in the thin film and renewable markets," said Dr. Hans Betz, chief executive officer. "Advanced Energy has become a clear leader in solar inverter solutions. Coupled with our industry-leading thin film products, our expansion into renewables led to our record revenue quarter, as we further penetrated the inverter market."
Sales to the renewable inverter market surged ahead in the fourth quarter, reflecting the wide-ranging applicability of our extended product portfolio. Inverter sales grew substantially to $51.7 million, or 34.8% of total sales this quarter, compared to $37.4 million, or 27% of total sales in the third quarter of 2010. Sales to the non-semiconductor thin film markets were also extremely strong at $43.3 million, or 29.1% of total sales, compared to $41.1 million last quarter. Sales to the semiconductor market were $40.2 million, or 27.0% of sales compared to $49.4 million last quarter. During a seasonally soft quarter, service revenue performed well, roughly flat sequentially at $13.4 million, or 9.0% of total sales, compared to $13.2 million last quarter.
Bookings for the fourth quarter were $113.3 million, compared to $160.3 million in the third quarter of 2010. We entered the fourth quarter with record bookings as inverter customers placed orders for delivery prior to year-end in order to satisfy funding requirements for various federal incentives and grant programs in the US and Europe, many of which were expected to be reduced or ended in 2010, but have since been extended.
Gross margin for the fourth quarter improved sequentially at 43.6% compared to 43.1% in the third quarter of 2010. This was due in large part to the continued decline in warranty costs, reflecting continuous improvement in our product quality. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter increased to $40.8 million compared to $38.4 million in the third quarter in order to support higher sales volumes. Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $19.7 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $17.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2010.
 
Cash and investments were $140.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to $112.4 million in the third quarter of 2010. We generated $34.9 million in cash from operations during the fourth quarter of 2010.
For the full year 2010, sales nearly tripled to $459.4 million, compared to $161.8 million in 2009. Net income from continuing operations for 2010 was $53.6 million or earnings per share of $1.23, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $101.8 million, or a loss per share of $2.43 in 2009.
First Quarter 2011 Guidance
The Company anticipates first quarter 2011 results from continuing operations, to be within the following ranges:

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2011. The company posted first quarter sales of $137.7 million, operating income of 17.7%, and earnings of $0.43 per diluted share from continuing operations.
Fort Collins, Colo., May 2, 2011
"Advanced Energy had another quarter of solid financial and organizational performance. Our strategy to transition the company to a diversified business model paid dividends this quarter as increased shipments in our thin films business minimized the seasonality of our renewables business," said Dr. Hans Betz, chief executive officer.
Total revenue of $137.7 million was split between Thin Films at $100.1 million and $37.6 million in the Renewables Business Unit. Thin films sales were primarily driven by strength in the semiconductor market. Renewables sales were impacted by the North American market first quarter seasonality, but delivered record bookings of $65.5 million for the quarter.
"We are very excited about our announcement today that our inverters have been chosen for two major Utility projects: a 150MW project with Zachry in Arizona and a 35MW project in California with Cupertino Electric, demonstrating the differentiated reliability and efficiency of our inverters and the subsequent impact on the levelized cost of energy. We are seeing a growing number of larger, Utility scale projects as the solar market continues its expansion," said Dr. Hans Betz, chief executive officer.
Operating income grew to $24.4 million or 17.7% of revenue, the 8 consecutive quarter of improved operating results. This continued strength was the result of our aggressive management of operating expenses as we
th
 
continue to refine our strategic business units. Net income from continuing operations was $18.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $19.7 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. This decline was due to an increase in the company's effective tax rate to 25% in the first quarter of 2011 from 19% in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Bookings for the first quarter were $184.0 million, compared to $83.2 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Thin Films Business Unit
Thin Films business unit sales climbed to $100.1 million versus $67.4 million in the same period of 2010, a 49% improvement year over year. This growth reflects the continued strength in the semiconductor industry and demonstrated our strength in advanced power solutions for Etch and Deposition applications. We also benefitted from another strong quarter in the solar panel and glass market as we continue to leverage our leading position in crystalline silicon processing equipment and strategic customer relationships to address the current growth in China.
Renewables Business Unit
Renewables business unit sales were $37.6 million in the quarter versus $2.3 million in the same period of 2010. This significant year over year improvement reflects the acquisition of PV Powered as well continued growth of the North American solar market. Our focus on building a leading position in the strategic commercial and Utility segments of the inverter market continued this quarter with record bookings reflecting the many growth opportunities ahead.
Second Quarter 2011 Guidance
The Company anticipates second quarter 2011 results from continuing operations, to be within the following ranges:

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today updated its outlook for the quarter ended June 30, 2011. Based on preliminary financial data, the company now expects to report revenue between $137 million and $140 million for the second quarter of 2011, below the range of $148 million to $160 million it projected on May 2, 2011, and earnings at the low end of, or slightly lower than the range it projected on May 2, 2011.
Fort Collins, Colo., July 5, 2011
"The performance of our renewables business drove our lower than expected second quarter revenue, while our thin film business performed in-line with our expectations. Our results were primarily impacted by changing solar market conditions driven by panel price declines, short lead-times for components, and permitting and financing delays. These trends are causing some customers to push-out purchases until panel prices stabilize, leading to the postponement of construction of their projects. Additionally, changing incentive programs in certain regions, coupled with increasing competition, affected the quarter and continue to be ongoing industry dynamics. While we are disappointed in our renewables results this quarter, our recently-announced large project wins reinforce our confidence in our strategy of selling based on LCOE (levelized cost of energy), which we believe will continue to differentiate us from our competitors," said Dr. Hans Betz, chief executive officer.
Second Quarter 2011 Conference Call

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011. The company posted second quarter sales of $138.2 million, operating income of 12.5%, and earnings of $0.31 per diluted share from continuing operations.
Fort Collins, Colo., July 25, 2011
"Our renewables business in the second quarter was pressured by several industry dynamics, including declining panel prices, increasing competition, and changing incentive programs, which impacted our results more than anticipated. We were nonetheless pleased that our thin films business unit was in-line with expectations," said Dr. Hans Betz, chief executive officer. "Looking at our expectations for the remainder of 2011, we believe the benefits of our diversification strategy become clear. As our thin film business softens with market cyclicality, our renewables business is poised to capture previously-deferred business as customers initiate projects in order to take advantage of tax credits by year-end. Longer-term, we continue to see demand for our utility-scale inverter products in North America and remain confident that Advanced Energy's strategy of selling based on levelized cost of energy (LCOE), superior uptime performance and best-in-class service offering will continue to differentiate us in the market"
Thin Film Business Unit
Thin Films business unit sales were $97.3 million versus $85.7 million in the same period of 2010, a 13.5% improvement year over year. Total Thin Film sales met our expectations this quarter, although declined slightly on a sequential basis from $100.1 million in the first quarter of 2011. Strength in our flat panel display market this quarter was somewhat offset by the initial signs of a pause in semiconductor capital spending, as well as the overcapacity and resulting price declines in the solar panel industry.
 
Renewables Business Unit
Renewables business unit sales were $40.8 million in the quarter versus $14.4 million in the same period of 2010. The significant year-over-year improvement reflects the acquisition of PV Powered and the ongoing growth of the North American solar equipment market. Renewable sales were impacted by several industry dynamics during the quarter, leading to slower than anticipated sequential growth of 9%.
Operating income was $17.3 million or 12.5% of revenue. Net income from continuing operations was $13.5 million or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to net income from continuing operations of $18.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011.
Bookings for the second quarter were $101.7 million.

The Company anticipates third quarter 2011 results from continuing operations, to be within the following ranges:

Change in Control Agreement with Dr. Rogerson
On August 4, 2011, the Company entered into an Executive Change of Control Agreement with Dr. Garry W. Rogerson (the "CIC Agreement"), which became effective upon Dr. Rogerson commencing his service as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The CIC Agreement provides Dr. Rogerson with severance payments and certain benefits in the event of his Involuntary Termination. An "Involuntary Termination" will be deemed to have occurred if Dr. Rogerson's employment is terminated at the time of or following a Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Agreement) before the end of the CIC Period (as defined in the CIC Agreement) (i) by the Company without Cause (as defined in the CIC Agreement) or (ii) by Dr. Rogerson for Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Agreement). Any amounts payable to Dr. Rogerson pursuant to the CIC Agreement, except for any Accrued Compensation (as defined in the CIC Agreement), will be contingent on Dr. Rogerson's provision to the Company of a release of claims.
In the event of termination of Dr. Rogerson's employment under circumstances constituting an Involuntary Termination, he will be entitled to receive: (a) all then accrued compensation and a pro-rata portion of executive's target bonus for the year in which the termination is effected, (b) a lump sum payment equal to (i) 2 times his then current annual base salary plus (ii) his target bonus for the year in which the termination is effected, (c) continuation of benefits for 18 months following the period for revocation of the release, unless Dr. Rogerson commences employment with another employer, (d) an amount equal to the contributions that would have been made to the Company's retirement plans on his behalf, if he had continued to be employed for 12 months following the period for revocation of the release, and (e) reimbursement, up to $15,000, for outplacement services.
Dr. Rogerson's Options and RSUs (each as defined in the CIC Agreement) will also accelerate in full upon an Involuntary Termination following a Change in Control before the end of the CIC Period. The termination of Dr. Rogerson's employment without Cause during a Pending Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Agreement) will not accelerate the vesting of Options or RSUs held by Dr. Rogerson, unless the Change in Control is effected within 3 months following the Date of Termination (as defined in the CIC Agreement), in which case Dr. Rogerson's Options will vest in full.
The foregoing is a summary of the material terms of the CIC Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the CIC Agreement. A copy of the complete CIC Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and the terms the CIC Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference.
Director Indemnification Agreement with Dr. Rogerson
On August 4, 2011, the Company entered into a Director Indemnification Agreement in the Company's standard form (the "Indemnification Agreement") with Dr. Rogerson.
The Indemnification Agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to exceptions specified in the Indemnification Agreement, the Company shall hold harmless and indemnify Dr. Rogerson and advance expenses incurred by Dr. Rogerson, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, in connection with any proceeding covered by the Indemnification Agreement. The Company's obligations under the Indemnification Agreement shall continue following the time that Dr. Rogerson ceases to be a director of the Company, so long as Dr. Rogerson is subject to any proceeding covered by the Indemnification Agreement.
The rights of indemnification provided by the Indemnification Agreement are not exclusive and specifically supplement the rights to indemnification provided to the directors in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and applicable law. To the extent that the Company maintains one or more insurance policies providing liability insurance for its directors, officers, employees, agents or fiduciaries, Dr. Rogerson shall be covered by such policy or policies in accordance with the terms thereof. In the event of any payment by the Company under the Indemnification Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of Dr. Rogerson.
The form of Indemnification Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 14, 2009.

Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the "Company") announced today that as part of its long-term strategic plan, the Company is implementing several initiatives to further its long-term globalization strategy. In order to foster growth and enhance profitability, the Company is beginning with the alignment of its manufacturing and R&D resources. The Company committed to the initiatives on September 27, 2011 and expects the initial actions will be completed in the third quarter of 2011.
Under the plan, Advanced Energy will align its engineering resources with the geographic footprint of its customer base. By localizing R&D within the major geographies it serves, the Company will improve its time to market and distance to key customers, creating a more highly-focused and responsive development team. In addition, by leveraging its successful manufacturing operation in China, the Company will transition the manufacture of certain solar inverter subcomponents to its Shenzhen factory. This will lower product costs for its solar energy business worldwide and enable regional fulfillment for complete products in the growing Asian market. The final assembly and testing of solar inverter products in the Company's other markets such as North America will remain in close proximity to each region's customers. Collectively, these steps will enable the Company to more efficiently use its resources to bolster its financial results and better manage the cyclicality of its markets. The aim is to lower fixed costs for the Company going forward.
The first step of this restructuring will be a reduction of the Company's workforce, primarily in the thin films business unit, resulting in annual savings of approximately $6 million. The affected employees have been notified and the Company anticipates a smooth transition. As a result of the reduction, the Company expects to take a charge in the third quarter related to the restructuring of approximately $2.5 to $3.5 million.
Secondly, over the next 12-18 months, the Company will continue to evaluate its cost structure as it closes facilities and relocates certain functions to different regions worldwide. As a result, the Company anticipates further charges in the amount of $8 to $12 million, principally for space consolidation, and another $1 million in additional severance costs over this timeframe. Consequently, the Company expects total charges of $12 to $16 million for the initiatives announced today, approximately $9 to $13 million of which will be cash expenditures. The actions taken today as well as other cost savings initiatives and margin improvements are expected to deliver annual savings of approximately $16 to $20 million.
The Company issued a press release on September 28, 2011, announcing the restructuring plan, a copy of which is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
The expected $2.5 to $3.5 million charge in connection with the reduction of the Company's workforce as part of the restructuring was not anticipated at the time the Company provided guidance on July 25, 2011. Although the Company has yet to close the quarter, the Company expects to be at or slightly below the low end of earnings guidance, and with the charge this quarter expects to be below earnings guidance.
The Company issued a press release on September 28, 2011, announcing the restructuring plan and the related charge, a copy of which is attached to this Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.

"After two months at Advanced Energy, I continue to be impressed with the company's strong leadership in the power conversion market," said Garry Rogerson, chief executive officer. "The currently challenging environment in the end markets served by both the thin films and solar business units has prompted us to move forward on implementing our long-term strategic plan, which will be discussed at our upcoming analyst event. The initiatives announced today position us closer to our customers in high growth markets worldwide. We expect this will contribute to greater profitability and flexibility during the cyclical peaks and troughs of the thin films business. This will better position us to invest in strategic growth areas and remain at the forefront of the industry."
 
The first step of this restructuring will be a reduction of the company's workforce, primarily in the thin films business unit, resulting in annual savings of approximately $6 million.

Although we have yet to close the quarter, at this point we expect to be at or slightly below the low end of our earnings guidance, and with the charge this quarter we expect to be below our earnings guidance.
Secondly, over the next 12-18 months, the company will continue to evaluate its cost structure as it closes facilities and relocates certain functions to different regions worldwide. As a result, the company anticipates further charges in the amount of $8 to $12 million, principally for space consolidation, and another $1 million in additional severance costs over this timeframe. Consequently, we expect total charges of $12 to $16 million for the initiatives announced today, approximately $9 to $13 million of which will be cash expenditures. The actions taken today as well as other cost savings initiatives and margin improvements are expected to deliver annual savings of approximately $16 to $20 million.

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011. The company posted third quarter sales of $128.5 million, operating income of 8.3% of sales and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.16. On a non-GAAP basis, income generated from operations was 10.7% of sales and earnings from our continuing operations on a per share basis were $0.21. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of the previously-announced $3.1 million restructuring charge recorded in the third quarter. A reconciliation of non-GAAP income from operations and per share earnings is provided in the tables.
Fort Collins, Colo., November 1, 2011
"Tenuous macroeconomic conditions coupled with continuing declines in capital equipment spending pressured our Thin Films business this quarter. We continue to see revenue growth in our Solar Energy business as orders increased and the deployment of our previously announced utility scale projects continued," said Garry Rogerson, chief executive officer. "By taking pro-active measures to re-align our resources and cost structure, Advanced Energy will be better positioned to make strategic investments that we expect will extend our leadership and improve profitability in the future. During the quarter, cash increased by $9 million as working capital declined during the quarter."
Thin Films Business Unit
Thin Films business unit sales were $76.8 million versus $103.6 million in the third quarter of 2010. On a sequential basis, Thin Films sales declined 21.1% from $97.3 million in the second quarter of 2011. Industry conditions across most of the company's thin films end markets weakened this quarter. Semiconductor equipment sales slowed as manufacturers limited purchases due to low fab utilization rates. The thin film renewables market continued to experience panel overcapacity and pricing pressure, while the flat panel display market is undergoing a pause in investment as capacity comes on line.
 
Solar Energy Business Unit
Solar Energy business unit sales were $51.7 million in the quarter versus $37.4 million in the same period of 2010. On a sequential basis, Solar Energy sales increased 26.7% from $40.8 million in the second quarter of 2011. Despite the solar panel industry's struggle with significant oversupply and ongoing price declines, inverter sales grew once again this quarter due to utility-scale shipments from large projects wins announced earlier this year.
Income from Continuing Operations
Income from continuing operations was $7.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $17.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share in the same period last year. Income from continuing operations was $13.5 million or $0.31 in the second quarter of 2011. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the restructuring charge, continuing operations generated income for the quarter of $9.3 million or $0.21 per share.
Restructuring Charge
The restructuring charge incurred in the quarter related to the restructuring plan that was announced on September 28, 2011. Under the first phase of the plan, Advanced Energy will align its engineering resources with the geographic footprint of its customer base. By localizing R&D within the major geographies it serves, the company will improve its time to market and distance to key customers, creating a more highly-focused and responsive development team. The company will also transition the manufacture of certain solar inverter subcomponents to its Shenzhen factory. This will lower product costs for its Solar Energy business worldwide and enable regional fulfillment for complete products in the growing Asian market. The anticipated savings from the restructuring are approximately $6 million annually for the first phase.
The second phase will be implemented over the next 12 to 18 months as the company reduces its cost structure, closes facilities and relocates certain functions to different regions worldwide. As a result, the company anticipates further charges in the amount of $8 to $12 million, principally for space consolidation, and another $1 million in additional severance costs over this timeframe. Once complete, these two phases of the restructuring plan, along with other cost savings initiatives and margin improvements, are expected to deliver annual savings of approximately $16 to $20 million.
 
Fourth Quarter 2011 Guidance
The Company anticipates fourth quarter 2011 results from continuing operations, to be within the following ranges:

Background
As part of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.'s (the "Company's") focus on delivering improved shareholder value, the Company redesigned its executive compensation plans to more closely align executive compensation with shareholders interests and reinforce a "Pay for Performance Culture". The new compensation plans are integrated into the Company's 20122014 strategic plan and provide incentives designed to align the executive officers' performance with the interests of the Company's shareholders and also encourage retention. In particular, awards will only vest based on Company and business unit financial measures being attained or exceeded. Participation in these new plans, which replace the Company's Leadership Corporate Incentive Plan, Employee Corporate Incentive Plan and annual equity grants program, is more limited than the prior plans.
On December 6, 2011, the Company's Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved (1) the 2012-2014 Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTI Plan") which covers three one-year performance periods, and (2) the Short Term Incentive Plan ("STI Plan") which covers annual performance periods, starting in 2012.
All of the Company's executive officers have been selected to participate in the LTI Plan and STI Plan.
LTI Plan
The LTI Plan is a performance-based equity plan under the Company 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2008 Plan"), with awards vesting based upon the return on net assets achieved by the Company during each year of the LTI Plan. For executive officers who participate in the LTI Plan, awards will vest each year as to equity with an approximate grant date value (used for internal compensation determination purposes) of $525,000, which is referred to in the plan as the "target amount," if the Company achieves the target return on net assets determined under the applicable annual operating plan approved by the Board of Directors ("RONA Target"). Such vested awards will consist of (1) performance units that the Compensation Committee can elect to settle in performance stock or cash (which cash would be equivalent to the market value of such performance stock at the time of vesting), or a combination thereof, representing 70% of the target amount, and (2) performance stock options representing 30% of the target amount.
 
The LTI Plan provides for minimum vesting of 50% of the target amount of each award, so long as the Company has positive operating income for the fiscal year. The awards will vest as to more than 50% of the target amount, based on a formula set forth in the plan, if and to the extent the Company exceeds a specified minimum return on net assets threshold (which is less than the RONA Target), but in no event will the awards vest as to more than 200% of their target amounts.
The performance units will be evidenced by award letters given to the executive officers and other key members of management who are selected to participate in the LTI Plan. The award letters will provide for the vesting of performance shares as set forth above, and settlement in cash, stock (or a combination thereof), as determined by the Compensation Committee, after the Company's return on net assets has been calculated for such year, which is expected to occur in the first quarters of 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Performance stock options will be granted to each of the participants on January 3, 2012, in respect of the maximum number of shares issuable to the participant over the life of the LTI Plan, but such options will only vest as set forth above and in accordance with the other terms of the LTI Plan. The exercise price of such performance stock options will be equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date. If the Company does not meet the performance targets in a given year, the options for that year will expire.
Awards under the LTI plan are subject to other terms and conditions outlined in the LTI Plan.
 
STI Plan
The STI Plan provides the Company's executive officers and other key members of management who are selected to participate in the STI Plan with the opportunity to earn a cash bonus based on achievement of weighted performance metrics of revenue, operating income and cash flow for the Thin Films business unit, Solar Energy business unit and/or Company as a whole, as determined for each participant. If the performance metrics for the participants are not met, but the Company meets a specified minimum threshold of cash flow for the fiscal year, the terms of the STI Plan provide for an award of up to 40% of the pre-established target bonus to each participant, based on the formula set forth in the STI Plan.
The pre-established target bonus under the STI Plan for Garry Rogerson, Chief Executive Officer, is equal to 100% of his base salary. The pre-established target bonuses under the STI Plan for each of Yuval Wasserman, President of Thin Films Business Unit, Danny Herron, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Thomas McGimpsey, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and General Counsel is equal to 75% of such executive officer's base salary. The target bonuses will be paid to these executive officers if the Company achieves the revenue, operating income and cash flow set forth in the annual operating plan approved by the Board of Directors. If the Company exceeds these performance metrics, a cash bonus greater than the target amount may become payable to a participant, up to a maximum of 200% of the target bonus.
Awards under the STI Plan are subject to other terms and conditions including funding of such plan.
Item 8.01 Other Events.
On December 7, 2011, Douglas S. Schatz, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, and his wife Jill E. Schatz, as trustees of The Douglas S. Schatz and Jill E. Schatz Family Trust U/A DTD 3/26/02 (the " Trust"), adopted a selling plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Plan"), which provides for the sale of up to $8,000,000 of common stock of the Company beginning February 2, 2012. Shares will be sold under the Plan on the open market at prevailing market prices and subject to minimum price thresholds specified in the Plan. The Plan will terminate no later than May 18, 2012, even if all shares subject to the Plan have not been sold. The Plan was established as part of Mr. and Mrs. Schatz's personal long-term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity.
The Company does not undertake to report Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any officers or directors in the future, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced trading plan, except to the extent required by law.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Tenant acknowledges that the appearance of the Leased Premises is an essential element of the appearance of the Building.
Janitorial Services
 
k. .

Inspection of and Right of Entry to Leased Premises  Regular, Emergency, Re-letting
18. . Unless Landlord's approval is first secured in writing (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Tenant shall not install or erect inside partitions, add to existing electric power service, add telephone outlets, install additional heating and/or air conditioning or make any other changes, alterations or improvements to the interior or exterior of the Leased Premises or the Building. Upon requesting any such consent, Tenant shall provide to Landlord all information reasonably necessary to permit Landlord to properly assess the proposed work, including, without limitation, a reasonably detailed description of the proposed work and the estimated cost thereof. Landlord shall consent to or reject any such proposed work that is nonstructural in nature within ten (10) days following Tenant's request for consent; and Landlord shall consent to or reject any proposed work that is structural in nature within ten (10) days following Tenant's request for consent. Any such changes or alterations shall be made at the sole cost and expense of Tenant. At the end of this Lease, all such fixtures, equipment, additions, changes and/or alterations (except trade fixtures installed by Tenant) shall be and remain the property of Landlord; provided, however, Landlord shall have the option to require Tenant to remove any or all such fixtures, equipment, additions and/or alterations and restore the Leased Premises to the condition existing immediately prior to such change and/or installation, normal wear and tear excepted, all at Tenant's cost and expense. Landlord shall inform Tenant of Landlord's request to Tenant to restore the Premises at time of consent. Landlord and tenant agree that all current additions and or alterations have been approved by the landlord and Tenant will not be required to remove any or all such fixtures, equipment, additions and/or alterations and restore the Leased Premises. All such work shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and shall consist of new materials unless agreed to otherwise by Landlord. Landlord may require adequate security from Tenant assuring no mechanics' liens on account of work done on the Leased Premises by Tenant and may post the Leased Premises, or take such other action as is then permitted by law, to protect Landlord and the Leased Premises against mechanics' liens. Tenant agrees to pay or cause to be paid promptly all bills and charges for any material, labor or otherwise in connection with or arising out of any such alterations, improvements or additions to the Leased Premises, and Tenant agrees to hold Landlord free and harmless against all liens and claims of liens for labor and materials, or either of them, filed against the Leased Premises, or any part thereof, and against any expense or liability in connection therewith. Tenant shall, however, have the right to contest any mechanic's liens or claims of such liens filed against the Leased Premises, provided Tenant shall diligently prosecute any such contest and at all times effectively stay or prevent any sale of the Leased Premises under execution or otherwise and pay or otherwise satisfy any final judgment judging or enforcing such contested lien and thereafter procure record of satisfaction or release thereof. Landlord shall also retain the right, but shall not have an obligation, to post the Leased Premises or take such other action as is then permitted by law to protect Landlord and the Leased Premises against mechanic's liens. Any such work done within the Leased Premises by Tenant shall be accomplished in accordance with all applicable governmental laws, rules, regulations and ordinances, including, without limitation, any requirements imposed by the American with Disabilities Act (or similar applicable legislation), all at the sole cost and expense of Tenant. Without limiting any other provisions of this Lease, Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole cost and expense (but subject to Landlord's prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), make each and every alteration or addition to the Leased Premises required to bring the Leased Premises into compliance with the requirements imposed by the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.  12101, ) and any regulations promulgated pursuant thereto effective from time to time during the term of this Lease, and any period of holding over by Tenant ("ADA Requirements"), if:
Alteration  Changes and Additions  Responsibility
et seq.
a. The requirement for such alteration or addition arises as a result of:
i. Any alteration or addition by Tenant.
ii. Any violation by Tenant of any ADA Requirements.
iii. A special use of the Leased Premises or any part thereof by Tenant or any assignee or subtenant of Tenant (including, but not limited to, use for a facility which constitutes, or if open to the public generally would constitute, a "place of public accommodation" under the ADA Requirements).
iv. The special needs of the employee(s) of Tenant or any assignee or subtenant of Tenant.
b. The ADA Requirements would otherwise make Tenant rather than Landlord primarily responsible for making such alteration or addition.
c. Tenant shall not be required to perform or pay for any upgrades outside of the Leased Premises to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C.  12101, ).
et seq.
19. . Except for signs which are located inside of the Leased Premises and which are not attached to any part of the Leased Premises, Landlord must approve in writing any sign to be placed in or on the interior or exterior of the Leased Premises, regardless of size or value. Specifically, signs attached to windows of the Leased Premises must be so approved by Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. As a condition to the
Sign Approval
 
granting of such approval, Landlord shall have the right to require Tenant to furnish a bond or other security acceptable to Landlord sufficient to insure completion of and payment for any such sign work to be so performed. Tenant shall, during the entire Lease Term, maintain Tenant's signs in good condition and repair at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Tenant shall, remove all signs at the termination of this Lease, at Tenant's sole risk and expense and shall in a workmanlike manner properly repair any damage and close any holes caused by the installation and/or removal of Tenant's signs. Tenant shall give Landlord prior notice of such removal so that a representative of Landlord shall have the opportunity of being present when the signage is removed, or shall pre-approve the manner and materials used to repair damage and close the holes caused by removal. Tenant's existing monument and building signs have been approved by the landlord and will remain in place for the term of the lease and any extensions thereof, except in the event of development of Lot 5, in which case Landlord reserves the right, at its own expense, to remove the existing monument sign should that become necessary. In the event such development includes a multi-tenant directory sign listing other business park tenants, then Tenant shall be allowed, at its pro-rata cost, to be included on the sign.
20. . In the event the Leased Premises and/or the Building of which the Leased Premises are a part shall be totally destroyed by fire or other casualty or so badly damaged that, in the opinion of Landlord, it is not feasible to repair or rebuild same, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Tenant and all obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall cease. If the Leased Premises are partially damaged by fire or other casualty, except if caused by Tenant's negligence, and said Leased Premises are not rendered untenable thereby, as determined by Landlord, an appropriate reduction of the rent shall be allowed for the unoccupied portion of the Leased Premises until repair thereof shall be substantially completed. If Landlord elects to exercise the right herein vested in it to terminate this Lease as a result of damage to or destruction of the Leased Premises or the Building in which the Leased Premises are located, said election shall be made by giving notice thereof to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the date of said damage or destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall not have any obligation whatsoever to repair, reconstruct or restore the Leased Premises or the Building when the damage resulting from any casualty covered under this Lease occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the term or any renewal term. Any option to renew this Lease that Tenant may be entitled to exercise shall be null and void if such option has not been exercised prior to any such casualty that occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the term or any renewal term and Landlord elects not to repair, reconstruct or restore the Leased Premises or the Building.
Damage or Destruction of Leased Premises
Such restoration by Landlord shall not include replacement of Tenant's trade fixtures, furniture, equipment or other items that do not become part of the Building or any improvements to the Leased Premises in excess of those provided for in the allowance (if any) for building standard items as of the Commencement Date of this Lease. Restoration of the Leased Premises required beyond Landlord's obligation shall be performed by Tenant at no cost to Landlord. Tenant agrees that during any period of reconstruction or repair of the Leased Premises to continue the operation of business in the Leased Premises to the extent reasonably practicable. The Base Rent shall be abated or reduced proportionately to the proportion of the Leased Premises that has been damaged or destroyed during any period in which, by reason of such damage or destruction, there is a substantial interference with the operation of Tenant's business.
21. . The parties agree that Landlord shall have complete freedom of negotiation and settlement of all matters pertaining to the acquisition of the Leased Premises, the Building, the Area, or any part thereof, by any governmental body or other person or entity via the exercise of the power of eminent domain, it being understood and agreed that any financial settlement made or compensation paid respecting said land or improvements to be so taken, whether resulting from negotiation and agreement or legal proceedings, shall be the exclusive property of Landlord, there being no sharing whatsoever between Landlord and Tenant of any sum so paid. In the event of any such taking, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease on the date possession is delivered to the condemning person or authority and all obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall cease. Such taking of the property shall not be a breach of this Lease by Landlord nor give rise to any claims in Tenant for damages or compensation from Landlord. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as depriving Tenant of the right to retain as its sole property any compensation paid for any tangible personal property owned by Tenant which is taken in any such condemnation proceeding.
Governmental Acquisition of Property
If a taking of the Leased Premises, the Building, or any part thereof pursuant to the above provisions occurs as to less than substantially all of the Leased Premises and Tenant can reasonably operate on the remainder of the Leased Premises the business being conducted on the Leased Premises at the time of such taking, this Lease shall not terminate and the monthly rental thereafter due and payable by Tenant shall be reduced in such proportion as the value of the whole of the Leased Premises shall be reduced as a result of such taking. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree whether substantially all of the Leased Premises has been taken as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, or the amount by which the monthly rental should be reduced, such question shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The decision of such arbitration shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties thereto, and all fees and expenses of such arbitration (exclusive of attorneys' fees) shall be shared by the parties thereto. If a taking of more than 50% of the Leased Premises occurs and Tenant cannot reasonably operate in the remainder of the Leased Premises the business being conducted on the Leased Premises at the time of such taking, Tenant shall have the option to terminate this lease with thirty (30) days' notice. Such taking of the property shall not be a breach of this Lease by Landlord nor give rise to any claims in Tenant for damages or compensation from Landlord.
22. . Tenant may not assign this Lease (whether voluntary or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise), or sublet the Leased Premises or any part thereof, without the written consent of Landlord, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. No such assignment or subletting if approved by Landlord shall
Assignment or Subletting
 
relieve Tenant of any of its obligations hereunder, and, the performance or nonperformance of any of the covenants herein contained by subtenants shall be considered as the performance or the nonperformance by Tenant. A merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all (50% or more) of the assets of Tenant or a transfer of a substantial ownership interest (50% or more) in Tenant, except for transfers by will or otherwise upon death, shall constitute an assignment of this Lease for the purpose of this paragraph. Any consent to assignment or subletting given by Landlord shall not constitute a waiver of necessity for such consent to a subsequent assignment or subletting. Notwithstanding any assignment or sublease, Tenant and all Guarantors shall remain fully liable under the terms and conditions of this Lease and shall not be released from performing any of the terms, covenants and conditions hereof. Any assignee or subtenant (in addition to Tenant) shall be personally responsible for all payments, conditions, covenants and agreements contained in or provided by this Lease. Any assignment or subletting in violation of this paragraph 21 shall be null and void, and at Landlord's option, shall constitute a default under this Lease.
Tenant hereby assigns and transfers to Landlord all of Tenant's interest in all rentals and income arising from any sublease made by Tenant, and Landlord may collect such rent and income and apply same toward Tenant's obligations under this Lease. Landlord shall not, by reason of this or any other assignment of such sublease to Landlord nor by reason of the collection of the rents from a subtenant, be deemed liable to the subtenant for any failure of Tenant to perform and comply with any of Tenant's obligations to such subtenant under such sublease. Tenant hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs any such subtenant, upon receipt of a written notice from Landlord stating that a default exists in the performance of Tenant's obligations under this Lease, to pay to Landlord the rents due and to become due under the sublease. Tenant agrees that such subtenant shall have the right to rely upon any such statement and request from Landlord, and that such subtenant shall pay such rents to Landlord without any obligation or right to inquire as to whether such default exists and notwithstanding any notice from or claim from Tenant to the contrary. Tenant shall have no right or claim against said subtenant or Landlord for any such rents so paid by said subtenant to Landlord.
No sublease entered into by Tenant shall be effective unless and until it has been approved in writing by Landlord. In entering into any sublease, Tenant shall use only such form of sublease as is reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, and once approved by Landlord, such sublease shall not be changed or modified without Landlord's prior written consent. Any subtenant shall, by reason of entering into a sublease under this Lease, be deemed, for the benefit of Landlord, to have assumed and agreed to conform and comply with each and every obligation herein to be performed by Tenant other than such obligations as are contrary to or inconsistent with provisions contained in a sublease to which Landlord has expressly consented in writing. No subtenant shall further assign or sublet all or any part of the Leased Premises without Landlord's prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
In any situation in which Landlord consents to an assignment or sublease hereunder, Tenant shall promptly deliver to Landlord a fully executed copy of the final sublease agreement or assignment instrument and all ancillary agreements relating thereto. No assignment shall be effective unless the assignee has agreed within the assignment instrument to assume the obligations of Tenant hereunder and to be personally bound by all of the covenants, terms and conditions hereof on the part of Tenant to be performed or observed hereunder.
If Tenant shall assign or sublet the Premises or request the consent of Landlord to any assignment or subletting or if Tenant shall request the consent of Landlord for any act Tenant proposes to do then Tenant shall pay Landlord's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including attorneys, architects', engineers' or other consultants' fees. In addition, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, all reasonable additional direct and indirect expenses incurred by Landlord due to any such assignee or sublessee taking possession of the Premises, including, but not limited to, freight elevator operation, security service, janitorial service and rubbish removal.
Landlord reserves the right to condition any approval to assign or sublet upon Landlord's determination that (i) the proposed assignee or subtenant shall conduct a business on the Premises of a quality substantially equal to that of Tenant and consistent with the general character of the other occupants of the Building, and (ii) the proposed assignee or subtenant be financially responsible.
Tenant shall have an unrestricted right, at any time during the lease term or any extension period, without Landlord's approval, to assign the lease or to sublease all or any portion of the Premises to any successor organization (defined as a parent, subsidiary or affiliated entity resulting from a merger, acquisition or reorganization of Tenant).
23. . Tenant's request of Landlord's consent to an assignment of this Lease or a subletting of all or any part of the Leased Premises shall contain a written offer to Landlord to recapture the Leased Premises (or the portion thereof proposed to be sublet, in the case of a subletting), at the lesser of (i) the then current rental in effect under this Lease; or (ii) the rental Tenant proposes to obtain as a result of the assignment or sublease. Upon receipt of such written offer, Landlord shall have the option, to be exercised within ten (10) days following receipt of such offer, to accept the offer to recapture in accordance with this paragraph. If such offer is accepted by Landlord, Tenant shall execute an assignment of the Lease or a sublease to Landlord in a form acceptable to Landlord, with Landlord having the right to sublease the portion of the Leased Premises affected to others without any requirement of obtaining Tenant's consent therefore. Except as hereafter provided, Tenant shall not be relieved of its liability under this Lease. If Landlord exercises its option to recapture and the assignment or sublease from Tenant provides for a rental rate equal to the rental rate in effect as of the date the option is exercised, Tenant shall be released of all further liability under this Lease as of the effective date of the assignment or sublease with respect to that portion of the Leased Premises subject to the assignment or sublease. If Landlord does not exercise its option within the time herein specified and consents in writing to Tenant's request to assign or sublease, Tenant shall, in a form acceptable to Landlord, assign or sublease to the assignee or subtenant named in Tenant's request within thirty (30) days from the date of Tenant's request at a rental rate equal to the rental rate specified in the request. In the event Tenant fails to execute and deliver any assignment or sublease within thirty (30) days from the date of Tenant's request, then Tenant shall again comply with all the provision and conditions of this paragraph before assigning this Lease or subletting all or any portion of the Leased Premises.
Recapture of Leased Premises
 
24. Tenant agrees that this Lease shall be subordinate to any mortgages, trust deeds or ground leases that may now exist or which may hereafter be placed upon said Leased Premises and to any and all advances to be made thereunder, and to the interest thereon, and all renewals, replacements and extensions thereof. This provision is intended to be self-effectuating and no separate instrument or subordination is required to rely on this subordination. However, Tenant shall execute and deliver whatever instruments may be required for the above purposes, which instruments shall include Non-Disturbance provisions. Tenant shall in the event of the sale or assignment of Landlord's interest in the Area or in the Building of which the Leased Premises form a part, or in the event of any proceedings brought for the foreclosure of or in the event of exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage made by Landlord covering the Leased Premises, attorn to the purchaser and recognize such purchaser as Landlord under this Lease. Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Tenant, a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement in the form set forth above, executed by State Farm Insurance.
Subordination.
25. . If any mortgages, deeds of trust or ground leases are enforced by the mortgagee, trustee or ground lessor, Tenant shall, upon request, attorn to such mortgagee or purchaser at such foreclosure sale, ground lessor or any person or party succeeding to the interest of Landlord as a result of such enforcement, as the case may be, and execute instrument(s) confirming such attornment; provided, however, that if this Lease was approved and accepted in writing by such mortgagee, trustee or lessor, Tenant's attornment shall be conditioned upon the agreement by such successor to Landlord's interest not to disturb Tenant's possession hereunder during the term of this Lease so long as Tenant performs its obligations under this Lease. In the event of such enforcement and upon Tenant's attornment as aforesaid, Tenant will automatically become the tenant of the successor to Landlord's interest without change in the terms or provisions of this Lease; provided, however, that such successor to Landlord's interest shall not be bound by (a) any payment of Base Rent for more than one (1) month in advance, or (b) any amendments or modifications of this Lease made without the prior written consent of such mortgagee, trustee or lessor.
Attornment
26. . Not more than ten (10) business days after receipt of written request, Tenant shall furnish to Landlord or any prospective purchaser or lender, a certificate, duly acknowledged, certifying, to the extent true: (a) that this Lease is in full force and effect; (b) that Tenant knows of no default hereunder on the part of Landlord, or if it has reason to believe that such a default exists, the nature thereof in reasonable detail; (c) the amount of the rent being paid and the last date to which rent or any other charges have been paid; (d) that this Lease has not been modified, or if it has been modified, the terms and dates of such modifications; (e) that the term of this Lease has been commenced; (f) that Tenant has accepted and occupied the Leased Premises; (g) the commencement and expiration dates; (h) whether any and all work to be performed by Landlord has been completed; (i) whether any renewal term option has been exercised if applicable; (j) whether there exist any offsets, claims or deductions from, or defenses to, the payment of rent; (k) that Tenant is not aware of any prior assignments of this Lease by Landlord; (l) such other matters as may be reasonably requested by Landlord, or such prospective purchaser or lender.

Access
29. Landlord shall have the right to grant any easement on, over, under and above the Area for such purposes as Landlord determines, provided that such easements do not materially interfere with Tenant's occupancy and use of the Leased Premises.
Easements.
30. . Tenant shall indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, expenses, costs, judgments, and/or demands, including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees, suffered or incurred by Landlord, to the extent arising from third party claims made against Landlord based on activities of Tenant on the Leased Premises, the Building or the Area, and/or on account of any operation or action by Tenant and/or from and against all third party claims made against Landlord to the extent arising from any breach or default on the part of Tenant or any act of negligence of Tenant, its customers, agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees, or invitees; or any accident, injury or death of any person or damage to any property in or about the Leased Premises, the Building or the Area. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on Landlord: (a) promptly notifying Tenant in writing of such claim; (b) giving Tenant control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations subject to Landlord's input and reasonable approval; and (c) cooperating and, at Tenant's request and expense, assisting in such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant will have no obligation under this Section or otherwise with respect to any claim based upon any breach or default on the part of Landlord or any act of negligence of Landlord, its agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees, or invitees (but excluding such acts of any other tenant or such tenant's customers, agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees or invitees).
Indemnification and Waiver
Landlord shall indemnify and hold Tenant harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, expenses, costs, judgments, and/or demands, including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees, suffered or incurred by Tenant, arising from any breach or default on the part of Landlord or any act of negligence of Landlord, its agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees, or invitees (but excluding such acts of any other tenant or such tenant's customers, agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees or invitees).
 
31. . Landlord, or its employees or agents, or any of them, shall not be responsible or liable to Tenant or to Tenant's guests, invitees, employees, agents or any other person or entity, for any loss or damage that may be caused by the acts or omissions of other tenants, their guests or invitees, occupying any other part of the Area or by persons who are trespassers on or in the Area, or for any loss or damage caused or resulting from the bursting, stoppage, backing up or leaking of water, gas, electricity or sewers or caused in any other manner whatsoever, unless such loss or damage is caused by or results from the negligent acts of Landlord, its agents or contractors.
Acts or Omission of Others
32. . Notwithstanding paragraph 51 hereof, whenever a period of time is herein prescribed for the taking of any action by either party, such party shall not be liable or responsible for, and there shall be excluded from the computation of such period of time, any delays due to strikes, riots, acts of God, shortages of labor or materials, war or terrorist acts, governmental laws, regulations or restrictions, or any other cause whatsoever beyond the control of such party, and such nonperformance or delay in performance by such party shall not constitute a breach or default by such party under this Lease nor give rise to any claim against such party for damages or constitute a total or partial eviction, constructive or otherwise.
Inability to Perform
33. .
Hazardous Materials and Environmental Considerations
a. Landlord warrants to Tenant that as of the beginning of the Lease Term, the Leased Premises and the Building each do not contain any Hazardous Material (as defined below).

Any Hazardous Materials located on the Leased Premises shall be handled in an appropriately controlled environment which shall include the use of such equipment as is necessary to meet or exceed standards imposed by any Hazardous Materials Laws and in such a way as not to interfere with any other tenant's use of its premises. Upon breach of any covenant contained herein, Tenant shall, at Tenant's sole expense, cure such breach by taking all action prescribed by any applicable Hazardous Materials Laws or by any governmental authority with jurisdiction over such matters.
c. Tenant shall inform Landlord at any time of (I) any Hazardous Materials it intends to use, generate, handle, store or dispose of, on or about or transport from, the Leased Premises and (ii) of Tenant's discovery of any event or condition which constitutes a violation of any applicable Hazardous Materials Laws. Tenant shall provide to Landlord copies of all communications to or from any governmental authority or any other party relating to Hazardous Materials affecting the Leased Premises.

The indemnification contained herein shall also accrue to the benefit of the employees, agents, officers, directors and/or partners of Tenant.
f. During the Lease Term, Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, take all steps necessary to eliminate and/or otherwise completely remedy any release of Hazardous Materials during the Lease Term in, on or about the Leased Premises or the Building and any resultant damage to property, persons and/or the environment to the extent caused by Tenant.
g. Upon termination of this Lease and/or vacation of the Leased Premises, Tenant shall tender the Leased Premises to Landlord in clean condition, free from the presence of any Hazardous Materials arising from the actions of Tenant, or those acting on its behalf. Tenant shall properly remove all Hazardous Materials and shall then provide to Landlord an environmental audit report, prepared by a professional consultant satisfactory to Landlord and at Tenant's sole expense, certifying that the Leased Premises have not been subjected to environmental harm caused by Tenant's use and occupancy of the Leased Premises. Landlord shall grant to Tenant and its agents or contractors such access to the Leased Premises as is necessary to accomplish such removal and prepare such report.

i. Tenant further covenants and agrees that it shall not install any storage tank (whether above or below the ground) on the Leased Premises without obtaining the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent may be conditioned upon further requirements imposed by Landlord with respect to, among other things, compliance by Tenant with any applicable laws, rules, regulations or ordinances and safety measures or financial responsibility requirements.
j. Should any local governmental entity having jurisdiction over the Leased Premises require any type of environmental audit or report prior to or during the occupancy of the Leased Premises by Tenant, such cost of the audit or report shall be the sole responsibility of Tenant. Landlord shall have the right to conduct, by itself or by its duly authorized agents, employees and contractor, at Landlord's sole cost and expense, periodic environmental audits and inspections of the Leased Premises, the scope and timing of which shall be in the sole discretion of Landlord, but which shall not unreasonably impede Tenant's business operation. In the event Tenant has caused the discharge, emission or disposal of any Hazardous Materials into or from the Leased Premises, the cost of the environmental audit and any and all subsequent clean-up costs shall be at the sole cost and expense of Tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the reason for any audit or report clean-up is due to the condition of the Leased Premises that existed prior to the Lease Term, then all costs and liabilities shall be the responsibility of Landlord, not Tenant.
k. All obligations of the parties hereunder shall survive and continue after the expiration of this Lease or its earlier termination for any reason.
34. .
Default by Tenant- Remedies of Landlord
a. The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute a default by Tenant under this Lease:
i. Failure to make due and punctual payment of rent or any other charges, assessments or amounts within five (5) days or when due or payable or required to be paid under this Lease; or
ii. Material breach of any non-monetary term, covenant or condition of this Lease and failure to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of written notice, if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within the thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall not be in default if Tenant promptly commences to cure the default within the thirty (30) day period and diligently and in good faith continues to cure the default until completion, thereof by Landlord; or
iii. Adjudication of Tenant as bankrupt or insolvent, or filing by or against Tenant of any petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for the adoption of any arrangement under the Bankruptcy Code that is not resolved within sixty (60) days; application is made for the appointment of receiver or conservator for Tenant's business or property; or assignment by Tenant is made of its property for the benefit of its creditors; or Tenant's interest in this Lease or any substantial amount of Tenant's other real or personal property is levied or executed upon by process of law; or
iv. Petition or other proceeding is made by or against Tenant for its dissolution or liquidation; or voluntary dissolution or liquidation of Tenant; or
v. Failure by Tenant to timely take possession of the Leased Premises; or
vi. The occurrence of any event or condition having a material and adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations of Tenant as they exist on the date of this Lease, or the ability of Tenant to meet its obligations under this Lease on a timely basis as provided herein; or
vii. Any representation or warranty by Tenant in this Lease or in any certificate, statement or other document furnished pursuant to or under this Lease, including, without limitation, financial statements, proves to be or becomes incorrect in any material respect.
b. If Tenant shall default in the payment of rent or in the keeping of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease to be kept and/or performed by Tenant or shall otherwise commit any event of default as defined above, Landlord may upon the expiration of any applicable cure, immediately, or at any time thereafter, reenter the Leased Premises, remove all persons and property therefrom, without being liable to indictment, prosecution for damage therefore, or for forcible entry and detainer and repossess and enjoy the Leased Premises, together with all additions thereto or alterations and improvements thereof. Landlord may, at its option, at any time and from time to time thereafter, relet the Leased Premises or any part thereof for the account of Tenant or otherwise, and receive and collect the rents therefore and apply the same first to the payment of such expenses as Landlord may have incurred in recovering possession and for putting the same in good order and condition for re-rental, and expense, commissions and charges paid by Landlord in reletting the Leased Premises. Any such reletting may be for the remainder of the term of this Lease or for a longer or shorter period. In lieu of reletting such Leased Premises, Landlord may occupy the same or cause the same to be occupied by others. Unless Premises are relet, Tenant shall pay Landlord the rent and all other charges required to be paid by Tenant up to the time of the expiration of this Lease or such recovered possession, as the case may be and thereafter, Tenant, if required by Landlord, shall pay to Landlord until the end of the term of this Lease, the equivalent of the amount of all rent reserved herein and all other charges required to be paid by Tenant, less the net amount received by Landlord for such reletting, if any, unless waived by written notice from Landlord to Tenant. No action by Landlord to obtain possession of the Leased Premises and/or to recover any amount due to Landlord hereunder shall be taken as a
 
waiver of Landlord's right to require full and complete performance by Tenant of all terms hereof, including payment of all amounts due hereunder or as an election on the part of Landlord to terminate this Lease Agreement. If the Leased Premises are reoccupied by Landlord pursuant hereto, and regardless of whether the Leased Premises shall be relet or possessed by Landlord, all fixtures, additions, furniture, and the like then on the Leased Premises may be retained by Landlord. In the event Tenant is in default under the terms hereof beyond any applicable cure period and, by the sole determination of Landlord, has abandoned the Leased Premises, Landlord shall have the right to remove all Tenant's property from the Leased Premises and dispose of said property in such a manner as determined best by Landlord, at the sole cost and expense of Tenant and without liability of Landlord for the actions so taken.
c. In the event an assignment of Tenant's business or property shall be made for the benefit of creditors, or, if Tenant's leasehold interest under the terms of this Lease Agreement shall be levied upon by execution or seized by virtue of any writ of any court of law, or, if application be made for the appointment of a receiver for the business or property of Tenant, or, if a petition in bankruptcy shall be filed by or against Tenant, then and in any such case, at Landlord's option, with or without notice, Landlord may terminate this Lease and immediately retake possession of the Leased Premises without the same working any forfeiture of the obligations of Tenant hereunder.
d. In addition to all rights and remedies granted to Landlord by the terms hereof, Landlord shall have available any and all rights and remedies available at law or in equity, or under the statutes of the State of Colorado. No remedy herein or otherwise conferred upon or reserved to Landlord shall be considered exclusive of any other remedy but shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Further, all powers and remedies given by this Lease to Landlord may be exercised, from time to time, and as often as occasion may arise or as Landlord may deem expedient. No delay or omission of Landlord to exercise any right or power arising from any default shall impair any such right or power or shall be considered to be a waiver of any such default or acquiescence thereof. The acceptance of rent by Landlord shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any breach of any of the covenants herein contained or of any of the rights of Landlord to any remedies herein given.
e. To the extent allowed by law, Tenant waives any obligation of Landlord to mitigate its damages, whether statutory or at common law. In the event Landlord undertakes to mitigate its damages, Landlord will satisfy any duty to mitigate as long as Landlord's marketing activities related to the Leased Premises are substantially comparable to the marketing efforts Landlord has historically taken for similarly sized, situated and configured space in the Building. Landlord is not required to specially market the Leased Premises, send out any special fliers to the real estate brokerage community, take out any advertisements in magazines, newspapers or other periodicals, or to provide any leasing incentives, whether to potential tenants or their real estate broker. Landlord specifically has the right to lease other available space in the Building, preferentially to the Leased Premises and Tenant waives any obligation to do so.
35.
Default by Landlord- Remedies of Tenant
a. Neglect or failure by Landlord to perform or observe, or any other breach of, any covenant or condition of this Lease on the part of Landlord to be performed or observed within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof . If such breach cannot reasonably be cured within the thirty (30) day period, Landlord shall not be in default if Landlord promptly commences to cure the default within the thirty (30) day period and diligently and in good faith continues to cure the default until completion but in no event shall such completion take longer than one hundred twenty (120) days, provided however if not cured within first thirty (30) days.
b. In addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall have available any and all rights and remedies available at law or in equity, or under the statutes of the State of Colorado. No remedy herein or otherwise conferred upon or reserved to Tenant shall be considered exclusive of any other remedy but shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Further, all powers and remedies given by this Lease to Tenant may be exercised, from time to time, and as often as occasion may arise or as may be deemed expedient. No delay or omission of Tenant to exercise any right or power arising from any default shall impair any such right or power or shall be considered to be a waiver of any such default or acquiescence thereof. The acceptance of any monetary payment by Tenant shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any breach of any of the covenants herein contained or of any of the rights of Tenant to any remedies herein given.
36. . Any amount due to Landlord not paid when due shall bear interest at one and a half (1.5%) percent per month from due date until paid. Payment of such interest shall not excuse or cure any default by Tenant under this Lease.
Interest on Past Due Obligations
37. . In the event any check, bank draft or negotiable instrument given for any money payment hereunder shall be dishonored at any time and from time to time, for any reason whatsoever not attributable to Landlord, Landlord shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy that may be available, (1) to make an administrative charge of $100.00 or three times the face value of the check, bank draft or negotiable instrument, whichever is smaller, and (2) at Landlord's sole option, to require Tenant to make all future rental payments in cashier's check.
Administrative Charges
38. . If a default by a party occurs, then the defaulting party shall reimburse the other party on demand for all costs reasonably incurred by such party in connection therewith including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and related costs, plus interest thereon from the date such costs are paid by Landlord until Tenant reimburses Landlord, at the rate specified in paragraph 36 hereof. In the event of proceeding at law or in equity by either party hereto, the defaulting party shall pay all costs and expenses, including all reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the non-defaulting party in pursuing such remedy, if such non-defaulting party is awarded substantially the relief requested.
Legal Proceedings  Responsibilities
 
39. . If Tenant shall remain in possession of the Leased Premises after the termination of this Lease, whether by expiration of the Lease Term or otherwise, without a written agreement as to such possession, then Tenant shall be deemed a month-to-month Tenant. The rent rate during such holdover tenancy shall be equivalent to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the monthly rent paid for the last full month of tenancy under this Lease, excluding any free rent concessions which may have been made for the last full month of the Lease. No holding over by Tenant shall operate to renew or extend this Lease without the written consent of Landlord to such renewal or extension having been first obtained. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against loss or liability resulting from the delay by Tenant in surrendering possession of the Leased Premises including, without limitation, any claims made with regard to any succeeding occupancy bounded by such holdover period.
Holding Over
40. . On the last day of the term of this Lease, or on any sooner termination, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly quit and surrender the Leased Premises to Landlord in the same condition as received at the commencement of the Lease Term, broom clean, with Tenant's personal property removed, which removal, if attached to the wall or floors will not require Tenant to reconstruct or repair any holes left in such walls or floors caused by such removal, clean and free of debris, excepting only ordinary wear and tear and loss by fire or other casualty which Tenant is not obligated to repair pursuant to this Lease. Any damage or deterioration of the Leased Premises shall not be deemed ordinary wear and tear if the same could have been prevented by good maintenance practices by Tenant. Tenant shall repair any damage to the Leased Premises. Except as otherwise stated in this Lease, Tenant shall leave the power panels, electrical distribution systems, plumbing, lighting fixtures, air conditioning, floors, walls, and ceilings on the Leased Premises in good operating and/or useable condition.
Surrender of the Leased Premises
41. . If, during the term of this Lease, Landlord shall sell or otherwise transfer its interest in the Area, or the Leased Premises, then from and after the effective date of the sale or transfer Landlord shall be released and discharged from any and all obligations and responsibilities under this Lease except those already accrued, and such purchaser or transferee shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of Landlord hereunder accruing after such effective date.
Effect of Conveyance
42. . In no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any failure of other tenants in the Building to operate their businesses, or for any loss or damage that may be occasioned by or through the acts or omissions of other tenants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Lease, neither Landlord, nor any disclosed or undisclosed officers, principals, directors, employees, members, servants or agents of Landlord, their successors, assigns, agents, or any mortgagee in possession shall have any personal liability with respect to any provisions of this Lease and, if Landlord is in breach or default with respect to its obligations or otherwise, Tenant shall look solely to Landlord's interest in the Building and the Area for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies. Whenever in this Lease there is imposed upon Landlord the obligation to act in good faith or to use its best efforts, reasonable efforts, or diligence, Landlord shall be required to do so only to the extent the same is economically feasible and otherwise will not impose upon Landlord extreme financial or other burdens.
Limitation of Landlord Liability
43. . Nothing contained in this Lease shall be deemed, held or construed as creating Landlord as a partner, agent, associate of or in joint venture with Tenant in the conduct of Tenant's business, it being expressly understood and agreed that the relationship between the parties hereto is and shall at all times remain that of Landlord and Tenant.
Landlord Not a Partner with Tenant

See below for Option Term Rent. In the event of such exercise, this Lease Agreement shall be automatically extended for the additional term.

See below for Option Term Rent. In the event of such exercise, this Lease Agreement shall be automatically extended for the additional term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option shall be void and of no force or effect if the Tenant is in default hereunder either as of the date of the Tenant's exercise of said option or as of the date of the commencement of the option or additional term.
 
Landlord and Tenant will attempt to agree upon a Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises satisfactory to both parties within thirty (30) days of Tenant's exercise of its option. If no agreement can be reached by the parties during that period, then the Base Monthly Rental for the Option Term shall be determined by the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises as determined by comparison to premises of similar size located in or near the City of Fort Collins, Colorado, having comparable development, use and density capability and such other characteristics as may be deemed relevant by a subject appraiser whose selection is outlined herein.
Landlord shall select an independent commercial real estate broker with at least ten (10) years' experience in the City of Fort Collins, Colorado (a "Qualified Broker"). The Qualified Broker selected by the Landlord shall be referred to as the "Landlord's Broker". Within thirty (30) days of being selected by the Landlord, the Landlord's Broker shall determine the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises in accordance with the appraisal standards set forth above and shall immediately give the Landlord and the Tenant written notification of his determination.
If the Tenant agrees with the Landlord's Broker's determination of the Fair Market Rental Value, the new Base Monthly Rental shall become effective beginning with the first month of the Option Term. If the Tenant does not agree with the Landlord's Broker's determination of Fair Market Rental Value, the Tenant shall have the right to select its own Qualified Broker to determine the Fair Market Rental Value. If the Tenant does elect to appoint a Qualified Broker (the "Tenant's Broker"), the Tenant shall select the Tenant's Broker within thirty (30) business days after receiving the Landlord's Broker's determination of the Fair Market Rental Value. The Tenant's Broker shall make his own determination of the Fair Market Rental Value in accordance with the provisions set forth above, within thirty (30) business days of being selected by the Tenant and shall immediately give the Landlord and the Tenant written notice of his determination.
If the Fair Market Rental Values as determined by the Landlord's Broker and the Tenant's Broker, respectively, differ by an amount which is equal to or less than 5% of the Fair Market Rental Value determined by the Landlord's Broker, then the arithmetic mean of the two Fair Market Rental Values shall constitute the Fair Market Rental Value used to calculate the new Base Monthly Rental which will be in effect for the Option Term. If the Fair Market Rental Value determined by the Landlord's Broker and the Tenant's Broker, respectively, differ by an amount which is greater than 5%, then, within ten (10) business days after Tenant's Broker's written notification of his determination of the Fair Market Rental Value, the Landlord's Broker and the Tenant's Broker shall agree upon and select a third Qualified Broker who shall be independent of and have no prior or existing affiliation or relationship with either the Landlord or the Tenant (the "Independent Broker"). Within ten (10) business days of being appointed, the Independent Broker shall, after exercising his best professional judgment, choose either the
 
 
Landlord's Broker's or the Tenant's Broker's determination of Fair Market Rental Value which the Independent Broker believes, in his best professional judgement, best represents the Fair Market Rental Value at that point in time. Upon making such a selection, the Independent Broker shall immediately give the Landlord and the Tenant written notice of this selection of the Fair Market Rental Value. The Fair Market Rental Value selected by the Independent Broker shall be used to calculate the new Base Monthly Rental which will be in effect during the Extension Option, and such selection by the Independent Broker shall be binding and conclusive upon the Landlord and the Tenant.

Sign Approval
 
approved by Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. As a condition to the granting of such approval, Landlord shall have the right to require Tenant to furnish a bond or other security acceptable to Landlord sufficient to insure completion of and payment for any such sign work to be so performed. Tenant shall, during the entire Lease Term, maintain Tenant's signs in good condition and repair at Tenant's sole cost and expense. Tenant shall, remove all signs at the termination of this Lease, at Tenant's sole risk and expense and shall in a workmanlike manner properly repair any damage and close any holes caused by the installation and/or removal of Tenant's signs. Tenant shall give Landlord prior notice of such removal so that a representative of Landlord shall have the opportunity of being present when the signage is removed, or shall pre-approve the manner and materials used to repair damage and close the holes caused by removal. Tenant's existing monument and building signs have been approved by the landlord and will remain in place for the term of the lease and any extensions thereof, except in the event of development of Lot 5, in which case Landlord reserves the right, at its own expense, to remove the existing monument sign should that become necessary. If the event such development includes a multi-tenant directory sign listing other business park tenants, then Tenant shall be allowed, at its pro-rata cost, to be included on the sign.
20. . In the event the Leased Premises and/or the Building of which the Leased Premises are a part shall be totally destroyed by fire or other casualty or so badly damaged that, in the opinion of Landlord, it is not feasible to repair or rebuild same, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Tenant and all obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall cease.

If Landlord elects to exercise the right herein vested in it to terminate this Lease as a result of damage to or destruction of the Leased Premises or the Building in which the Leased Premises are located, said election shall be made by giving notice thereof to Tenant within ninety (90) days after the date of said damage or destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall not have any obligation whatsoever to repair, reconstruct or restore the Leased Premises or the Building when the damage resulting from any casualty covered under this Lease occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the term or any renewal term. Any option to renew this Lease that Tenant may be entitled to exercise shall be null and void if such option has not been exercised prior to any such casualty that occurs during the last twelve (12) months of the term or any renewal term and Landlord elects not to repair, reconstruct or restore the Leased Premises or the Building.
Damage or Destruction of Leased Premises
Such restoration by Landlord shall not include replacement of Tenant's trade fixtures, furniture, equipment or other items that do not become part of the Building or any improvements to the Leased Premises in excess of those provided for in the allowance (if any) for building standard items as of the Commencement Date of this Lease. Restoration of the Leased Premises required beyond Landlord's obligation shall be performed by Tenant at no cost to Landlord. Tenant agrees that during any period of reconstruction or repair of the Leased Premises to continue the operation of business in the Leased Premises to the extent reasonably practicable. The Base Rent shall be abated or reduced proportionately to the proportion of the Leased Premises that has been damaged or destroyed during any period in which, by reason of such damage or destruction, there is a substantial interference with the operation of Tenant's business.
21. . The parties agree that Landlord shall have complete freedom of negotiation and settlement of all matters pertaining to the acquisition of the Leased Premises, the Building, the Area, or any part thereof, by any governmental body or other person or entity via the exercise of the power of eminent domain, it being understood and agreed that any financial settlement made or compensation paid respecting said land or improvements to be so taken, whether resulting from negotiation and agreement or legal proceedings, shall be the exclusive property of Landlord, there being no sharing whatsoever between Landlord and Tenant of any sum so paid. In the event of any such taking, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease on the date possession is delivered to the condemning person or authority and all obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall cease. Such taking of the property shall not be a breach of this Lease by Landlord nor give rise to any claims in Tenant for damages or compensation from Landlord. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as depriving Tenant of the right to retain as its sole property any compensation paid for any tangible personal property owned by Tenant which is taken in any such condemnation proceeding.
Governmental Acquisition of Property
If a taking of the Leased Premises, the Building, or any part thereof pursuant to the above provisions occurs as to less than substantially all of the Leased Premises and Tenant can reasonably operate on the remainder of the Leased Premises the business being conducted on the Leased Premises at the time of such taking, this Lease shall not terminate and the monthly rental thereafter due and payable by Tenant shall be reduced in such proportion as the value of the whole of the Leased Premises shall be reduced as a result of such taking. If Landlord and Tenant are unable to agree whether substantially all of the Leased Premises has been taken as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, or the amount by which the monthly rental should be reduced, such question shall be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The decision of such arbitration shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties thereto, and all fees and expenses of such arbitration (exclusive of attorneys' fees) shall be shared by the parties thereto. If a taking of more than 50% of the Leased Premises occurs and Tenant cannot reasonably operate in the remainder of the Leased Premises the business being conducted on the Leased Premises at the time of such taking, Tenant shall have the option to terminate this lease with thirty (30) days notice. Such taking of the property shall not be a breach of this Lease by Landlord nor give rise to any claims in Tenant for damages or compensation from Landlord.
 
22. . Tenant may not assign this Lease (whether voluntary or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise), or sublet the Leased Premises or any part thereof, without the written consent of Landlord, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. No such assignment or subletting if approved by Landlord shall relieve Tenant of any of its obligations hereunder, and, the performance or nonperformance of any of the covenants herein contained by subtenants shall be considered as the performance or the nonperformance by Tenant. A merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all (50% or more) of the assets of Tenant or a transfer of a substantial ownership interest (50% or more) in Tenant, except for transfers by will or otherwise upon death, shall constitute an assignment of this Lease for the purpose of this paragraph. Any consent to assignment or subletting given by Landlord shall not constitute a waiver of necessity for such consent to a subsequent assignment or subletting. Notwithstanding any assignment or sublease, Tenant and all Guarantors shall remain fully liable under the terms and conditions of this Lease and shall not be released from performing any of the terms, covenants and conditions hereof. Any assignee or subtenant (in addition to Tenant) shall be personally responsible for all payments, conditions, covenants and agreements contained in or provided by this Lease. Any assignment or subletting in violation of this paragraph 21 shall be null and void, and at Landlord's option, shall constitute a default under this Lease.
Assignment or Subletting
Tenant hereby assigns and transfers to Landlord all of Tenant's interest in all rentals and income arising from any sublease made by Tenant, and Landlord may collect such rent and income and apply same toward Tenant's obligations under this Lease. Landlord shall not, by reason of this or any other assignment of such sublease to Landlord nor by reason of the collection of the rents from a subtenant, be deemed liable to the subtenant for any failure of Tenant to perform and comply with any of Tenant's obligations to such subtenant under such sublease. Tenant hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs any such subtenant, upon receipt of a written notice from Landlord stating that a default exists in the performance of Tenant's obligations under this Lease, to pay to Landlord the rents due and to become due under the sublease. Tenant agrees that such subtenant shall have the right to rely upon any such statement and request from Landlord, and that such subtenant shall pay such rents to Landlord without any obligation or right to inquire as to whether such default exists and notwithstanding any notice from or claim from Tenant to the contrary. Tenant shall have no right or claim against said subtenant or Landlord for any such rents so paid by said subtenant to Landlord.
No sublease entered into by Tenant shall be effective unless and until it has been approved in writing by Landlord. In entering into any sublease, Tenant shall use only such form of sublease as is reasonably satisfactory to Landlord, and once approved by Landlord, such sublease shall not be changed or modified without Landlord's prior written consent. Any subtenant shall, by reason of entering into a sublease under this Lease, be deemed, for the benefit of Landlord, to have assumed and agreed to conform and comply with each and every obligation herein to be performed by Tenant other than such obligations as are contrary to or inconsistent with provisions contained in a sublease to which Landlord has expressly consented in writing. No subtenant shall further assign or sublet all or any part of the Leased Premises without Landlord's prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
In any situation in which Landlord consents to an assignment or sublease hereunder, Tenant shall promptly deliver to Landlord a fully executed copy of the final sublease agreement or assignment instrument and all ancillary agreements relating thereto. No assignment shall be effective unless the assignee has agreed within the assignment instrument to assume the obligations of Tenant hereunder and to be personally bound by all of the covenants, terms and conditions hereof on the part of Tenant to be performed or observed hereunder.
If Tenant shall assign or sublet the Premises or request the consent of Landlord to any assignment or subletting or if Tenant shall request the consent of Landlord for any act Tenant proposes to do then Tenant shall pay Landlord's reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including attorneys, architects', engineers' or other consultants' fees. In addition, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as additional rent, all reasonable additional direct and indirect expenses incurred by Landlord due to any such assignee or sublessee taking possession of the Premises, including, but not limited to, freight elevator operation, security service, janitorial service and rubbish removal.
Landlord reserves the right to condition any approval to assign or sublet upon Landlord's determination that (i) the proposed assignee or subtenant shall conduct a business on the Premises of a quality substantially equal to that of Tenant and consistent with the general character of the other occupants of the Building, and (ii) the proposed assignee or subtenant be financially responsible Tenant shall have an unrestricted right, at any time during the lease term or any extension period, without Landlord's approval, to assign the lease or to sublease all or any portion of the Premises to any successor organization (defined as a parent, subsidiary or affiliated entity resulting from a merger, acquisition or reorganization of Tenant).
23. . Tenant's request of Landlord's consent to an assignment of this Lease or a subletting of all or any part of the Leased Premises shall contain a written offer to Landlord to recapture the Leased Premises (or the portion thereof proposed to be sublet, in the case of a subletting), at the lesser of (i) the then current rental in effect under this Lease; or (ii) the rental Tenant proposes to obtain as a result of the assignment or sublease. Upon receipt of such written offer, Landlord shall have the option, to be exercised within ten (10) days following receipt of such offer, to accept the offer to recapture in accordance with this paragraph. If such offer is accepted by Landlord, Tenant shall execute an assignment of the Lease or a sublease to Landlord in a form acceptable to Landlord, with Landlord having the right to sublease the portion of the Leased Premises affected to others without any requirement of obtaining Tenant's consent therefore. Except as hereafter provided, Tenant shall not be relieved of its liability under this Lease. If Landlord exercises its option to recapture and the assignment or sublease from Tenant provides for a rental rate equal to the rental rate in effect as of the date the option is exercised, Tenant shall be released of all further liability under this Lease as of the effective date of the assignment or sublease with respect to that portion of the Leased Premises subject to the assignment or sublease. If Landlord does not exercise its option within the time herein specified and consents in writing to Tenant's
Recapture of Leased Premises
 
request to assign or sublease, Tenant shall, in a form acceptable to Landlord, assign or sublease to the assignee or subtenant named in Tenant's request within thirty (30) days from the date of Tenant's request at a rental rate equal to the rental rate specified in the request. In the event Tenant fails to execute and deliver any assignment or sublease within thirty (30) days from the date of Tenant's request, then Tenant shall again comply with all the provision and conditions of this paragraph before assigning this Lease or subletting all or any portion of the Leased Premises.
24. Tenant agrees that this Lease shall be subordinate to any mortgages, trust deeds or ground leases that may now exist or which may hereafter be placed upon said Leased Premises and to any and all advances to be made thereunder, and to the interest thereon, and all renewals, replacements and extensions thereof. This provision is intended to be self-effectuating and no separate instrument or subordination is required to rely on this subordination. However, Tenant shall execute and deliver whatever instruments may be required for the above purposes, which instruments shall include Non-Disturbance provisions. Tenant shall in the event of the sale or assignment of Landlord's interest in the Area or in the Building of which the Leased Premises form a part, or in the event of any proceedings brought for the foreclosure of or in the event of exercise of the power of sale under any mortgage made by Landlord covering the Leased Premises, attorn to the purchaser and recognize such purchaser as Landlord under this Lease.

In the event of such enforcement and upon Tenant's attornment as aforesaid, Tenant will automatically become the tenant of the successor to Landlord's interest without change in the terms or provisions of this Lease; provided, however, that such successor to Landlord's interest shall not be bound by (a) any payment of Base Rent for more than one (1) month in advance, or (b) any amendments or modifications of this Lease made without the prior written consent of such mortgagee, trustee or lessor.
Attornment

Easements.
30. . Tenant shall indemnify and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, expenses, costs, judgments, and/or demands, including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees, suffered or incurred by Landlord, to the extent arising from third party claims made against Landlord based on activities of Tenant on the Leased Premises, the Building or the Area, and/or on account of any operation or action by Tenant and/or from and against all third party claims made against Landlord to the extent arising from any breach or default on the part of Tenant or any act of negligence of Tenant, its customers, agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees, or invitees; or any accident, injury or death of any person or damage to any property in or about the Leased Premises, the Building or the Area.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant will have no obligation under this Section or otherwise with respect to any claim based upon any breach or default on the part of Landlord or any act of negligence of Landlord, its agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees, or invitees (but excluding such acts of any other tenant or such tenant's customers, agents, contractors, servants, employees, licensees or invitees).

34. .
Default by Tenant- Remedies of Landlord
a. The occurrence of any of the following events shall constitute a default by Tenant under this Lease:
i. Failure to make due and punctual payment of rent or any other charges, assessments or amounts within five (5) days or when due or payable or required to be paid under this Lease; or
ii. Material breach of any non-monetary term, covenant or condition of this Lease and failure to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of written notice, if such breach cannot reasonably be cured within the thirty (30) day period, Tenant shall not be in default if Tenant promptly commences to cure the default within the thirty (30) day period and diligently and in good faith continues to cure the default until completion, thereof by Landlord; or
iii. Adjudication of Tenant as bankrupt or insolvent, or filing by or against Tenant of any petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for the adoption of any arrangement under the Bankruptcy Code that is not resolved within sixty (60) days; application is made for the appointment of receiver or conservator for Tenant's business or property; or assignment by Tenant is made of its property for the benefit of its creditors; or Tenant's interest in this Lease or any substantial amount of Tenant's other real or personal property is levied or executed upon by process of law; or
iv. Petition or other proceeding is made by or against Tenant for its dissolution or liquidation; or voluntary dissolution or liquidation of Tenant; or
v. Failure by Tenant to timely take possession of the Leased Premises; or
vi. The occurrence of any event or condition having a material and adverse effect on the assets, liabilities, financial condition, business or operations of Tenant as they exist on the date of this Lease, or the ability of Tenant to meet its obligations under this Lease on a timely basis as provided herein; or
vii. Any representation or warranty by Tenant in this Lease or in any certificate, statement or other document furnished pursuant to or under this Lease, including, without limitation, financial statements, proves to be or becomes incorrect in any material respect.
b. If Tenant shall default in the payment of rent or in the keeping of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease to be kept and/or performed by Tenant or shall otherwise commit any event of default as defined above, Landlord may upon the expiration of any applicable cure, immediately, or at any time thereafter, reenter the Leased Premises, remove all persons and property therefrom, without being liable to indictment, prosecution for damage therefore, or for forcible entry and detainer and repossess and enjoy the Leased Premises, together with all additions thereto or alterations and improvements thereof. Landlord may, at its option, at any time and from time to time thereafter, relet the Leased Premises or any part thereof for the account of Tenant or otherwise, and receive and collect the rents therefore and apply the same first to the payment of such expenses as Landlord may have incurred in recovering possession and for putting the same in good order and condition for re-rental, and expense, commissions and charges paid by Landlord in reletting the Leased Premises. Any such reletting may be for the remainder of the term of this Lease or for a longer or shorter period.

reserved herein and all other charges required to be paid by Tenant, less the net amount received by Landlord for such reletting, if any, unless waived by written notice from Landlord to Tenant. No action by Landlord to obtain possession of the Leased Premises and/or to recover any amount due to Landlord hereunder shall be taken as a waiver of Landlord's right to require full and complete performance by Tenant of all terms hereof, including payment of all amounts due hereunder or as an election on the part of Landlord to terminate this Lease Agreement. If the Leased Premises are reoccupied by Landlord pursuant hereto, and regardless of whether the Leased Premises shall be relet or possessed by Landlord, all fixtures, additions, furniture, and the like then on the Leased Premises may be retained by Landlord. In the event Tenant is in default under the terms hereof beyond any applicable cure period and, by the sole determination of Landlord, has abandoned the Leased Premises, Landlord shall have the right to remove all Tenant's property from the Leased Premises and dispose of said property in such a manner as determined best by Landlord, at the sole cost and expense of Tenant and without liability of Landlord for the actions so taken.

d. In addition to all rights and remedies granted to Landlord by the terms hereof, Landlord shall have available any and all rights and remedies available at law or in equity, or under the statutes of the State of Colorado. No remedy herein or otherwise conferred upon or reserved to Landlord shall be considered exclusive of any other remedy but shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Further, all powers and remedies given by this Lease to Landlord may be exercised, from time to time, and as often as occasion may arise or as Landlord may deem expedient. No delay or omission of Landlord to exercise any right or power arising from any default shall impair any such right or power or shall be considered to be a waiver of any such default or acquiescence thereof. The acceptance of rent by Landlord shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any breach of any of the covenants herein contained or of any of the rights of Landlord to any remedies herein given.
e. To the extent allowed by law, Tenant waives any obligation of Landlord to mitigate its damages, whether statutory or at common law. In the event Landlord undertakes to mitigate its damages, Landlord will satisfy any duty to mitigate as long as Landlord's marketing activities related to the Leased Premises are substantially comparable to the marketing efforts Landlord has historically taken for similarly sized, situated and configured space in the Building. Landlord is not required to specially market the Leased Premises, send out any special fliers to the real estate brokerage community, take out any advertisements in magazines, newspapers or other periodicals, or to provide any leasing incentives, whether to potential tenants or their real estate broker. Landlord specifically has the right to lease other available space in the Building, preferentially to the Leased Premises and Tenant waives any obligation to do so.
35.
Default by Landlord- Remedies of Tenant
a. Neglect or failure by Landlord to perform or observe, or any other breach of, any covenant or condition of this Lease on the part of Landlord to be performed or observed within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice thereof . If such breach cannot reasonably be cured within the thirty (30) day period, Landlord shall not be in default if Landlord promptly commences to cure the default within the thirty (30) day period and diligently and in good faith continues to cure the default until completion but in no event shall such completion take longer than one hundred twenty days, provided however if not cured within first thirty (30) days.
b. In addition to the foregoing, Tenant shall have available any and all rights and remedies available at law or in equity, or under the statutes of the State of Colorado. No remedy herein or otherwise conferred upon or reserved to Tenant shall be considered exclusive of any other remedy but shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Further, all powers and remedies given by this Lease to Tenant may be exercised, from time to time, and as often as occasion may arise or as may be deemed expedient. No delay or omission of Tenant to exercise any right or power arising from any default shall impair any such right or power or shall be considered to be a waiver of any such default or acquiescence thereof. The acceptance of any monetary payment by Tenant shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any breach of any of the covenants herein contained or of any of the rights of Tenant to any remedies herein given.
36. . Any amount due to Landlord not paid when due shall bear interest at one and a half (1.5%) percent per month from due date until paid. Payment of such interest shall not excuse or cure any default by Tenant under this Lease.
Interest on Past Due Obligations
37. . In the event any check, bank draft or negotiable instrument given for any money payment hereunder shall be dishonored at any time and from time to time, for any reason whatsoever not attributable to Landlord, Landlord shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedy that may be available, (1) to make an administrative charge of $100.00 or three times the face value of the check, bank draft or negotiable instrument, whichever is smaller, and (2) at Landlord's sole option, to require Tenant to make all future rental payments in cashier's check.
Administrative Charges
38. . If a default by a party occurs, then the defaulting party shall reimburse the other party on demand for all costs reasonably incurred by such party in connection therewith including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and related costs, plus interest thereon from the date such costs are paid by
Legal Proceedings  Responsibilities
 
Landlord until Tenant reimburses Landlord, at the rate specified in paragraph 36 hereof. In the event of proceeding at law or in equity by either party hereto, the defaulting party shall pay all costs and expenses, including all reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the non-defaulting party in pursuing such remedy, if such non-defaulting party is awarded substantially the relief requested.
39. . If Tenant shall remain in possession of the Leased Premises after the termination of this Lease, whether by expiration of the Lease Term or otherwise, without a written agreement as to such possession, then Tenant shall be deemed a month-to-month Tenant. The rent rate during such holdover tenancy shall be equivalent to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the monthly rent paid for the last full month of tenancy under this Lease, excluding any free rent concessions which may have been made for the last full month of the Lease. No holding over by Tenant shall operate to renew or extend this Lease without the written consent of Landlord to such renewal or extension having been first obtained. Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against loss or liability resulting from the delay by Tenant in surrendering possession of the Leased Premises including, without limitation, any claims made with regard to any succeeding occupancy bounded by such holdover period.
Holding Over
40. . On the last day of the term of this Lease, or on any sooner termination, Tenant shall peaceably and quietly quit and surrender the Leased Premises to Landlord in the same condition as received at the commencement of the Lease Term, broom clean, with Tenant's personal property removed, which removal, if attached to the wall or floors will not require Tenant to reconstruct or repair any holes left in such walls or floors caused by such removal, clean and free of debris, excepting only ordinary wear and tear and loss by fire or other casualty which Tenant is not obligated to repair pursuant to this Lease. Any damage or deterioration of the Leased Premises shall not be deemed ordinary wear and tear if the same could have been prevented by good maintenance practices by Tenant. Tenant shall repair any damage to the Leased Premises. Except as otherwise stated in this Lease, Tenant shall leave the power panels, electrical distribution systems, plumbing, lighting fixtures, air conditioning, floors, walls, and ceilings on the Leased Premises in good operating and/or useable condition.
Surrender of the Leased Premises
41. . If, during the term of this Lease, Landlord shall sell or otherwise transfer its interest in the Area, or the Leased Premises, then from and after the effective date of the sale or transfer Landlord shall be released and discharged from any and all obligations and responsibilities under this Lease except those already accrued, and such purchaser or transferee shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of Landlord hereunder accruing after such effective date.
Effect of Conveyance
42. . In no event shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for any failure of other tenants in the Building to operate their businesses, or for any loss or damage that may be occasioned by or through the acts or omissions of other tenants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Lease, neither Landlord, nor any disclosed or undisclosed officers, principals, directors, employees, members, servants or agents of Landlord, their successors, assigns, agents, or any mortgagee in possession shall have any personal liability with respect to any provisions of this Lease and, if Landlord is in breach or default with respect to its obligations or otherwise, Tenant shall look solely to Landlord's interest in the Building and the Area for the satisfaction of Tenant's remedies. Whenever in this Lease there is imposed upon Landlord the obligation to act in good faith or to use its best efforts, reasonable efforts, or diligence, Landlord shall be required to do so only to the extent the same is economically feasible and otherwise will not impose upon Landlord extreme financial or other burdens.
Limitation of Landlord Liability
43. . Nothing contained in this Lease shall be deemed, held or construed as creating Landlord as a partner, agent, associate of or in joint venture with Tenant in the conduct of Tenant's business, it being expressly understood and agreed that the relationship between the parties hereto is and shall at all times remain that of Landlord and Tenant.
Landlord Not a Partner With Tenant
44. . The Lease, and all terms hereunder shall be construed consistent with the laws of the State of Colorado. Any dispute resulting in litigation hereunder shall be resolved in court proceedings instituted in Larimer County and in no other jurisdiction.

See below for Option Term Rent. In the event of such exercise, this Lease Agreement shall be automatically extended for the additional term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option shall be void and of no force or effect if the Tenant is in default hereunder either as of the date of the Tenant's exercise of said option or as of the date of the commencement of the option or additional term.
 
See below for Option Term Rent. In the event of such exercise, this Lease Agreement shall be automatically extended for the additional term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this option shall be void and of no force or effect if the Tenant is in default hereunder either as of the date of the Tenant's exercise of said option or as of the date of the commencement of the option or additional term.
 
Landlord and Tenant will attempt to agree upon a Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises satisfactory to both parties within thirty (30) days of Tenant's exercise of its option. If no agreement can be reached by the parties during that period, then the Base Monthly Rental for the Option Term shall be determined by the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises as determined by comparison to premises of similar size located in or near the City of Fort Collins, Colorado, having comparable development, use and density capability and such other characteristics as may be deemed relevant by a subject appraiser whose selection is outlined herein.
Landlord shall select an independent commercial real estate broker with at least ten (10) years' experience in the City of Fort Collins, Colorado (a "Qualified Broker"). The Qualified Broker selected by the Landlord shall be referred to as the "Landlord's Broker". Within thirty (30) days of being selected by the Landlord, the Landlord's Broker shall determine the Fair Market Rental Value of the Leased Premises in accordance with the appraisal standards set forth above and shall immediately give the Landlord and the Tenant written notification of his determination.
If the Tenant agrees with the Landlord's Broker's determination of the Fair Market Rental Value, the new Base Monthly Rental shall become effective beginning with the first month of the Option Term. If the Tenant does not agree with the Landlord's Broker's determination of Fair Market Rental Value, the Tenant shall have the right to select its own Qualified Broker to determine the Fair Market Rental Value. If the Tenant does elect to appoint a Qualified Broker (the "Tenant's Broker"), the Tenant shall select the Tenant's Broker within thirty (30) business days after receiving the Landlord's Broker's determination of the Fair Market Rental Value. The Tenant's Broker shall make his own determination of the Fair Market Rental Value in accordance with the provisions set forth above, within thirty (30) business days of being selected by the Tenant and shall immediately give the Landlord and the Tenant written notice of his determination.
If the Fair Market Rental Values as determined by the Landlord's Broker and the Tenant's Broker, respectively, differ by an amount which is equal to or less than 5% of the Fair Market Rental Value determined by the Landlord's Broker, then the arithmetic mean of the two Fair Market Rental Values shall constitute the Fair Market Rental Value used to calculate the new Base Monthly Rental which will be in effect for the Option Term. If the Fair Market Rental Value determined by the Landlord's Broker and the Tenant's Broker, respectively, differ by an amount which is greater than 5%, then, within ten (10) business days after Tenant's Broker's written notification of his determination of the Fair Market Rental Value, the Landlord's Broker and the Tenant's Broker shall agree upon and select a third Qualified Broker who shall be independent of and have no prior or existing affiliation or relationship with either the Landlord or the Tenant (the "Independent Broker"). Within ten (10) business days of being appointed, the Independent Broker shall, after exercising his best professional
 
 
judgment, choose either the Landlord's Broker's or the Tenant's Broker's determination of Fair Market Rental Value which the Independent Broker believes, in his best professional judgement, best represents the Fair Market Rental Value at that point in time. Upon making such a selection, the Independent Broker shall immediately give the Landlord and the Tenant written notice of this selection of the Fair Market Rental Value. The Fair Market Rental Value selected by the Independent Broker shall be used to calculate the new Base Monthly Rental which will be in effect during the Extension Option, and such selection by the Independent Broker shall be binding and conclusive upon the Landlord and the Tenant.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
As previously disclosed in Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.'s (the "Company's") current report on Form 8-K filed on December 6, 2011 (the "Prior Disclosure"), the Company redesigned its executive compensation structure to reinforce a "Pay for Performance Culture" and, as part of the new structure, adopted its 2012-2014 Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTI Plan"). The LTI Plan, which covers three one-year performance periods, is an integral part of the Company's 2012-2014 strategic plan and is designed to align the executive officers' performance with the interests of the Company's shareholders and also encourage retention. In particular, awards will only vest each year if the Company achieves positive operating income, and the amount of the awards that vest will be based on attainment of the Company's return on net assets goals.
The Prior Disclosure indicated that these performance based grants and awards would be made on January 3, 2012, based on the closing market price of the Company's common stock. Accordingly, on January 3, 2012 grants were made under the LTI Plan for each yearly performance period (2012, 2013 and 2014). Each of Yuval Wasserman, President of Thin Films Business Unit, Danny Herron, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Thomas McGimpsey, Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and General Counsel was granted 50,906 performance stock options and awarded 59,392 performance units for each performance period under the LTI Plan, which represent the maximum amount of such awards that may vest each year if the Company were to achieve the applicable annual stretch goal for return on net assets ("RONA"). This represents a total of 152,718  performance stock options granted and 178,176 performance units awarded to each named executive officer identified above for all three one-year performance periods. The RONA goals that have been established for the three years significantly exceed the prior three year average RONA performance levels for the Company.

Exhibit 99.1
Financial News Release
 
 
 
 
 
 Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011. The company posted fourth quarter sales of $112.5 million compared to $148.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 and $128.5 million in the third quarter of 2011. Loss from continuing operations was $2.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, income generated from operations was 1.0% of sales, and earnings from our continuing operations on a per share basis was $0.01. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of the $4.2 million restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter. A reconciliation of non-GAAP income from operations and per share earnings is provided in the tables. We also generated $6.3 million in cash during the quarter before the share repurchase of $18 million.
Fort Collins, Colo., January 30, 2012
"During the fourth quarter we made great strides executing on our strategic plan by consolidating facilities, redesigning incentive plans and repurchasing stock and we are well on our way to achieving our initial goals and exceeding our cost savings targets," said Garry Rogerson, chief executive officer. "While market conditions remain uncertain in the near-term, our focus is centered on accomplishing the objectives we laid out at our analyst day to realign our cost structure, accelerate revenue growth and effectively utilize our cash. Once implemented, these actions should improve our profitability and deliver exceptional value to our shareholders."
Thin Films Business Unit
Thin Films sales declined 29.1% to $54.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 from $76.8 million in the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to continued weak market conditions in solar panel and flat panel displays. In general, capital spending across all of our thin films end markets weakened this quarter. Year-over-year, Thin Films sales declined from $97.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Solar Energy Business Unit
Solar Energy sales were $58.1 million in the quarter, an increase of 12.3% from $51.7 million in both the third quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010. The strongest area of growth continues to be in the utility-scale market where our Solaron inverters have been selected on some of the largest projects in North America.
Income/Loss from Continuing Operations
Loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $2.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $19.7 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the same period last year and income from continuing operations of $7.2 million or $0.16 in the third quarter of 2011. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the restructuring charge, continuing operations generated income for the fourth quarter of 2011 of $0.5 million or per share earnings of $0.01.
Restructuring Charge
During the fourth quarter, the company incurred $4.2 million in charges related to the restructuring plan that was announced on September 28, 2011. Under the first phase of the plan, the company consolidated certain facilities and began aligning its engineering resources with the geographic footprint of its customer base by localizing R&D within the major geographies it serves. During the quarter, the company also started the transfer of manufacturing of certain solar inverter subcomponents to its Shenzhen, China factory. These and other efforts have resulted in savings from the first phase of the restructuring of approximately $12 million annually.
The second phase is expected to be implemented over the next 9 to 15 months as the company further reduces its cost structure, closes facilities, and relocates other functions to different regions worldwide. As a result, the company anticipates further charges in the amount of $4 to $8 million, principally for space consolidation, and another $1 million in additional severance costs over this timeframe. Once complete, the two phases of the restructuring plan, along with other cost savings initiatives and margin improvements, are expected to deliver annual savings higher than the originally anticipated $16 to $20 million.
First Quarter 2012 Guidance
The Company anticipates first quarter 2012 results from continuing operations to be within the following ranges:

Founded in 1981, Advanced Energy is headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado, with dedicated support and service locations around the world. For more information, go to www.advanced-energy.com.
This release includes GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and per share earnings data. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, similar measures calculated under generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Advanced Energy believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the Company believes that these non-GAAP measures, in combination with its financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provides investors with additional perspective. The Company further believes that the items excluded from certain non-GAAP measures do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred, even though some of these excluded items may be incurred and reflected in the Company's GAAP financial results in the foreseeable future. The use of non-GAAP measures has limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with its results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and these measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
For additional information on the items excluded from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit Index

Dear Stockholders,
Less than a year into my tenure at Advanced Energy, I see a company with many of the crucial components for future success. With 30 years of focus on power conversion and control, the company's innovative technology is among the best in the industry. Together with its world-class manufacturing facility, the company's power supplies are being used to propel next-generation designs. The commitment to precision, high quality products and extremely fast and reliable service worldwide has made Advanced Energy a leading supplier to a variety of industries, and in particular, the demanding semiconductor market. These assets have also ideally positioned Advanced Energy within - one of the fastest growing solar inverter markets - the U.S.
We now need to take the company to the next level - so that Advanced Energy's power supplies are known worldwide as the leading, dependable technology solutions in all of our markets. First, it is essential that we get closer to our customers, increase the potential applications for our Thin Film power products and expand the geographical markets for our Solar Energy products. Next, we must manage the cycles of our Thin Films business such that we can achieve more leverage at the peaks and better withstand the troughs of capital investment cycles, ultimately improving profitability. Additionally, in our Solar Energy business, we need to create a more profitable operating model while confronting an increasingly competitive environment. Finally, we must utilize our cash more effectively in order to accelerate profitable revenue growth and return value to our stockholders. These goals make up the key components of our three-year strategic plan - i) margin improvement, ii) revenue growth and iii) cash utilization. With bold financial aspirations, we have set the stage to transform Advanced Energy.
Beginning with the new short-term and long-term compensation plans that we put in place last quarter, our goal is to target consistent, long-term, profitable revenue growth and cash generation. The long-term compensation plan should reduce dilution from 4% to 1.5% and both plans should positively impact our profitability over the next few years. Redesigned to better align the interests of our stockholders with the interests of our leadership team and reinforce the pay-for-performance structure, the plans reiterate the importance of long-term incentives in achieving our objectives and attracting, motivating and retaining key talent. To this end, we are also implementing extensive employee training programs as we transition our culture to one more focused on growth and profitability.
Next, the alignment of manufacturing and engineering should position us to more efficiently use our resources and locate them closer to our customers. In leveraging and centralizing our world-class manufacturing in China, our goal is to lower our product cost, enable local sourcing and further outsource to low-cost regions. By creating local R&D teams such as the one established last quarter in San Jose, California, we aim not only to reduce our time to market, but also to increase our responsiveness and better anticipate customer needs. We plan to open a similar location in South Korea in 2012. A recent example of Advanced Energy's commitment to its customers was its recognition by Oerlikon as the 2011 Supplier Award for On-Time Delivery. Our global team worked closely with Oerlikon to meet its high volume demand. From February through October 2011, we achieved 100% on-time delivery with Oerlikon, exemplifying the success of our global operations and the investment we have made in building strong customer relationships.
Additionally, we plan to actively explore new avenues of organic and inorganic growth to accelerate revenues and increase earnings per share. In the Thin Films business, we have plans to develop new applications and broaden the use of existing applications for adjacent markets. In the Solar Energy business, we further plan to extend our target markets to include a number of emerging geographies with our growing product line.
We aim to utilize our cash in the most effective way possible to accelerate these expansion efforts. When not otherwise deployed, we will return cash to our stockholders through the $75 million share repurchase plan that we announced at the end of November. As of the end of February, we had repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of stock for an aggregate price of $35.3 million.
Ultimately, we are striving to reduce the breakeven point of both of our business units and to operate more profitably regardless of cycle or market stage. Two quarters into our restructuring plan, I am pleased to report that we have achieved annual cost savings of approximately $26 million as of March 20, 2012 and we are putting the necessary measures in place so that these costs do not return. With many of the obvious cost reductions behind us and a keener focus on costs, we now move on to the more difficult task of improving manufacturing costs and gross margins and creating a more customer-focused organization. We have taken a number of actions that collectively should enable the company to more efficiently use its resources, manage the cyclicality of its markets, promote greater profitability in each business unit and offer greater transparency to investors.
Looking back, 2011 marked the beginning of a transformation at Advanced Energy. Though our markets face a number of challenges in 2012 - from cyclical lows in thin films markets, to competition in emerging solar inverter markets - we plan to apply the same financial discipline that we have instituted in our business in the last several months to build upon our technology and lead the charge into new markets, while focusing on long-term profitable growth and returning value to our stockholders over the next few years. With these steps, I believe Advanced Energy has a bright future and a unique opportunity to advance its leading position in the power conversion markets. I look forward to reporting on our progress in the year ahead.

Chief Executive Officer

Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On April 27, 2011, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the "
Company
") appointed Gordon Tredger, President of the Solar Energy business unit, effective immediately. Mr. Tredger joined the Company in December 2011 as Executive Vice President, Solar Energy business unit. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Tredger was Executive Vice President of Operations in the Chemical Analysis Division of Bruker Daltontics, a leading provider of high-performance scientific instruments and solutions, from May 2010 through December 2010. From March 2006 through May 2010, Mr. Tredger was Vice President of Analytical Instruments at Varian, Inc., a leading worldwide supplier of scientific instrumentation that was acquired by Agilent Technologies in May 2010.
Mr. Tredger's annual base salary as President of the Solar Energy business unit is $260,000. Mr. Tredger is also eligible to participate in the Company's 2012-2014 long term incentive plan ("LTI Plan") which covers three one-year performance periods, and the short term incentive plan ("STI Plan") which covers annual performance periods, starting in 2012. The LTI Plan is a performance-based equity plan under the Company 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, with performance stock options and performance restricted stock units vesting based upon the return on net assets achieved by the Company during each year of the LTI Plan. The STI Plan provides the Company's executive officers and other key members of management who are selected to participate in the STI Plan with the opportunity to earn a cash bonus based on achievement of weighted performance metrics of revenue, operating income and cash flow for the Thin Films business unit, Solar Energy business unit and/or Company as a whole, as determined for each participant. The target bonus for Mr. Tredger is 75% of his base salary. On January 3, 2012, Mr. Tredger was granted 50,906 performance stock options and awarded 59,392 performance units for each performance period under the LTI Plan, which represent the maximum amount of such awards that may vest each year if the Company were to achieve the applicable annual stretch goal for return on net assets ("RONA"). This represents a total of 152,718  performance stock options granted and 178,176 performance restricted stock units awarded to Mr. Tredger for all three one-year performance periods.
     Mr. Tredger will report to Garry Rogerson, chief executive officer, and his employment is at will. Mr. Tredger previously entered into the Company's standard ethical and confidentiality agreements with the Company. He continues to be eligible for standard benefits.
     The Company and Mr. Tredger also entered into an Executive Change in Control Agreement, effective April 30, 2012 ("
CIC Agreement
"). The term of the CIC Agreement ends April 29, 2013, subject to automatic renewal for successive additional one-year periods. If the Company terminates Mr. Tredger's employment without Cause or if Mr. Tredger terminates his employment for Good Reason upon or within 6 months following a Change in Control (as such capitalized terms are defined in the agreement), then Mr. Tredger will be entitled to the following severance: (i) his then current base salary and target bonus, (ii) continuation of health benefits for up to 18 months, (iii) full vesting of all unvested equity awards, (iv) a payment equal to the contributions that would have been made for his benefit under the Company's retirement plans if his employment had continued for an additional 12 months; and (v) reimbursement for outplacement services up to $15,000. The summary of the CIC Agreement is qualified by reference to the text of the CIC Agreement that is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

The arbitrator(s) shall be empowered to decide any disputes regarding the scope of discovery. The award rendered by the arbitrator(s) shall be final and binding upon both parties. The arbitration shall be conducted in Larimer County in the State of Colorado.

months after the end of the year in which employment terminates and amounts payable as reimbursements of expenses to the Executive must be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which such expense was incurred.
               (b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if (A) on the date of termination of Executive's employment with the Company or a subsidiary, any of the Company's stock is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the Code)), (B) if Executive is determined to be a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, (C) the payments exceed the amounts permitted to be paid pursuant to Treasury Regulations section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) and (D) such delay is required to avoid the imposition of the tax set forth in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code, as a result of such termination, the Executive would receive any payment that, absent the application of this Section 9(b), would be subject to interest and additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then no such payment shall be payable prior to the date that is the earliest of (1) six (6) months after the Executive's termination date, (2) the Executive's death or (3) such other date as will cause such payment not to be subject to such interest and additional tax (with a catch-up payment equal to the sum of all amounts that have been delayed to be made as of the date of the initial payment).
          (c) It is the intention of the parties that payments or benefits payable under this Agreement not be subject to the additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

          (e) Wherever payments under this Agreement are to be made in installments, each such installment shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A.

Financial News Release
        
                    
ADVANCED ENERGY ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Fort Collins, Colo., April 30, 2012
- Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012. The company posted first quarter sales of $105.8 million compared to $112.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $137.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. Income from continuing operations was $0.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $2.4 million and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations was $0.06. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of $2.6 million in restructuring charges recorded in the first quarter. A reconciliation of non-GAAP income from continuing operations and earnings per share is provided in the tables. We ended the quarter with $150.7 million in cash and investments, having generated $29.4 million of cash during the quarter excluding the share repurchase of $21.9 million.
Exiting the first quarter we further reduced our cost structure and lowered our breakeven in both our Thin Films and Solar Energy business units, said Garry Rogerson, chief executive officer. With most of the immediate cost reductions behind us and programs in place to better utilize our cash, we are moving ahead with the next stage of our strategic plan to improve manufacturing costs and accelerate long-term, profitable revenue growth. We remain optimistic about our growth prospects, which coupled with our ongoing cost reduction efforts should improve profitability and deliver value to our shareholders.
Thin Films Business Unit
Thin Films sales increased 11.0% to $60.4 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $54.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, due to strong sales to the semiconductor market. Year-over-year, Thin Films sales declined 39.7%, from $100.1 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Solar Energy Business Unit
    
Solar Energy sales were $45.4 million in the seasonally weak first quarter, a decrease of 21.8% from $58.1 million in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis Solar Energy sales increased 20.9% from $37.6 million due to large scale deployments in North America.
Income/Loss from Continuing Operations
Income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $18.8 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the same period last year and loss from continuing operations of $2.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the restructuring charge, income from continuing operations was $2.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share up from $0.5 million or $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Restructuring Charge
The company incurred $2.6 million in charges this quarter related to the restructuring plan that was announced on September 28, 2011. During the quarter the company exited certain facilities, implemented its redesigned compensation plan and made further progress on the transfer of manufacturing of certain solar inverter subcomponents to its Shenzhen, China factory, resulting in annualized savings of approximately $14 million.
The remainder of the restructuring plan is expected to be implemented over the next 6 to 12 months as the company further reduces its cost structure, closes facilities, and relocates other functions to different regions worldwide. As a result, the company anticipates further charges in the amount of $2 to $6 million, principally for space consolidation, and another $1 million in additional severance costs over this timeframe. Once complete, the restructuring plan, along with other cost savings initiatives and margin improvements, is currently expected to deliver annual savings in excess of $30 million, well ahead of our original plan.
Second Quarter 2012 Guidance
    
The company anticipates second quarter 2012 results from continuing operations to be within the following ranges:

In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Advanced Energy believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, the company believes that these non-GAAP measures, in combination with its financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provides investors with additional perspective. .

non-GAAP measures has limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with its results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and these measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.

Financial News Release
ADVANCED ENERGY ANNOUNCES SECOND QUARTER RESULTS
Fort Collins, Colo., July 30, 2012
- Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2012. The company posted second quarter sales of $115.7 million compared to $105.8 million in the first quarter of 2012 and $138.2 million in the second quarter of 2011. Income from continuing operations was $8.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $7.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share. The non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of a $1.5 million after tax gain from the sale of mass flow control manufacturing assets and a $0.1 million restructuring gain. A reconciliation of non-GAAP income from continuing operations and earnings per share is provided in the tables below. The company ended the quarter with $149.0 million in cash and marketable securities, having generated $33.5 million of cash during the quarter, excluding share repurchases of $35.2 million.
Second quarter results were highlighted by the sound profitability we achieved in both of our business units, said Garry Rogerson, chief executive officer. With a record backlog and a strong pipeline of opportunities, our Solar Energy business continues to gain momentum in the North American market, which should help to offset some of the cyclicality in our Thin Films markets. Our goal of building a sustainable, profitable business is coming to fruition as we remain focused on managing our costs, expanding our market presence and growing revenues.
Thin Films Business Unit
Thin Films sales increased 7% to $64.8 million in the second quarter of 2012 from $60.4 million in the first quarter of 2012, due to an increase in non-semiconductor sales. Thin Films sales declined 33% from $97.3 million in the second quarter of 2011, reflecting lower levels of capital investment by companies in the Thin Film markets.
Solar Energy Business Unit
    
Solar Energy sales were $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 12% from $45.4 million in the first quarter of 2012. Solar Energy sales increased 24% from $40.8 million in the second quarter of 2011 due to utility-scale deployments in North America.
Income from Continuing Operations
Income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $8.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $13.5 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the same period last year and income from continuing operations of $0.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. In the second quarter of 2012, operating expenses (excluding restructuring) decreased $4.0 million sequentially, aided by a reduction in incentive accrual and to a lesser extent a reduction in other operating expenses. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the restructuring benefit and the one-time gain on the sale of mass flow control manufacturing assets, income from continuing operations was $7.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share, up from $2.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012.
Restructuring
During the quarter the company made further progress on the transfer of manufacturing of certain solar inverter subcomponents to its Shenzhen, China factory.
The remainder of the restructuring plan is expected to be implemented over the next 3 to 9 months as the company further reduces its cost structure by consolidating certain facilities and centralizing other activities. As a result, the company anticipates further charges in the amount of $2 to $6 million, principally for consolidating locations, and another $2 to $3 million in additional severance costs over this timeframe. Once complete, the restructuring plan, along with other cost savings initiatives and margin improvements, is currently expected to deliver annual savings in excess of $30 million, well ahead of our original plan.
Third Quarter 2012 Guidance
    
The company anticipates third quarter 2012 results from continuing operations to be within the following ranges:

Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On October 12, 2012, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the 
Company
) entered into a Credit Agreement (the 
Credit Agreement
) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (
Wells Fargo
), as agent for and on behalf of certain lenders (each a 
Lender
), which provides for a new secured revolving credit facility of up to $50 million (the 
Credit Facility
). In addition to the Company, AE Solar Energy, Inc. (
AE Solar
) and Sekidenko, Inc. (
Sekidenko
), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, are parties to the Credit Agreement and borrowers thereunder (collectively with the Company, the 
Borrowers
).
The Credit Facility provides the Borrowers with the ability to borrow up to $50 million, although the amount of the Credit Facility may be increased by an additional $25 million up to a total of $75 million subject to receipt of lender commitments and other conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to a borrowing base based upon the Company's accounts receivable and inventory and are available for various corporate purposes, including general working capital, capital expenditures, and certain permitted acquisitions. The Credit Agreement also permits the Borrowers to issue letters of credit. The maturity date of the Credit Facility is October 12, 2017.
The Borrowers may elect that the loans comprising each borrowing bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either: (a) a base rate plus between one-half (0.5%) and one (1.0%) full percentage point depending on the amount available for additional draws under the Credit Facility (
Base Rate Loan
); or (b) the LIBOR rate then in effect plus between one and one-half (1.5%) and two (2.0%) percentage points depending on the amount available for additional draws under the Credit Facility. The base rate for any Base Rate Loan will be the greatest of the federal funds rate plus one-half (0.5%) percentage point; the one-month LIBOR rate plus one (1.0%) percentage point; and Wells Fargo's prime rate then in effect.
Pursuant to a Guaranty and Security Agreement (the 
GS Agreement
), Borrowings under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by Aera Corporation (
Aera
) and AEI US Subsidiary, Inc. (
AEI US
), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (collectively the 
Guarantors
). Under the GS Agreement, the Borrowers and the Guarantors granted the Lenders a security interest in certain, but not all, of the Borrowers' and the Guarantors' assets.
The Credit Agreement requires the Borrowers to pay certain fees to the Lenders, including a closing fee in the amount of $250,000, a $2,500 collateral management fee for each month that the Credit Facility is in place, and a fee based on the unused amount of the Credit Facility. In addition, if the Credit Agreement is terminated by the Borrowers within one (1) year the Borrowers will be obligated to pay an early termination fee equal to one percent (1%) of the maximum amount that may be drawn or borrowed under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, which, among other things, require the Borrowers to deliver to the Lenders specified quarterly and annual financial information, and limit the Borrowers and the Guarantors, subject to various exceptions and thresholds, from, among other things,: (i) creating liens on their assets; (ii) merging with other companies or engaging in other extraordinary corporate transactions; (iii) selling certain assets or properties; (iv) entering into transactions with affiliates; (v) making certain types of investments; (vi) changing the nature of its business; and (vii) paying certain distributions or certain other payments to affiliates. Additionally, during any period in which $12.5 million or less is available to the Borrowers under the Credit Facility and for sixty (60) days thereafter, the Credit Agreement requires the maintenance of a defined consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio.
Subject to certain conditions, the Credit Agreement permits voluntary prepayment of principal and accrued interest, and contains various events of default, which are described therein. If an event of default occurs under the Credit Agreement, the Lenders may accelerate the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement and exercise other remedies subject, in certain instances, to the expiration of an applicable cure period. The Credit Agreement also contains various other provisions customary in agreements pertaining to credit facilities, including representations and warranties and covenants.
The description of each of the Credit Agreement and the GS Agreement set forth in this Item 1.01 are qualified in their entirety by reference to the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement and the GS Agreement, as the case may be, filed as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, respectively. A copy of the press release announcing this agreement is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation Under an Off-balance Sheet Arrangement of the Registrant.
The information set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated by reference in its entirety into this Item 2.03.

. In the case of a request for a Revolving Loan and so long as either (1) the aggregate amount of Swing Loans made since the last Settlement Date,
minus
all payments or other amounts applied to Swing Loans since the last Settlement Date, plus the amount of the requested Swing Loan does not exceed 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount, or (1) Swing Lender, in its sole discretion, agrees to make a Swing Loan notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, Swing Lender shall make a Revolving Loan denominated in US Dollars (any such Revolving Loan made by Swing Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.3(b)
being referred to as a 
Swing Loan
 and all such Revolving Loans being referred to as 
Swing Loans
) available to Borrowers on the Funding Date applicable thereto by transferring immediately available funds in the amount of such requested Borrowing to the Designated Account. Each Swing Loan shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions (including
Section 3

(c)
    
Making of Revolving Loans.
(i)
    
In the event that Swing Lender is not obligated to make a Swing Loan, then after receipt of a request for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.3(a), Agent shall notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, email, or other electronic form of transmission, of the requested Borrowing; such notification to be sent on the Business Day that is at least 1 Business Day prior to the requested Funding Date. If Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing on the Business Day that is 1 Business
Day prior to the Funding Date, then each Lender shall make the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agents Account, not later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date. After Agents receipt of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans from the Lenders, Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available to Borrowers on the Funding Date by transferring immediately available funds equal to such proceeds received by Agent to the Designated Account; provided, that, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.3(d)(ii)
, no Lender shall have an obligation to make any Revolving Loan, if (1) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing unless such condition has been waived, or (1) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date.
(ii)
    
Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender prior to 9:30 a.m. on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date relative to a requested Borrowing as to which Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to Agent for the account of Borrowers the amount of that Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make such amount available to Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. If, on the requested Funding Date, any Lender shall not have remitted the full amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount on the requested Funding Date, then such Lender shall make the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agents Account, no later than 10:00 a.m. on the Business Day that is the first Business Day after the requested Funding Date (in which case, the interest accrued on such Lenders portion of such Borrowing for the Funding Date shall be for Agents separate account). If any Lender shall not remit the full amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds as and when required hereby and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount, then that Lender shall be obligated to immediately remit such amount to Agent, together with interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day until the date on which such amount is so remitted. A notice submitted by Agent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this
Section 2.3(c)(ii)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If the amount that a Lender is required to remit is made available to Agent, then such payment to Agent shall constitute such Lenders Revolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, Agent will notify Administrative Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent for Agents account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans composing such Borrowing.
(d)
    
Protective Advances and Optional Overadvances
.
(i)
    
Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, but subject to
Section 2.3(d)(iv)
, at any time (1) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, or (1) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in
Section 3
are not satisfied, Agent hereby is authorized by Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time, in Agents sole discretion, to make Revolving Loans to, or for the benefit of, Borrowers, on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, that Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (1) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (1) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the Obligations (other than the Bank Product Obligations) (the Revolving Loans described in this
Section 2.3(d)(i)
shall be referred to as 
Protective Advances
). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the aggregate amount of all Protective Advances outstanding at any one time shall not exceed 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount.
(ii)
    
Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, but subject to
Section 2.3(d)(iv)
, the Lenders hereby authorize Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, and either Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, may, but is not obligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans) to Borrowers notwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or would be created thereby, so long as (1) after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage does not exceed the Borrowing Base by more than 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount, and (1) after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver Usage (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount. In the event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the Revolver Usage exceeds the amounts permitted by the immediately foregoing provisions, regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as practicable (and prior to making any (or any additional) intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) unless Agent determines that prior notice would result in imminent harm to the Collateral or its value, in which case Agent may make such Overadvances and provide notice as promptly as practicable thereafter), and the Lenders with Revolver Commitments thereupon shall, together with Agent, jointly determine the terms of arrangements that shall be implemented with Borrowers intended to reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans to Borrowers to an amount permitted by the preceding sentence. In such circumstances, if any Lender with a Revolver Commitment objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms of reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of the Required Lenders. The foregoing provisions are meant for the benefit of the Lenders and Agent and are not meant for the benefit of any Loan Party, which shall continue to be bound by the provisions of
Section 2.4(e)(1)
. Each Lender with a Revolver Commitment shall be obligated to settle with Agent as provided in
Section 2.3(e)
(or
Section 2.3(g)
, as applicable) for the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of any unintentional Overadvances by Agent reported to such Lender, any intentional Overadvances made as permitted under this
Section 2.3(d)(ii)
, and any Overadvances resulting from the charging to the Loan Account of interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses.
(iii)
    
Each Protective Advance and each Overadvance (each, an 
Extraordinary Advance
) shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, except that no Extraordinary Advance shall be eligible to be a LIBOR Rate Loan and, prior to Settlement therefor, all payments on the Extraordinary Advances shall be payable to Agent solely for its own account. The Extraordinary Advances shall be repayable on demand, be secured by Agents Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. The provisions of this
Section 2.3(d)
are for the exclusive benefit of Agent, Swing Lender, and the Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrowers (or any other Loan Party) in any way.
(iv)
    
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary: (1) no Extraordinary Advance may be made by Agent if such Extraordinary Advance would cause the aggregate principal amount of Extraordinary Advances outstanding to exceed an amount equal to 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount; and (1) to the extent that the making of any Extraordinary Advance causes the aggregate Revolver Usage to exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount, such portion of such Extraordinary Advance shall be for Agents sole and separate account and not for the account of any Lender and shall be entitled to priority in repayment in accordance with
Section 2.4(b)
.
(e)
    
Settlement
. It is agreed that each Lenders funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Lenders to equal, at all times, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Revolving Loans. Such agreement notwithstanding, Agent, Swing Lender, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of any Loan Party) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among the Lenders as to the Revolving Loans, the Swing Loans, and the Extraordinary Advances shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions:
(i)
    
Agent shall request settlement (
Settlement
) with the Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis if so determined by Agent in its sole discretion (1) on behalf of Swing Lender, with respect to the outstanding Swing Loans, (1) for itself, with respect to the outstanding Extraordinary Advances, and (1) with respect to Parents or its Domestic Subsidiaries payments or other amounts received, as to each by notifying the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such requested Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the 
Settlement Date
). Such notice of a Settlement Date shall include a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving Loans, Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances for the period since the prior Settlement Date. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including
Section 2.3(g)
): (1) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender that is not a Defaulting Lender exceeds such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds to a Deposit Account of such Lender (as such Lender may designate), an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances), and (1) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender is less than such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, such Lender shall no later than 12:00 p.m. on the Settlement Date transfer in immediately available funds to Agents Account, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances). Such amounts made available to Agent under clause (2) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the amounts of the applicable Swing Loans or Extraordinary Advances and, together with the portion of such Swing Loans or Extraordinary Advances representing Swing Lenders Pro Rata Share thereof, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders. If any such amount is not made available to Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled to recover for its account such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate.
(ii)
    
In determining whether a Lenders balance of the Revolving Loans, Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances is less than, equal to, or greater than such Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans, Swing Loans, and Extraordinary Advances as of a Settlement Date, Agent shall, as part of the relevant Settlement, apply to such balance the portion of payments actually received in good funds by Agent with respect to principal, interest, fees payable by Borrowers and allocable to the Lenders hereunder, and proceeds of Collateral.
(iii)
    
Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to the Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans.
Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans are outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lender any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to Swing Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. If, as of any Settlement Date, payments or other amounts of Parent or its Domestic Subsidiaries received since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lenders Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans other than to Swing Loans, as provided for in the previous sentence, Swing Lender shall pay to Agent for the accounts of the Lenders, and Agent shall pay to the Lenders (other than a Defaulting Lender if Agent has implemented the provisions of
Section 2.3(g)
), to be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lenders, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. During the period between Settlement Dates, Swing Lender with respect to Swing Loans, Agent with respect to Extraordinary Advances, and each Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount of funds employed by Swing Lender, Agent, or the Lenders, as applicable.
(iv)
    
Anything in this Section 2.3(e) to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from remitting settlement amounts to the Defaulting Lender and, instead, shall be entitled to elect to implement the provisions set forth in
Section 2.3(g)
.
(f)
    
Notation
. Agent, as a non-fiduciary agent for Borrowers, shall maintain a register showing the principal amount of the Revolving Loans, owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans owing to Swing Lender, and Extraordinary Advances owing to Agent, and the interests therein of each Lender, from time to time and such register shall, absent manifest error, conclusively be presumed to be correct and accurate.
(g)
    
Defaulting Lenders
.
(i)
    
Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 2.4(b)(ii)
, Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrowers to Agent for the Defaulting Lenders benefit or any proceeds of Collateral that would otherwise be remitted hereunder to the Defaulting Lender, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, Agent shall transfer any such payments (1) first, to Swing Lender to the extent of any Swing Loans that were made by Swing Lender and that were required to be, but were not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (1) second, to Issuing Lender, to the extent of the portion of a Letter of Credit Disbursement that was required to be, but was not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (1) third, to each Non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but, in each case, only to the extent that such Defaulting Lenders portion of a Revolving Loan (or other funding obligation) was funded by such other Non-Defaulting Lender), (1) fourth, to a suspense account maintained by Agent, the proceeds of which shall be retained by Agent and may be made available to be re-advanced to or for the benefit of Borrowers (upon the request of any Borrower, or Administrative Borrower on behalf of such Borrower, and subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 3.2
) as if such Defaulting Lender had made its portion of Revolving Loans (or other funding obligations) hereunder, and (1) fifth, from and after the date on which all other Obligations have been paid in full, to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with tier (L) of
Section 2.4(b)(ii)
. Subject to the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to Borrowers for the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such payments received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender. Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of calculating the fee
payable under
Section 2.10(b)
, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a Lender and such Lenders Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the matters governed by
Section 14.1(a)(i)
through
(iii)
. The provisions of this
Section 2.3(g)
shall remain effective with respect to such Defaulting Lender until the earlier of (y) the date on which all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders, Agent, Issuing Lender, and Borrowers shall have waived, in writing, the application of this
Section 2.3(g)
to such Defaulting Lender, or (z) the date on which such Defaulting Lender makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to Agent all amounts owing by Defaulting Lender in respect of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, and, if requested by Agent, provides adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder (on which earlier date, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any remaining cash collateral held by Agent pursuant to
Section 2.3(g)(ii)
shall be released to Borrowers). The operation of this
Section 2.3(g)
shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by any Loan Party of its duties and obligations hereunder to Agent, Issuing Lender, or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender. Any failure by a Defaulting Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall constitute a material breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle Administrative Borrower, at its option, upon written notice to Agent, to arrange for a substitute Lender to assume the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such substitute Lender to be reasonably acceptable to Agent. In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have no right to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance in favor of the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject only to being paid its share of the outstanding Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations, but including (1) all interest, fees, and other amounts that may be due and payable in respect thereof, and (1) an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of its participation in the Letters of Credit);
provided
,
that
, any such assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups or any Loan Partys rights or remedies against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund. In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this
Section 2.3(g)
and any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this
Section 2.3(g)
shall control and govern.
(ii)
    
If any Swing Loan or Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time that a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(A)
    
such Defaulting Lenders Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares but only to the extent (x) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolving Loan Exposures plus such Defaulting Lenders Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure does not exceed the total of all Non-Defaulting Lenders Revolver Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in
Section 3.2
are satisfied at such time;
(B)
    
if the reallocation described in clause (A) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrowers shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lenders Swing Loan Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above) and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above), pursuant to a cash collateral
agreement to be entered into in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, for so long as such Letter of Credit Exposure is outstanding;
provided
, that Borrowers shall not be obligated to cash collateralize any Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure if such Defaulting Lender is also the Issuing Lender;
(C)
    
if any Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to this
Section 2.3(g)(ii)
, Borrowers shall not be required to pay any Letter of Credit Fees to Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 2.6(b)
with respect to such cash collateralized portion of such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure during the period such Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized;
(D)
    
to the extent the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this
Section 2.3(g)(ii)
, then the Letter of Credit Fees payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.6(b)
shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure;
(E)
    
to the extent any Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this
Section 2.3(g)(ii)
, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Lender or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit Fees that would have otherwise been payable to such Defaulting Lender under
Section 2.6(b)
with respect to such portion of such Letter of Credit Exposure shall instead be payable to the Issuing Lender until such portion of such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized or reallocated;
(F)
    
so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swing Lender shall not be required to make any Swing Loan and the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue, amend, or increase any Letter of Credit, in each case, to the extent (x) the Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Share of such Swing Loans or Letter of Credit can not be reallocated pursuant to this
Section 2.3(g)(ii)
or (y) the Swing Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable, has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Swing Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable, and Borrower to eliminate the Swing Lenders or Issuing Lenders risk with respect to the Defaulting Lenders participation in Swing Loans or Letters of Credit; and
(G)
    
Agent may release any cash collateral provided by Borrowers pursuant to this
Section 2.3(g)(ii)
to the Issuing Lender and the Issuing Lender may apply any such cash collateral to the payment of such Defaulting Lenders Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement that is not reimbursed by Borrowers pursuant to
Section 2.11(a)
.
(h)
    
Independent Obligations
. All Revolving Loans (other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) shall be made by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (1) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (1) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligations hereunder.

(ii)
    
Unless Agent receives notice from Administrative Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, Agent may assume that Borrowers have made (or will make) such payment in full to Agent on such date in immediately available funds and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent Borrowers do not make such payment in full to Agent on the date when due, each Lender severally shall repay to Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.

In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this
Section 2.4
and any other provision contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other.

2.8.
    
Designated Account

Such early termination fee shall be presumed to be the amount of damages sustained by Agent and Lenders as a result of such early termination and Borrowers and Guarantors agree that it is reasonable under the circumstances currently existing (including, but not limited to, the borrowings that are reasonably expected by Borrowers hereunder and the interest, fees and other charges that are reasonably expected to be received by Agent and Lenders pursuant to this Agreement). The early termination fee provided for in this Section 2.10(d) shall be deemed included in the Obligations.
2.11.
    
Letters of Credit
.
(a)
    
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, upon the request of any Borrower (or Administrative Borrower on behalf of such Borrower) made in accordance herewith, Issuing Lender agrees to issue, or to cause an Underlying Issuer (including, as Issuing Lenders agent) to issue, a requested Letter of Credit for the account of Borrowers. If Issuing Lender, at its option, elects to cause an Underlying Issuer to issue a requested Letter of Credit, then Issuing Lender agrees that it will enter into arrangements relative to the reimbursement of such Underlying Issuer (which may include, among other means, by becoming an applicant with respect to such Letter of Credit or entering into undertakings or other arrangements that provide for reimbursement of such Underlying Issuer with respect to such drawings under Letter of Credit; each such obligation or undertaking, irrespective of whether in writing, a 
Reimbursement Undertaking
) with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such Underlying Issuer for the account of Borrowers. By submitting a request to Issuing Lender for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, any Borrower (or Administrative Borrower on behalf of such Borrower) shall be deemed to have requested that (1) Issuing Lender issue or (1) an Underlying Issuer issue the requested Letter of Credit (and, in such case, to have requested Issuing Lender to issue a Reimbursement Undertaking with respect to such requested Letter of Credit). Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that each Borrower is and shall be deemed to be an applicant (within the meaning of Section 5-102(a)(2) of the Code) with respect to each Underlying Letter of Credit. Each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or the amendment, renewal, or extension of any outstanding Letter of Credit, shall be made in writing by an
Authorized Person and delivered to Issuing Lender via hand delivery, telefacsimile, or other electronic method of transmission reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension. Each such request shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuing Lender and (1) shall specify (1) the amount of such Letter of Credit, (1) the date of issuance, amendment, renewal, or extension of such Letter of Credit, (1) the proposed expiration date of such Letter of Credit, (1) the name and address of the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit, and (1) such other information (including, the conditions to drawing, and, in the case of an amendment, renewal, or extension, identification of the Letter of Credit to be so amended, renewed, or extended) as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew, or extend such Letter of Credit, and (1) shall be accompanied by such Issuer Documents as Agent, Issuing Lender or Underlying Issuer may request or require, to the extent that such requests or requirements are consistent with the Issuer Documents that Issuing Lender or Underlying Issuer generally requests for Letters of Credit in similar circumstances. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Issuing Lender may, but shall not be obligated to, issue or cause the issuance of a Letter of Credit or to issue a Reimbursement Undertaking in respect of an Underlying Letter of Credit, in either case, that supports the obligations of Parent or its Subsidiaries in respect of (A) a lease of real property to the extent that the face amount of such Letter of Credit or the amount of such Reimbursement Undertaking exceeds the highest rent (including all rent-like charges) payable under such lease for a period of one year, or (B) an employment contract to the extent that the face amount of such Letter of Credit or the amount of such Reimbursement Undertaking exceeds the highest compensation payable under such contract for a period of one year.
(b)
    
Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit or a Reimbursement Undertaking in respect of an Underlying Letter of Credit, in either case, if any of the following would result after giving effect to the requested issuance:
(i)
    
the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed $7,500,000, or
(ii)
    
the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount less the outstanding amount of Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans), or
(iii)
    
the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing Base at such time less the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans (inclusive of Swing Loans) at such time.
(c)
    
In the event there is a Defaulting Lender as of the date of any request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender shall not be required to issue or arrange for such Letter of Credit to the extent (x) the Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure with respect to such Letter of Credit may not be reallocated pursuant to
Section 2.3(g)(ii)
or (y) the Issuing Lender has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and Borrowers to eliminate the Issuing Lenders risk with respect to the participation in such Letter of Credit of the Defaulting Lender, which arrangements may include Borrowers cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lenders Letter of Credit Exposure in accordance with
Section 2.3(g)(ii)
. Additionally, Issuing Lender shall have no obligation to issue a Letter of Credit or a Reimbursement Undertaking in respect of an Underlying Letter of Credit, in either case, if (I) any order, judgment, or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall, by its terms, purport to enjoin or restrain Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit or Reimbursement Undertaking or Underlying Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to Issuing Lender or Underlying Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over Issuing Lender or Underlying Issuer shall prohibit or request that Issuing Lender or Underlying Issuer refrain from the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit or
Reimbursement Undertaking (as applicable) in particular, or (II) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of Issuing Lender applicable to letters of credit generally.
(d)
    
Any Issuing Lender (other than Wells Fargo or any of its Affiliates) shall notify Agent in writing no later than the Business Day immediately following the Business Day on which such Issuing Lender issued any Letter of Credit; provided that (y) until Agent advises any such Issuing Lender that the provisions of
Section 3.2
are not satisfied, or (z) the aggregate amount of the Letters of Credit issued in any such week exceeds such amount as shall be agreed by Agent and such Issuing Lender, such Issuing Lender shall be required to so notify Agent in writing only once each week of the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender during the immediately preceding week as well as the daily amounts outstanding for the prior week, such notice to be furnished on such day of the week as Agent and such Issuing Lender may agree. Borrowers and the Lender Group hereby acknowledge and agree that all Existing Letters of Credit (if any) shall constitute Letters of Credit under this Agreement on and after the Closing Date with the same effect as if such Existing Letters of Credit were issued by Issuing Lender or an Underlying Issuer at the request of Borrowers on the Closing Date. Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Issuing Lender, including the requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in Dollars. If Issuing Lender makes a payment under a Letter of Credit or an Underlying Issuer makes a payment under an Underlying Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall pay to Agent an amount equal to the applicable Letter of Credit Disbursement on the date such Letter of Credit Disbursement is made and, in the absence of such payment, the amount of the Letter of Credit Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder (notwithstanding any failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth in Section 3) and, initially, shall bear interest at the rate then applicable to Revolving Loans denominated in Dollars that are Base Rate Loans. If a Letter of Credit Disbursement is deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, Borrowers obligation to pay the amount of such Letter of Credit Disbursement to Issuing Lender shall be automatically converted into an obligation to pay the resulting Revolving Loan. Promptly following receipt by Agent of any payment from Borrowers pursuant to this paragraph, Agent shall distribute such payment to Issuing Lender or, to the extent that Lenders have made payments pursuant to
Section 2.11(b)
to reimburse Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and Issuing Lender as their interests may appear.
(e)
    
Promptly following receipt of a notice of a Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to
Section 2.11(a)
, each Revolving Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan deemed made pursuant to
Section 2.11(a)
on the same terms and conditions as if Borrowers had requested the amount thereof as a Revolving Loan and Agent shall promptly pay to Issuing Lender the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit or a Reimbursement Undertaking (or an amendment, renewal, or extension of a Letter of Credit or a Reimbursement Undertaking) and without any further action on the part of Issuing Lender or the Revolving Lenders, Issuing Lender shall be deemed to have granted to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, a participation in each Letter of Credit issued by Issuing Lender and each Reimbursement Undertaking, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such Letter of Credit or Reimbursement Undertaking, and each such Lender agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of Issuing Lender, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Lender or an Underlying Issuer under the applicable Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to Agent, for the account of Issuing Lender, such Lenders Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Lender or an Underlying Issuer and not reimbursed by Borrowers on the date due as provided in
Section 2.11(a)
, or of any reimbursement payment this is required to be refunded (or that Agent or Issuing Lender elects, based upon the advice of counsel, to refund) to Borrowers for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to deliver to Agent, for the account of Issuing Lender, an
amount equal to its respective Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to this
Section 2.11(b)
shall be absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be made notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in
Section 3
. If any such Lender fails to make available to Agent the amount of such Lenders Pro Rata Share of a Letter of Credit Disbursement as provided in this Section, such Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender and Agent (for the account of Issuing Lender) shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate until paid in full.
(f)
    
Borrowers hereby agree to indemnify, save, defend, and hold the Lender Group and each Underlying Issuer harmless from any damage, loss, cost, expense, or liability (other than Taxes, which shall be governed by
Section 16
), and reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Issuing Lender, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Underlying Issuer arising out of or in connection with any Reimbursement Undertaking or any Letter of Credit;
provided
, that Borrowers shall not be obligated hereunder to indemnify the Lender Group or any Underlying Issuer for any loss, cost, expense, or liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Lender, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Underlying Issuer. Borrowers agree to be bound by the Underlying Issuers regulations and interpretations of any Letter of Credit or by Issuing Lenders interpretations of any Reimbursement Undertaking even though this interpretation may be different from any Borrowers own interpretation or understanding. Borrowers understand that the Reimbursement Undertakings may require Issuing Lender to indemnify the Underlying Issuer for certain costs or liabilities arising out of claims by Borrowers against such Underlying Issuer. Borrowers hereby agree to indemnify, save, defend, and hold Issuing Lender and the other members of the Lender Group harmless with respect to any loss, cost, expense (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses), or liability (other than Taxes, which shall be governed by
Section 16
) incurred by them as a result of Issuing Lenders indemnification of an Underlying Issuer;
provided
, that Borrowers shall not be obligated hereunder to indemnify for any such loss, cost, expense, or liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Lender or any other member of the Lender Group.
(g)
    
Each Lender and Borrowers agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, neither Issuing Lender nor any Underlying Issuer (as applicable) shall have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit or the Underlying Letter of Credit (as applicable)) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of Issuing Lender, any Underlying Issuer, Agent, any of the Lender-Related Persons or Agent-Related Persons, nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of Issuing Lender shall be liable to any Lender or any Loan Party for (1) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as applicable; (1) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; (1) any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit or any error in interpretation of technical terms; or (1) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. Borrowers hereby assume all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided
,
that
, this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude Borrowers from pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of Issuing Lender, any Underlying Issuer, Agent, any of the Lender-Related Persons or Agent-Related Persons, nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of
Issuing Lender or any Underlying Issuer shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of
Section 2.11(h)
or for any action, neglect or omission under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document, including in connection with the issuance or any amendment of any Letter of Credit, the failure to issue or amend any Letter of Credit, the honoring or dishonoring of any demand under any Letter of Credit, or the following of any Borrowers instructions or those contained in the Letter of Credit or any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto, and such action or neglect or omission will bind Borrowers, except for any loss, cost, expense, or liability that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Lender, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Underlying Issuer. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Issuing Lender and each Underlying Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary (or Issuing Lender and any Underlying Issuer may refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit and may disregard any requirement in a Letter of Credit that notice of dishonor be given in a particular manner and any requirement that presentation be made at a particular place or by a particular time of day), and neither Issuing Lender nor any Underlying Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason. Neither Issuing Lender nor any Underlying Issuer shall be responsible for the wording of any Letter of Credit (including any drawing conditions or any terms or conditions that are ineffective, ambiguous, inconsistent, unduly complicated or reasonably impossible to satisfy), notwithstanding any assistance Issuing Lender or any Underlying Issuer may provide to Borrowers with drafting or recommending text for any letter of credit application or with the structuring of any transaction related to any Letter of Credit, and Borrowers hereby acknowledge and agree that any such assistance will not constitute legal or other advice by Issuing Lender or any Underlying Issuer or any representation or warranty by Issuing Lender or any Underlying Issuer that any such wording or such Letter of Credit will be effective. Without limiting the foregoing, Issuing Lender or any Underlying Issuer may, as it deems appropriate, use in any Letter of Credit any portion of the language prepared by Borrowers and contained in the letter of credit application relative to drawings under such Letter of Credit. Borrowers hereby acknowledge and agree that neither any Underlying Issuer nor any member of the Lender Group shall be responsible for delays, errors, or omissions resulting from the malfunction of equipment in connection with any Letter of Credit.
(h)
    
The obligation of Borrowers to reimburse Issuing Lender for each drawing under each Letter of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:
(i)
    
any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document,
(ii)
    
the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), Issuing Lender or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction,
(iii)
    
any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein
being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit,
(iv)
    
any payment by Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not substantially or strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit (including, without limitation, any requirement that presentation be made at a particular place or by a particular time of day), or any payment made by Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit,
(v)
    
any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or
(vi)
    
the fact that any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
(i)
    
Borrowers hereby authorize and direct any Underlying Issuer to deliver to Issuing Lender all instruments, documents, and other writings and property received by such Underlying Issuer pursuant to such Underlying Letter of Credit and to accept and rely upon Issuing Lenders instructions with respect to all matters arising in connection with such Underlying Letter of Credit and the related application.
(j)
    
Borrowers shall pay to the Issuing Lender, for its own account, a fronting fee equal to one hundred and twenty-five one thousandths of one percent (0.125%) per annum, which fee shall be paid monthly in advance on the first (1st) day of each month. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that any and all issuance charges, usage charges, amendment, extension, renewal and drawing charges, commissions, fees, and costs incurred by the Issuing Lender relating to Underlying Letters of Credit shall be Lender Group Expenses for purposes of this Agreement and shall be reimbursable promptly, but in any event, within one (1) Business Day by Borrowers to Agent for the account of the Issuing Lender.
(k)
    
If by reason of (i) any change after the Closing Date in any applicable law, treaty, rule, or regulation or any change in the interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority, or (ii) compliance by Issuing Lender, any other member of the Lender Group, or Underlying Issuer with any direction, request, or requirement (irrespective of whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority or monetary authority including, Regulation D of the Board of Governors as from time to time in effect (and any successor thereto):
(i)
    
any reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or shall be imposed or modified in respect of any Letter of Credit issued or caused to be issued hereunder or hereby, or
(ii)
    
there shall be imposed on Issuing Lender, any other member of the Lender Group, or Underlying Issuer any other condition regarding any Letter of Credit or Reimbursement Undertaking,
and the result of the foregoing is to increase, directly or indirectly, the cost to Issuing Lender, any other member of the Lender Group, or an Underlying Issuer of issuing, making, participating in, or maintaining any Reimbursement Undertaking or Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof, then, and in any such case, Agent may, at any time within a reasonable period after the additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced, notify Administrative Borrower, and Borrowers shall pay within 30 days after demand therefor, such amounts as Agent may specify to be necessary to compensate
Issuing Lender, any other member of the Lender Group, or an Underlying Issuer for such additional cost or reduced receipt, together with interest on such amount from the date of such demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder;
provided
, that (1) Borrowers shall not be required to provide any compensation pursuant to this
Section 2.11(k)
for any such amounts incurred more than 180 days prior to the date on which the demand for payment of such amounts is first made to Borrowers, and (1) if an event or circumstance giving rise to such amounts is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. The determination by Agent of any amount due pursuant to this
Section 2.11(k)
, as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest or demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.
(l)
    
Unless otherwise expressly agreed by Issuing Lender and Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to any Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the rules of the ISP and the UCP 600 shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP 600 shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.
(m)
    
In the event of a direct conflict between the provisions of this
Section 2.11
and any provision contained in any Issuer Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this
Section 2.11
shall control and govern.
2.12.
    
LIBOR Option
.
(a)
    
Interest and Interest Payment Dates
. In lieu of having interest charged at the rate based upon the Base Rate, Borrowers shall have the option, subject to Section 2.12(b) below (the 
LIBOR Option
) to have interest on all or a portion of the Revolving Loans be charged (whether at the time when made (unless otherwise provided herein), upon conversion from a Base Rate Loan to a LIBOR Rate Loan, or upon continuation of a LIBOR Rate Loan as a LIBOR Rate Loan) at a rate of interest based upon the LIBOR Rate. Interest on LIBOR Rate Loans shall be payable on the earliest of (i) the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto; provided, that, subject to the following clauses (ii) and (iii), in the case of an Interest Period (if any) greater than 3 months in duration, interest shall be payable at 3 month intervals after the commencement of the applicable Interest Period and on the last day of such Interest Period), (ii) the date on which all or any portion of the Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the terms hereof, or (iii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. On the last day of each applicable Interest Period, unless Borrowers properly have exercised the LIBOR Option with respect thereto, the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Rate Loan automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder. At any time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the written election of Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, Borrowers no longer shall have the option to request that Revolving Loans bear interest at a rate based upon the LIBOR Rate.
(b)
    
LIBOR Election
.
(i)
    
Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, so long as Borrowers have not received a notice from Agent (which notice Agent may elect to give or not give in its discretion unless Agent is directed to give such notice by the Required Lenders, in which case, it shall give the notice to Borrowers), after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to terminate the right of Borrowers to exercise the LIBOR Option during the continuance of such Event of Default, elect to
exercise the LIBOR Option by notifying Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. at least three (3) Business Days prior to the commencement of the proposed Interest Period (the 
LIBOR Deadline
). Notice of Borrowers election of the LIBOR Option for a permitted portion of the Revolving Loans and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section 2.12(b)(i) shall be made by delivery to Agent of a LIBOR Notice received by Agent before the LIBOR Deadline, or by telephonic notice received by Agent before the LIBOR Deadline (to be confirmed by delivery to Agent of a LIBOR Notice received by Agent prior to 5:00 p.m. on the same day). Promptly upon its receipt of each such LIBOR Notice, Agent shall provide a copy thereof to each of the affected Lenders.
(ii)
    
Each LIBOR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers. In connection with each LIBOR Rate Loan, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders harmless against any loss, cost, or expense actually incurred by Agent or any Lender as a result of (A) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (B) the conversion of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (C) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan on the date specified in any LIBOR Notice delivered pursuant hereto (such losses, costs, or expenses, 
Funding Losses
). A certificate of Agent or a Lender delivered to Administrative Borrower setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or amounts that Agent or such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.12(b)(ii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent or the Lender, as applicable, within 30 days of the date of its receipt of such certificate.
(iii)
    
Unless Agent, in its sole discretion, agrees otherwise, Borrowers shall have not more than five (5) LIBOR Rate Loans in effect at any given time. Borrowers may only exercise the LIBOR Option for proposed LIBOR Rate Loans of at least $1,000,000.
(c)
    
Conversion
. Borrowers may convert LIBOR Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans at any time; provided, that in the event that LIBOR Rate Loans are converted or prepaid on any date that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, including as a result of any prepayment through the required application by Agent of any payments or proceeds of Collateral in accordance with Section 2.4(b) or for any other reason, including early termination of the term of this Agreement or acceleration of all or any portion of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders and their Participants harmless against any and all Funding Losses in accordance with Section 2.12 (b)(ii).
(d)
    
Special Provisions Applicable to LIBOR Rate
.
(i)
    
The LIBOR Rate may be adjusted by Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis to take into account any additional or increased costs to such Lender of maintaining or obtaining any eurodollar deposits or increased costs, in each case, due to changes in applicable law (other than changes in laws relative to Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 16) occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, including changes in tax laws (except changes of general applicability in corporate income Tax laws) and changes in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors, which additional or increased costs would increase the cost of funding or maintaining loans bearing interest at the LIBOR Rate. In any such event, the affected Lender shall give Borrowers and Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, Borrowers may, by notice to such affected Lender (A) require such Lender to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for adjusting such LIBOR Rate and the method for determining
the amount of such adjustment, or (B) repay the LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender with respect to which such adjustment is made (together with any amounts due under Section 2.12(b)(ii)).
(ii)
    
In the event that any change in market conditions or any law, regulation, treaty, or directive, or any change therein or in the interpretation or application thereof, shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it unlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the LIBOR Rate, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to Agent and Borrowers and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (y) in the case of any LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender that are outstanding, the date specified in such Lenders notice shall be deemed to be the last day of the Interest Period of such LIBOR Rate Loans, and interest upon the LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans, and (z) Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect the LIBOR Option until such Lender determines that it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to do so.
(e)
    
No Requirement of Matched Funding
. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither Agent, nor any Lender, nor any of their Participants, is required actually to acquire eurodollar deposits to fund or otherwise match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at the LIBOR Rate.
2.13.
    
Capital Requirements
.
(a)
    
If, after the date hereof, any Lender determines that (1) the adoption of or change in any law, rule, regulation or guideline regarding capital or reserve requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or any change in the interpretation, implementation, or application thereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the administration thereof, or (1) compliance by such Lender or its parent bank holding company with any guideline, request or directive of any such entity regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law), has the effect of reducing the return on such Lenders or such holding companys capital as a consequence of such Lenders Commitments hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such holding company could have achieved but for such adoption, change, or compliance (taking into consideration such Lenders or such holding companys then existing policies with respect to capital adequacy and assuming the full utilization of such entitys capital) by any amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then such Lender may notify Administrative Borrower and Agent thereof. Following receipt of such notice, Borrowers agree to pay such Lender on demand the amount of such reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is determined, payable within 30 days after presentation by such Lender of a statement in the amount and setting forth in reasonable detail such Lenders calculation thereof and the assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which statement shall be deemed true and correct absent manifest error). In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lenders right to demand such compensation;
provided
that Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any reductions in return incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies Administrative Borrower of such law, rule, regulation or guideline giving rise to such reductions and of such Lenders intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
further
that if such claim arises by reason of the adoption of or change in any law, rule, regulation or guideline that is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
(b)
    
If any Lender requests additional or increased costs referred to in
Section 2.12(d)(i)
or amounts under Section 2.13(a) or sends a notice under
Section 2.12(d)(ii)
relative to changed circumstances (any such Lender, an 
Affected Lender
), then such Affected Lender shall use reasonable efforts to promptly designate a different one of its lending offices or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices or branches, if (1) in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.12(d)(i)
or
Section 2.13(a)
, as applicable, or would eliminate the illegality or impracticality of funding or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans and (1) in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment would not subject it to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially disadvantageous to it. Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Affected Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. If, after such reasonable efforts, such Affected Lender does not so designate a different one of its lending offices or assign its rights to another of its offices or branches so as to eliminate Borrowers obligation to pay any future amounts to such Affected Lender pursuant to
Section 2.12(d)(i)
or
Section 2.13(a)
, as applicable, or to enable Borrowers to obtain LIBOR Rate Loans, then Borrowers (without prejudice to any amounts then due to such Affected Lender under
Section 2.12(d)(i)
or
Section 2.13(a)
, as applicable) may, unless prior to the effective date of any such assignment the Affected Lender withdraws its request for such additional amounts under
Section 2.12(d)(i)
or
Section 2.13(a)
, as applicable, or indicates that it is no longer unlawful or impractical to fund or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans, may seek a substitute Lender reasonably acceptable to Agent to purchase the Obligations owed to such Affected Lender and such Affected Lenders Commitments hereunder (a 
Replacement Lender
), and if such Replacement Lender agrees to such purchase, such Affected Lender shall assign to the Replacement Lender its Obligations and Commitments, pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement, and upon such purchase by the Replacement Lender, such Replacement Lender shall be deemed to be a Lender for purposes of this Agreement and such Affected Lender shall cease to be a Lender for purposes of this Agreement.
(c)
    
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the issuance of any rules, regulations or directions under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith after the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a change in law, rule, regulation or guideline for purposes of
Sections 2.12
and
2.13
and the protection of
Sections 2.12
and
2.13
shall be available to each Lender and Issuing Lender regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed, so long as it shall be customary for lenders or issuing banks affected thereby to comply therewith. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, no Lender or Issuing Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to this
Section 2.13
if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such Lender or Issuing Lender (as the case may be) to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit agreements, if any.
2.14.
    
Accordion
.
(a)
    
At any time during the period from and after the Closing Date through but excluding the Maturity Date, at the option of Borrowers (but subject to the conditions set forth in clause (b) below), the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum Revolver Amount may be increased by an amount in the aggregate for all such increases of the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum Revolver Amount not to exceed the Available Increase Amount (each such increase, an 
Increase
). Agent shall invite each Lender to increase its Revolver Commitments (it being understood that no Lender shall be obligated to increase its Revolver Commitments) in connection with a proposed Increase at the interest margin proposed by
Borrowers, and if sufficient Lenders do not agree to increase their Revolver Commitments in connection with such proposed Increase, then Agent or Borrowers may invite any prospective lender who is reasonably satisfactory to Agent and Borrowers to become a Lender in connection with a proposed Increase. Any Increase shall be in an amount of at least $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. In no event may the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum Revolver Amount be increased pursuant to this Section 2.14 on more than three (3) occasions in the aggregate for all such Increases. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Increases to the Revolver Commitments exceed $25,000,000.
(b)
    
Each of the following shall be conditions precedent to any Increase of the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum Revolver Amount:
(iii)
    
Agent or Borrowers have obtained the commitment of one or more Lenders (or other prospective lenders) reasonably satisfactory to Agent and Borrowers to provide the applicable Increase and any such Lenders (or prospective lenders), Borrowers, and Agent have signed a joinder agreement to this Agreement (an 
Increase Joinder
), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent, to which such Lenders (or prospective lenders), Borrowers, and Agent are party,
(iv)
    
each of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2 are satisfied,
(v)
    
Borrowers have delivered to Agent updated pro forma Projections (after giving effect to the applicable Increase) for Parent and its Subsidiaries evidencing compliance on a pro forma basis with Section 7 for the four (4) fiscal quarters (on a quarter-by-quarter basis) immediately following the proposed date of the applicable Increase, and
(vi)
    
Borrowers shall have reached agreement with the Lenders (or prospective lenders) agreeing to the increased Revolver Commitments with respect to the interest margins applicable to Revolving Loans to be made pursuant to the increased Revolver Commitments (which interest margins may be (A) with respect to Revolving Loans made pursuant to the increased Revolver Commitments, higher than, lower than or equal to the interest margins applicable to Revolving Loans set forth in this Agreement immediately prior to the date of the increased Revolver Commitments, the 
Increase Date
)) and shall have communicated the amount of such interest margins to Agent. Any Increase Joinder may, with the consent of Agent, Borrowers and the Lenders or prospective lenders agreeing to the proposed Increase, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.14 (including any amendment necessary to effectuate the interest margins for the Revolving Loans to be made pursuant to the increased Revolver Commitments).
(c)
    
Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in this Agreement and any other Loan Document to Revolving Loans shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include Revolving Loans made pursuant to the increased Revolver Commitments and Maximum Revolver Amount pursuant to this Section 2.14.
(d)
    
On the Increase Date, each of the Lenders having a Revolver Commitment prior to the Increase Date (the 
Pre-Increase Revolver Lenders
) shall automatically be deemed to have assigned to any Lender which is acquiring a new or additional Revolver Commitment on the Increase Date (the 
Post-Increase Revolver Lenders
), and such Post-Increase Revolver Lenders shall automatically be deemed to have purchased from each Pre-Increase Revolver Lender, at the principal amount thereof, such interests in the Revolving Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit on such Increase Date as shall be
necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit will be held by Pre-Increase Revolver Lenders and Post-Increase Revolver Lenders ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Share after giving effect to such increased Revolver Commitments.
(e)
    
The Revolving Loans, Revolver Commitments, and Maximum Revolver Amount established pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall constitute Revolving Loans, Revolver Commitments, and Maximum Revolver Amount under, and shall be entitled to all the benefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from any guarantees and the security interests created by the Loan Documents. Borrowers shall take any actions reasonably required by Agent to ensure and demonstrate that the Liens and security interests granted by the Loan Documents continue to be perfected under the Code or otherwise after giving effect to the establishment of any such new Revolver Commitments and Maximum Revolver Amount.
2.15.
    
Joint and Several Liability of Borrowers
.
(a)
    
Each Borrower is accepting joint and several liability hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in consideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by the Lender Group under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and indirectly, of each Borrower and in consideration of the undertakings of the other Borrowers to accept joint and several liability for the Obligations.
(b)
    
Each Borrower, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but also as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrowers, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations (including any Obligations arising under this Section 2.15), it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and several obligations of each Borrower without preferences or distinction among them.
(c)
    
If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as and when due or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then in each such event the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligation until such time as all of the Obligations are paid in full.
(d)
    
The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section 2.15 constitute the absolute and unconditional, full recourse Obligations of each Borrower enforceable against each Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets.
(e)
    
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each Borrower hereby waives notice of acceptance of its joint and several liability, notice of any Loans or Letters of Credit issued under or pursuant to this Agreement. Each Borrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or acquiescence by Agent or Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or the addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of any Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply with any of its respective Obligations, including, without limitation, any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might,
but for the provisions of this Section 2.15 afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Section 2.15, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.15 shall not be discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.15 shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any other Borrower or any Agent or Lender.
(f)
    
Each Borrower represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower is currently informed of the financial condition of Borrowers and of all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations. Each Borrower further represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower has read and understands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. Each Borrower hereby covenants that such Borrower will continue to keep informed of Borrowers financial condition and of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the Obligations.
(g)
    
The provisions of this Section 2.15 are made for the benefit of Agent, each member of the Lender Group, each Bank Product Provider, and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by Agent from time to time against any or all Borrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Agent, any member of the Lender Group, any Bank Product Provider, or any of their successors or assigns first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any Borrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment of any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 2.15 shall remain in effect until all of the Obligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the Obligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 2.15 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made.
(h)
    
Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights of contribution or subrogation against any other Borrower with respect to any liability incurred by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any payments made by it to Agent or Lenders with respect to any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Any claim which any Borrower may have against any other Borrower with respect to any payments to Agent or any member of the Lender Group hereunder or under any of the Bank Product Agreements are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation as to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any Borrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or distribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower therefor.
(i)
    
Each Borrower hereby agrees that after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default, such Borrower will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any indebtedness of any other Borrower owing to such Borrower until the Obligations shall have been paid in full in cash. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, such Borrower shall collect, enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such amounts shall be collected, enforced and received by
such Borrower as trustee for Agent, and such Borrower shall deliver any such amounts to Agent for application to the Obligations in accordance with Section 2.4(b).
3.1.
    
Conditions Precedent to the Initial Extension of Credit
. The obligation of each Lender to make the initial extensions of credit provided for hereunder is subject to the fulfillment, to the satisfaction of Agent and each Lender, of each of the conditions precedent set forth on Schedule 3.1 (the making of such initial extensions of credit by a Lender being conclusively deemed to be its satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent ).
3.2.
    
Conditions Precedent to all Extensions of Credit
. The obligation of the Lender Group (or any member thereof) to make any Revolving Loans hereunder (or to extend any other credit hereunder, including Bank Products) at any time shall be subject to the following conditions precedent:
(i)
    
the representations and warranties of Parent or its Domestic Subsidiaries contained in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) on and as of the date of such extension of credit, as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent that such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects (except that such materiality qualifier shall not be applicable to any representations and warranties that already are qualified or modified by materiality in the text thereof) as of such earlier date);
(j)
    
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such extension of credit, nor shall either result from the making thereof; and
(k)
    
if Borrowers are not delivering to Agent a Borrowing Base Certificate on a regular basis (it being understood and agreed that a Borrowing Base Certificate is being delivered on a regular basis if Agent has received a Borrowing Base Certificate for the immediately preceding three (3) consecutive calendar months as of the date that Agent receives any request for an extension of credit hereunder), then any extension of credit shall be subject to the following additional conditions precedent: (i) Agent shall have received not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of such requested extension of credit, (ii) Agent shall have received a Borrowing Base Certificate as of the end of the most recently ended calendar month and (iii) Agent shall have completed a field examination, the results of which shall be satisfactory to Agent..
3.3.
    
Maturity
. This Agreement shall continue in full force and effect for a term ending on the Maturity Date.
3.4.
    
Effect of Maturity
. On the Maturity Date, all commitments of the Lender Group to provide additional credit hereunder shall automatically be terminated and all of the Obligations immediately shall become due and payable without notice or demand and Borrower shall be required to repay all of the Obligations in full. No termination of the obligations of the Lender Group (other than payment in full of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments) shall relieve or discharge any Loan Party of its duties, obligations, or covenants hereunder or under any other Loan Document and Agents Liens in the Collateral shall continue to secure the Obligations and shall remain in effect until all Obligations have been paid in full and the Commitments have been terminated. When all of the Obligations have been paid in full and the Lender Groups obligations to provide additional credit under the Loan Documents have been terminated irrevocably, Agent will, at Borrowers sole expense, execute
and deliver any termination statements, lien releases, discharges of security interests, and other similar discharge or release documents (and, if applicable, in recordable form) as are reasonably necessary to release, as of record, Agents Liens and all notices of security interests and liens previously filed by Agent.
3.5.
    
Early Termination by Borrowers
.

Register
) on which it enters the name and address of each Lender as the registered owner of any Loan (and the principal amount thereof and stated interest thereon) held by such Lender (each, a 
Registered Loan

(r)
    
In the event that a Lender sells participations in any Registered Loan, such Lender, as a non-fiduciary agent on behalf of Borrowers, shall maintain (or cause to be maintained) a register on which it enters the name of all participants in the Registered Loans held by it (and the principal amount (and stated interest thereon) of the portion of such Registered Loans that is subject to such participations) (the 
Participant Register
).

Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register.

Non-Consenting Lender
) or any Lender that made a claim for compensation (a 
Tax Lender

No waiver by Agent or any Lender will be effective unless it is in writing, and then only to the extent specifically stated. No waiver by Agent or any Lender on any occasion shall affect or diminish Agents and each Lenders rights thereafter to require strict performance by Loan Parties of any provision of this Agreement. Agents and each Lenders rights under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy that Agent or any Lender may have.

Any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document notwithstanding, Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender (or Bank Product Provider), and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term agent in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with reference to Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only a representative relationship between independent contracting parties. Each Lender hereby further authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent to act as the secured party under each of the Loan Documents that create a Lien on any item of Collateral. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions that Agent expressly is entitled to take or assert under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, or of any other provision of the Loan Documents that provides rights or powers to Agent, Lenders agree that Agent shall have the right to exercise the following powers as long as this Agreement remains in effect: 1) maintain, in accordance with its customary business practices, ledgers and records reflecting the status of the Obligations, the Collateral, payments and proceeds of Collateral, and related matters, 1) execute or file any and all financing or similar statements or notices, amendments, renewals, supplements, documents, instruments, proofs of claim, notices and other written agreements with respect to the Loan Documents, 1) make Revolving Loans, for itself or on behalf of Lenders, as provided in the Loan Documents, 1) exclusively receive, apply, and distribute payments and proceeds of the Collateral as provided in the Loan Documents, 1) open and maintain such bank accounts and cash management arrangements as Agent deems necessary and appropriate in accordance with the Loan Documents for the foregoing purposes, 1) perform, exercise, and enforce any and all other rights and remedies of the Lender Group with respect to Parent or its Domestic Subsidiaries, the Obligations, the Collateral, or otherwise related to any of same as provided in the Loan Documents, and 1) incur and pay such Lender Group Expenses as Agent may deem
necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions and powers pursuant to the Loan Documents.

Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless Agent shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Lenders as it deems appropriate and until such instructions are received, Agent shall act, or refrain from acting, as it deems advisable. If Agent so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Lenders (and, if it so elects, the Bank Product Providers) against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders (and Bank Product Providers).

Agent promptly will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice or of any Event of Default of which Agent has actual knowledge. If any Lender obtains actual knowledge of any Event of Default, such Lender promptly shall notify the other Lenders and Agent of such Event of Default. Each Lender shall be solely

Credit Decision
. Each Lender (and Bank Product Provider) acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of Parent and its Domestic Subsidiaries or Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender (or Bank Product Provider). Each Lender represents (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to represent) to Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such due diligence, documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrowers or any other Person party to a Loan Document, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to Borrowers. Each Lender also represents (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to represent) that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Borrowers or any other Person party to a Loan Document.

Each Lender acknowledges (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to acknowledge) that Agent does not have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis (except to the extent, if any, that is expressly specified herein) to provide such Lender (or Bank Product Provider) with any credit or other information with respect to any Borrower, its Affiliates or any of their respective business, legal, financial or other affairs, and irrespective of whether such information came into Agent's or its Affiliates or representatives possession before or after the date on which such Lender became a party to this Agreement (or such Bank Product Provider entered into a Bank Product Agreement).
15.7.
    
Costs and Expenses; Indemnification
. Agent may incur and pay Lender Group Expenses to the extent Agent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions, powers, and obligations pursuant to the Loan Documents, including court costs, attorneys fees and expenses, fees and expenses of financial accountants, advisors, consultants, and appraisers, costs of collection by outside collection agencies, auctioneer fees and expenses, and costs of security guards or insurance premiums paid to maintain the Collateral, whether or not Borrowers are obligated to reimburse Agent or Lenders for such expenses pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. Agent is authorized and directed to deduct and retain sufficient amounts from payments or proceeds of the Collateral received by Agent to reimburse Agent for such out-of-pocket costs and expenses prior to the distribution of any amounts to Lenders (or Bank Product Providers). In the event Agent is not reimbursed for such costs and expenses by Parent or its Domestic Subsidiaries, each Lender hereby agrees that it is and shall be obligated to pay to Agent such Lenders ratable thereof. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, each of the Lenders, on a ratable basis, shall indemnify and defend the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of Borrower and without limiting the obligation of Borrowers to do so) from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities; provided, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Persons gross negligence or willful misconduct nor shall any Lender be liable for the obligations of any Defaulting Lender in failing to make a Revolving Loan or other extension of credit hereunder. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse Agent upon demand for such Lenders ratable share of any costs or out of pocket expenses (including attorneys, accountants, advisors, and consultants fees and expenses) incurred by Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment, or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the extent that Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of Borrowers.

Successor Agent
. Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days (10 days if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) prior written notice to the Lenders (unless such notice is waived by the Required Lenders) and Administrative Borrower (unless such notice is waived by Administrative Borrower) and without any notice to the Bank Product Providers. If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall be entitled, with (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the consent of Administrative Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), to appoint a successor Agent for the Lenders (and the Bank Product Providers). If, at the time that Agents resignation is effective, it is acting as Issuing Lender or the Swing Lender, such resignation shall also operate to effectuate its resignation as Issuing Lender or the Swing Lender, as applicable, and it shall automatically be relieved of any further obligation to issue Letters of Credit, to cause the Underlying Issuer to issue Letters of Credit, or to make Swing Loans. If no successor Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of Agent, Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and Administrative Borrower, a successor Agent. If Agent has materially breached or failed to perform any material provision of this Agreement or of applicable law, the Required Lenders may agree in writing to remove and replace Agent with a successor Agent from among the Lenders with (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the consent of Administrative Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). In any such event, upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the retiring Agent and the term Agent shall mean such successor Agent and the retiring Agents appointment, powers, and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agents resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this
Section 15
shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring Agents notice of resignation, the retiring Agents resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.

The Loan Parties and the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, to (a) consent to, credit bid or purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, 1) credit bid or purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral at any sale or other disposition thereof conducted under the provisions of the Code, including pursuant to Sections 9-610 or 9-620 of the Code, or 1) credit bid or purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral at any other sale or foreclosure conducted by Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid or purchase, (1) the Obligations owed to the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid on a
ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims being estimated for such purpose if the fixing or liquidation thereof would not unduly delay the ability of Agent to credit bid or purchase at such sale or other disposition of the Collateral and, if such claims cannot be estimated without unduly delaying the ability of Agent to credit bid, then such claims shall be disregarded, not credit bid, and not entitled to any interest in the asset or assets purchased by means of such credit bid) and the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers whose Obligations are credit bid shall be entitled to receive interests (ratably based upon the proportion of their Obligations credit bid in relation to the aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) in the asset or assets so purchased (or in the Equity Interests of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are used to consummate such purchase), and (1) Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, may accept non-cash consideration, including debt and equity securities issued by such acquisition vehicle or vehicles and in connection therewith Agent may reduce the Obligations owed to the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers (ratably based upon the proportion of their Obligations credit bid in relation to the aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) based upon the value of such non-cash consideration.

Section 15.11
; provided, that (1) Agent shall not be required to execute any document necessary to evidence such release on terms that, in Agents opinion, would expose Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Lien without recourse, representation, or warranty, and (1) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of any Loan Party in respect of) all interests retained by any Loan Party, including, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. The Lenders further hereby irrevocably authorize (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to subordinate any Lien granted to or held by Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of any Permitted Lien on such property if such Permitted Lien secures Permitted Purchase Money Indebtedness.

Each of the Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so in writing by Agent, take or cause to be taken any action, including, the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings to enforce any Loan Document against any Borrower or any Guarantor or to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the Collateral.

if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim an exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding Tax under a United States tax treaty, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-8BEN;
(xv)
    
if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United States withholding Tax because it is effectively connected with a United States trade or business of such Lender, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(xvi)
    
if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United States withholding Tax because such Lender or Participant serves as an intermediary, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-8IMY (with proper attachments); or
(xvii)
    
a properly completed and executed copy of any other form or forms, including IRS Form W-9, as may be required under the IRC or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding or backup withholding Tax.
(b)
    
Each Lender or Participant shall provide new forms (or successor forms) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered forms and to promptly notify Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.
(c)
    
If a Lender or Participant claims an exemption from withholding Tax in a jurisdiction other than the United States, such Lender or such Participant agrees with and in favor of Agent, to deliver to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) any such form or forms, as may be required under the laws of such jurisdiction as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, foreign withholding or backup withholding Tax before receiving its first payment under this Agreement, but only if such Lender or such Participant is legally able to deliver such forms,
provided
, that nothing in this
Section 16.2(c)
shall require a Lender or Participant to disclose any information that it deems to be confidential (including without limitation, its Tax returns). Each Lender and each Participant shall provide new forms (or successor forms) upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered forms and to promptly notify Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.
(d)
    
If a Lender or Participant claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax and such Lender or Participant sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant, such Lender or Participant agrees to notify Agent (or, in the case of a sale of a participation interest, to the Lender granting the participation only) of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant. To the extent of such percentage amount, Agent will treat such Lenders or such Participants documentation provided pursuant to
Section 16.2(a)
or
16.2(c)
as no longer valid. With respect to such percentage amount, such Participant or Assignee may provide new documentation, pursuant to
Section 16.2(a)
or
16.2(c)
, if applicable. Each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of this
Section 16
with respect to its participation in any portion of the Commitments and the Obligations so long as such Participant complies with the obligations set forth in this Section 16 with respect thereto.
(e)
    
If a payment made to Agent or any Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document would be subject to withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if Agent or such Lender fails to comply with applicable reporting and other requirements of FATCA, Agent or such Lender shall deliver to Administrative Borrower and Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or as reasonably requested by Administrative Borrower or Agent, (1) two (2) accurate, complete and signed certifications prescribed by applicable law or reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Borrower and Agent that establish that such payment is exempt from withholding Tax imposed by FATCA and (2) any other documentation reasonably requested by Administrative Borrower or Agent sufficient for Administrative Borrower and Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that Agent or such Lender has complied with such applicable reporting and other requirements of FATCA.
16.3.
    
Reductions
.
(a)
    
If a Lender or a Participant is entitled to a reduction in the applicable withholding Tax, Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender or such Participant an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding Tax after taking into account such reduction. If the forms or other documentation required by
Section 16.2(a)
or
16.2(c)
are not delivered to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation), then Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender or such Participant not providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding Tax.
(b)
    
If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender or any Participant due to a failure on the part of the Lender or any Participant (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent (or such Participant failed to notify the Lender granting the participation) of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless (or, in the case of a Participant, such Participant shall indemnify and hold the Lender granting the participation harmless) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation), as Tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) under this
Section 16
, together with all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses). The obligation of the Lenders and the
Participants under this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of Agent.
16.4.
    
Refunds
. If Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes to which Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 16, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, it shall pay over such refund to Borrowers (but only to the extent of payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrowers under this Section 16 with respect to Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such a refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the applicable Governmental Authority with respect to such a refund); provided, that Borrowers, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to Borrowers (plus any penalties, interest or other charges, imposed by the applicable Governmental Authority, other than such penalties, interest or other charges imposed as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Agent hereunder) to Agent or such Lender in the event Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 16 shall not be construed to require Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information which it deems confidential) to Borrowers or any other Person.
17.1.
    
Effectiveness
. This Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective when executed by each Loan Party, Agent, and each Lender whose signature is provided for on the signature pages hereof.
17.2.
    
Section Headings
. Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for convenience only. Unless the contrary is compelled by the context, everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.
17.3.
    
Interpretation
. Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed against the Lender Group or the Loan Parties, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. On the contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and shall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of all parties hereto.
17.4.
    
Severability of Provisions
. Each provision of this Agreement shall be severable from every other provision of this Agreement for the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.
17.5.
    
Bank Product Providers
. Each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed a third party beneficiary hereof and of the provisions of the other Loan Documents for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom Agent is acting. Agent hereby agrees to act as agent for such Bank Product Providers and, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, the applicable Bank Product Provider shall be automatically deemed to have appointed Agent as its agent and to have accepted the benefits of the Loan Documents; it being understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of each Bank Product Provider under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Providers being a beneficiary of the Liens and security interests (and, if applicable, guarantees) granted to Agent and the right to share in payments and collections out of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein. In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, shall be automatically deemed to have agreed that Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation, to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of the Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established there is no obligation on the part of Agent to determine or insure whether the
amount of any such reserve is appropriate or not. In connection with any such distribution of payments or proceeds of Collateral, Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due or owing to any Bank Product Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has provided a written certification (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) to Agent as to the amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification is received by Agent a reasonable period of time prior to the making of such distribution. Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount due and payable with respect to any Bank Products, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable from the applicable Bank Product Provider. In the absence of an updated certification, Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to the applicable Bank Product Provider is the amount last certified to Agent by such Bank Product Provider as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Bank Product Provider on account thereof). Parent or its Subsidiaries may obtain Bank Products from any Bank Product Provider, although neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries required to do so. Each Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that no Bank Product Provider has committed to provide any Bank Products and that the providing of Bank Products by any Bank Product Provider is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank Product Provider. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no provider or holder of any Bank Product shall have any voting or approval rights hereunder (or be deemed a Lender) solely by virtue of its status as the provider or holder of such agreements or products or the Obligations owing thereunder, nor shall the consent of any such provider or holder be required (other than in their capacities as Lenders, to the extent applicable) for any matter hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, including as to any matter relating to the Collateral or the release of Collateral or Guarantors.
17.6.
    
Debtor-Creditor Relationship
. The relationship between the Lenders and Agent, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor. No member of the Lender Group has (or shall be deemed to have) any fiduciary relationship or duty to any Loan Party arising out of or in connection with the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, and there is no agency or joint venture relationship between the members of the Lender Group, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other hand, by virtue of any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein.
17.7.
    
Counterparts; Electronic Execution
. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission shall be equally as effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement. Any party delivering an executed counterpart of this Agreement by telefacsimile or other electronic method of transmission also shall deliver an original executed counterpart of this Agreement but the failure to deliver an original executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability, and binding effect of this Agreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document
mutatis mutandis
.
17.8.
    
Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations; Certain Waivers
. If the incurrence or payment of the Obligations by any Borrower or Guarantor or the transfer to the Lender Group of any property in connection with the Obligations should for any reason subsequently be asserted, or declared, to be void or voidable under any state or federal law relating to creditors rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (each, a 
Voidable Transfer
), and if the Lender Group is required to repay or restore, in whole or in part, any such Voidable Transfer, or elects to do so upon the advice of counsel, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that the Lender Group is
required or elects to repay or restore, and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys fees of the Lender Group related thereto, the liability of Borrowers or Guarantors automatically shall be revived, reinstated, and restored and shall exist as though such Voidable Transfer had never been made.
17.9.
    
Confidentiality
.
(c)
    
Agent and Lenders each individually (and not jointly or jointly and severally) agree that material, non-public information regarding Parent and its Subsidiaries, their operations, assets, and existing and contemplated business plans (
Confidential Information
) shall be treated by Agent and the Lenders in a confidential manner, and shall not be disclosed by Agent and the Lenders to Persons who are not parties to this Agreement, except: (1) to attorneys for and other advisors, accountants, auditors, and consultants to any member of the Lender Group and to employees, directors and officers of any member of the Lender Group (the Persons in this clause (i), 
Lender Group Representatives
) on a need to know basis in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and on a confidential basis, (1) to Subsidiaries and Affiliates of any member of the Lender Group (including the Bank Product Providers), provided that any such Subsidiary or Affiliate shall have agreed to receive such information hereunder subject to the terms of this
Section 17.9
, (1) as may be required by regulatory authorities so long as such authorities are informed of the confidential nature of such information, (1) as may be required by statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation; provided that (x) prior to any disclosure under this clause (iv), the disclosing party agrees to provide Administrative Borrower with prior notice thereof, to the extent that it is practicable to do so and to the extent that the disclosing party is permitted to provide such prior notice to Administrative Borrower pursuant to the terms of the applicable statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation and (y) any disclosure under this clause (iv) shall be limited to the portion of the Confidential Information as may be required by such statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation, (1) as may be agreed to in advance in writing by Administrative Borrower, (1) as requested or required by any Governmental Authority pursuant to any subpoena or other legal process, provided, that, (x) prior to any disclosure under this clause (vi) the disclosing party agrees to provide Administrative Borrower with prior written notice thereof, to the extent that it is practicable to do so and to the extent that the disclosing party is permitted to provide such prior written notice to Administrative Borrower pursuant to the terms of the subpoena or other legal process and (y) any disclosure under this clause (vi) shall be limited to the portion of the Confidential Information as may be required by such Governmental Authority pursuant to such subpoena or other legal process, (1) as to any such information that is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of prohibited disclosure by Agent or the Lenders or the Lender Group Representatives), (1) in connection with any assignment, participation or pledge of any Lenders interest under this Agreement, provided that prior to receipt of Confidential Information any such assignee, participant, or pledgee shall have agreed in writing to receive such Confidential Information hereunder subject to the terms of this
Section 17.9
, (1) in connection with any litigation or other adversary proceeding involving parties hereto which such litigation or adversary proceeding involves claims related to the rights or duties of such parties under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided, that, prior to any disclosure to any Person (other than any Loan Party, Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Affiliates, or their respective counsel) under this clause (ix) with respect to litigation involving any Person (other than any Loan Party, Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Affiliates, or their respective counsel), the disclosing party agrees to provide Administrative Borrower with prior written notice thereof, and (1) in connection with, and to the extent reasonably necessary for, the exercise of any secured creditor remedy under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document.
(d)
    
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Agent may disclose information concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to loan
syndication and pricing reporting services or in its marketing or promotional materials, with such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications or marketing or promotional materials and may otherwise use the name, logos, and other insignia of Parent or the other Loan Parties and the Commitments provided hereunder in any tombstone or other advertisements, on its website or in other marketing materials of the Agent;
provided
,
that
, Agent shall obtain the prior written consent of Administrative Borrower to any such disclosure, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
(e)
    
The Loan Parties hereby acknowledge that Agent or its Affiliates may make available to the Lenders materials or information provided by or on behalf of any Loan Party hereunder (collectively, 
Borrower Materials
) by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks, SyndTrak or another similar secure electronic system (the 
Platform
) and certain of the Lenders may be public-side Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Loan Parties or their securities). The Loan Parties shall be deemed to have authorized Agent and its Affiliates and the Lenders to treat Borrower Materials at any time filed with the SEC as not containing any material non-public information with respect to the Loan Parties or their securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws.
17.10.
    
Survival
. All representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of, or any accrued interest on, any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding or unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or been terminated.
17.11.
    
Patriot Act
. Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the Patriot Act hereby notifies Administrative Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act. In addition, if Agent is required by law or regulation or internal policies to do so, it shall have the right to periodically conduct 1) Patriot Act searches, OFAC/PEP searches, and customary individual background checks for the Loan Parties and 1) OFAC/PEP searches and customary individual background checks for the Loan Parties senior management and key principals, and each Loan Party agrees to cooperate in respect of the conduct of such searches and further agrees that the reasonable costs and charges for such searches shall constitute Lender Group Expenses hereunder and be for the account of Borrowers.
17.12.
    
Integration
. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, before the date hereof. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, all Bank Product Agreements, if any, are independent agreements governed by the written provisions of such Bank Product Agreements, which will remain in full force and effect, unaffected by any repayment, prepayments, acceleration, reduction, increase, or change in the terms of any credit extended hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided in such Bank Product Agreement.
17.13.
    
Administrative Borrower as Agent for Borrowers
.
Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Parent as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Borrowers (together with its successors and assigns, the 
Administrative Borrower
) which appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice signed by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower and other Loan Party hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Borrower (a) to provide Agent with all notices with respect to Loans and Letters of Credit obtained for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and any notice or instruction provided by Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to be given by Loan Parties hereunder and shall bind each Loan Party), (b) to receive notices and instructions from members of the Lender Group (and any notice or instruction provided by any member of the Lender Group to the Administrative Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been given to each Loan Party), and (c) to take such action as the Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to obtain Loans and Letters of Credit and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. It is understood that the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral in a combined fashion, as more fully set forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Loan Parties in order to utilize the collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most efficient and economical manner and at their request, and that Lender Group shall not incur liability to any Loan Party as a result hereof. Each Loan Party expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account and the Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Loan Party is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group. To induce the Lender Group to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Loan Party hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify each member of the Lender Group and hold each member of the Lender Group harmless against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Lender Group by any Loan Party or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of (i) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Loan Parties as herein provided, or (ii) the Lender Groups relying on any instructions of the Administrative Borrower, except that Loan Parties will have no liability to the relevant Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person under this Section 17.13 with respect to any liability that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person, as the case may be.

revocation is effective notwithstanding the foregoing waiver, each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that 1) no such revocation shall be effective until written notice thereof has been received by Agent, 1) no such revocation shall apply to any Guarantied Obligations in existence on the date of receipt by Agent of such written notice (including any subsequent continuation, extension, or renewal thereof, or change in the interest rate, payment terms, or other terms and conditions thereof), 1) no such revocation shall apply to any Guarantied Obligations made or created after such date to the extent made or created pursuant to a legally binding commitment of any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider in existence on the date of such revocation, 1) no payment by any Guarantor, any Borrower, or from any other source, prior to the date of Agents receipt of written notice of such revocation shall reduce the maximum obligation of such Guarantor hereunder, and 1) any payment by any Borrower or from any source other than such Guarantor subsequent to the date of such revocation shall first be applied to that portion of the Guarantied Obligations as to which the revocation is effective and which are not, therefore, guarantied hereunder, and to the extent so applied shall not reduce the maximum obligation of such Guarantor hereunder.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor expressly agrees that, in any such event, Agent without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement or notice of any kind (except a notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements and notices are hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the Code or any other applicable law), may take immediate possession of all or any portion of the Collateral and 1) require Grantors to, and each Grantor hereby agrees that it will at its own expense and upon request of Agent forthwith, assemble all or part of the Collateral as directed by Agent and make it available to Agent at one or more locations where such Grantor regularly maintains Inventory, and 1) without notice except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any of Agents offices or elsewhere, for cash, on credit, and upon such other terms as Agent may deem commercially reasonable. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notification of sale shall be required by law, at least ten (10) days notification by mail to the applicable Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification and specifically such notification shall constitute a reasonable authenticated notification of disposition within the meaning of Section 9-611 of the Code. Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of Collateral regardless of notification of sale having been given. Agent may adjourn any public sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at
the time and place to which it was so adjourned. Each Grantor agrees that (1) the internet shall constitute a place for purposes of Section 9-610(b) of the Code and (1) to the extent notification of sale shall be required by law, notification by mail of the URL where a sale will occur and the time when a sale will commence at least ten (10) days prior to the sale shall constitute a reasonable notification for purposes of Section 9-611(b) of the Code. Each Grantor agrees that any sale of Collateral to a licensor pursuant to the terms of a license agreement between such licensor and a Grantor is sufficient to constitute a commercially reasonable sale (including as to method, terms, manner, and time) within the meaning of Section 9-610 of the Code.
(b)
    
Agent is hereby granted a license or other right to use, without liability for royalties or any other charge, each Grantors Equipment and each Grantors Intellectual Property, including but not limited to, any labels, Patents, Trademarks, trade names, URLs, domain names, industrial designs, Copyrights, and advertising matter, whether owned by any Grantor or with respect to which any Grantor has rights under license, sublicense, or other agreements (including any Intellectual Property License), as it pertains to the Collateral, in preparing for sale, advertising for sale and selling any Collateral, and each Grantors rights under all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to the benefit of Agent.
(c)
    
Agent may, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for herein, in the other Loan Documents, or otherwise available to it under applicable law and without the requirement of notice to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (which notice is hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the Code or any other applicable law), 1) with respect to any Grantors Deposit Accounts in which Agents Liens are perfected by control under Section 9-104 of the Code, instruct the bank maintaining such Deposit Account for the applicable Grantor to pay the balance of such Deposit Account to or for the benefit of Agent, and 1) with respect to any Grantors Securities Accounts in which Agents Liens are perfected by control under Section 9-106 of the Code, instruct the securities intermediary maintaining such Securities Account for the applicable Grantor to (1) transfer any cash in such Securities Account to or for the benefit of Agent, or (1) liquidate any financial assets in such Securities Account that are customarily sold on a recognized market and transfer the cash proceeds thereof to or for the benefit of Agent.
(d)
    
Any cash held by Agent as Collateral and all cash proceeds received by Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral shall be applied against the Secured Obligations in the order set forth in the Credit Agreement. In the event the proceeds of Collateral are insufficient to satisfy all of the Secured Obligations in full, each Grantor shall remain jointly and severally liable for any such deficiency.
(e)
    
Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that the Secured Obligations arise out of a commercial transaction, and agrees that if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing Agent shall have the right to an immediate writ of possession without notice of a hearing. Agent shall have the right to the appointment of a receiver for the properties and assets of each Grantor, and each Grantor hereby consents to such rights and such appointment and hereby waives any objection such Grantor may have thereto or the right to have a bond or other security posted by Agent.
17.
    
Remedies Cumulative
. Each right, power, and remedy of Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider as provided for in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or any Bank Product Agreement now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall be cumulative and concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power, or remedy provided for in this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Bank Product Agreements or
now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, and the exercise or beginning of the exercise by Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider, of any one or more of such rights, powers, or remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Agent, such other member of the Lender Group or such Bank Product Provider of any or all such other rights, powers, or remedies.
18.
    
Marshaling
. Agent shall not be required to marshal any present or future collateral security (including but not limited to the Collateral) for, or other assurances of payment of, the Secured Obligations or any of them or to resort to such collateral security or other assurances of payment in any particular order, and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and in respect of such collateral security and other assurances of payment shall be cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies, however existing or arising. To the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby agrees that it will not invoke any law relating to the marshaling of collateral which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of Agents rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any other instrument creating or evidencing any of the Secured Obligations or under which any of the Secured Obligations is outstanding or by which any of the Secured Obligations is secured or payment thereof is otherwise assured, and, to the extent that it lawfully may, each Grantor hereby irrevocably waives the benefits of all such laws.
19.

Each Grantor agrees to indemnify Agent and the other members of the Lender Group from and against all claims, lawsuits and liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees) growing out of or resulting from this Agreement (including enforcement of this Agreement) or any other Loan Document to which such Grantor is a party, except claims, losses or liabilities resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification as determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Credit Agreement and the repayment of the Secured Obligations.
(b)
    
Grantors, jointly and severally, shall, upon demand, pay to Agent (or Agent, may charge to the Loan Account) all the Lender Group Expenses which Agent may incur in connection with 1) the administration of this Agreement, 1) the custody, preservation, use or operation of, or, upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Collateral in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, 1) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of Agent hereunder or 1) the failure by any Grantor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof.

THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement, and no consent to any departure by any Grantor herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Agent and each Grantor to which such amendment applies.

Continuing Security Interest: Assignments under Credit Agreement
.
(a)
    
This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Collateral and shall 1) remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been paid in full in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement and the Commitments have expired or have been terminated, 1) be binding upon each Grantor, and their respective successors and assigns, and 1) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, Agent, and its successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (iii), any Lender may, in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement, assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender herein or otherwise. Upon payment in full of the Secured Obligations, the Guaranty made and the Security Interest granted hereby shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to Grantors or any other Person entitled thereto. At such time, Agent authorizes the filing of appropriate termination statements to terminate such Security Interest. No transfer or renewal, extension, assignment, or termination of this Agreement or of the Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other instrument or document executed and delivered by any Grantor to Agent nor any additional Revolving Loans or other loans made by any Lender to Borrowers, nor the taking of further security, nor the retaking or re-delivery of the Collateral to Grantors, or any of them, by Agent, nor any other act of the Lender Group or the Bank Product Providers, or any of them, shall release any Grantor from any obligation hereunder, except a release or discharge executed in writing by Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Agreement. Agent shall not by any act, delay, omission or otherwise, be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Agent and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by Agent of any right or remedy on any occasion shall not be construed as a bar to the exercise of any such right or remedy which Agent would otherwise have had on any other occasion.
(b)
    
Each Grantor agrees that, if any payment made by any Grantor or other Person and applied to the Secured Obligations is at any time annulled, avoided, set, aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of any Collateral are required to be returned by Agent or any other member of the Lender Group to such Grantor, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, including any Grantor, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, any Lien or other Collateral securing such liability shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made. If, prior to any of the foregoing, 1) any Lien or other Collateral securing such Grantors liability hereunder shall have been released or terminated by virtue of the foregoing clause (a), or 1) any provision of the Guaranty hereunder shall have been terminated, cancelled or surrendered, such Lien, other Collateral or provision shall be reinstated in full force and effect and such prior release, termination, cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of any such Grantor in respect of any Lien or other Collateral securing such obligation or the amount of such payment.
23.
    
Survival

All representations and warranties made by the Grantors in this Agreement and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that Agent, Issuing
Lender, or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any loan or any fee or any other amount payable under the Credit Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.

Financial News Release
ADVANCED ENERGY ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS
Fort Collins, Colo., October 29, 2012
- Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. The company posted third quarter sales of $117.5 million compared to $115.7 million in the second quarter of 2012 and $128.5 million in the third quarter of 2011. Income from continuing operations was $5.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $7.6 million or $0.20 per diluted share. The non-GAAP measures exclude a $3.0 million restructuring charge taken in the third quarter. A reconciliation of non-GAAP income from continuing operations and earnings per share is provided in the tables below. The company ended the quarter with $173.7 million in cash and marketable securities, having generated $24.7 million of cash during the quarter.
The record performance of our Solar Energy business unit bolstered our results this quarter, driving higher sequential sales and profitability, and balancing out the cyclicality of our Thin Films business, said Garry Rogerson, CEO. The third quarter marked the one-year anniversary of the implementation of our strategic plan to reduce our cost structure, position us to grow revenues and more effectively utilize our cash. This quarter's results demonstrate the significant progress we have made. Our new financial model gives us the ability to profitably weather the peaks and troughs of our revenue.
Thin Films Business Unit
Thin Films sales decreased 12% to $56.8 million in the third quarter of 2012 from $64.8 million in the second quarter of 2012, primarily driven by capital spending reductions in the semiconductor market, and ongoing oversupply in the solar panel market. Thin Films sales declined 26% from $76.8 million in the third quarter of 2011.
Solar Energy Business Unit
    
Solar Energy sales were $60.7 million in the third quarter of 2012, an increase of 20% from $50.8 million in the second quarter of 2012. Solar Energy sales increased 17% from $51.7 million in the third quarter of 2011 as large scale commercial and utility deployments and growing demand in North America continued to fuel growth.
Income from Continuing Operations
Income from continuing operations for the third quarter was $5.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $8.8 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012 and $7.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the same period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the $3.0 million restructuring charge, income from continuing operations was $7.6 million or $0.20 per diluted share, up from $7.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012.
Restructuring Charge
The company incurred a $3.0 million charge this quarter related to the restructuring plan that was announced on September 28, 2011. During the quarter the company completed the transfer of manufacturing of certain solar inverter subcomponents to its Shenzhen, China factory.
The remainder of the restructuring plan is expected to be implemented over the next 3 months as the company further reduces its cost structure by consolidating certain facilities and centralizing other activities. As a result, the company anticipates further charges in the amount of $1 to $2 million, principally for consolidating locations, and another $1 million in additional severance costs over this timeframe. Once complete, the restructuring plan, along with other cost savings initiatives and margin improvements, is currently expected to deliver annual savings in excess of $30 million, well ahead of our original plan.
Fourth Quarter 2012 Guidance
    
The company anticipates fourth quarter 2012 results from continuing operations to be within the following ranges:

Financial News Release
ADVANCED ENERGY ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
Fort Collins, Colo., February 4, 2013
- Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2012. The company posted fourth quarter sales of $113.0 million compared to $117.5 million in the third quarter of 2012 and $112.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Income from continuing operations was $4.9 million or $0.13 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $6.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share. The non-GAAP measures exclude a $2.0 million restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter. A reconciliation of non-GAAP income from continuing operations and earnings per share is provided in the tables below. The company ended the quarter with $172.2 million in cash and marketable securities, having generated $110.8 million of cash during 2012.
With the majority of our restructuring efforts successfully implemented and a strong financial and operational platform in place, we begin the year focused on driving revenue growth, said Garry Rogerson, CEO. Demand for our large scale inverters in the North American market remains strong, and we continue to look at expansion opportunities. In our Thin Films business, we are beginning to see signs that point to recovery in some of our markets as the year progresses. Together, these market conditions position us well for 2014, as we remain committed to our 2014 aspirational goals and actively pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities.
Thin Films Business Unit
Thin Films sales decreased 6.1% to $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 from $56.8 million in the third quarter of 2012, and 2.0% from $54.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Sales to the semiconductor market remained flat in the fourth quarter, while declines in the industrial and service markets offset the increases in flat panel display and solar panel equipment markets.
Solar Energy Business Unit
    
Solar Energy sales were $59.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, a decrease of 1.8% from $60.7 million in the third quarter of 2012, and an increase of 2.6% from $58.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Demand for our products in the North American market remained solid despite the absence of year-end tax credits and incentives.
Income from Continuing Operations
Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $4.9 million or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $5.7 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012, and loss from continuing operations of $2.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share in the same period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the $2.0 million restructuring charge, income from continuing operations was $6.2 million or $0.16 per diluted share, down from $7.6 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2012.
Restructuring Charge
The company incurred a $2.0 million charge this quarter related to the restructuring plan that was announced on September 28, 2011. During the quarter the company consolidated certain facilities and centralized other activities.
Over time, existing cost savings along with other manufacturing cost savings initiatives and cost of goods improvements are currently expected to deliver annual savings of approximately $55 million by the end of 2014.
First Quarter 2013 Guidance
    
The company anticipates first quarter 2013 results from continuing operations to be within the following ranges:

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On April 8, 2013, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (
Advanced Energy
 or 
Parent
) and Blitz S13-103, GmbH, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Advanced Energy (
Purchaser
) entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the 
Agreement
) with Jolaos Verwaltungs GmbH (
Seller
) and Prettl Beteilgungs Holding Gmbh (
Seller's Guarantor
) whereby the Purchaser acquired from Seller, on the same date, all of the shares of RefuSol Holding GmbH (
Refusol Holding
) which owns all of the shares of RefuSol GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively and together with RefuSol Holding, 
RefuSol
). RefuSol develops, manufactures, distributes and services photovoltaic inverters.
RefuSol's 3-phase string inverters products brings new technology to Advanced Energy and expands Advanced Energy's product offering and broadens its geographic reach to position it as a global supplier. While Advanced Energy has focused on higher power levels and central inverters for commercial and utility applications to date, 3-phase string inverters provide Advanced Energy the opportunity to target and better serve the needs of commercial customers with inverters in the 8kW to 24kW range, ideally suited for rooftop and potentially larger applications. This product line offers several advantages for commercial applications including a compelling price/performance ratio, ease of installation, improved uptime and quick serviceability and flexibility and modular design. We believe 3-phase string is becoming the inverter technology of choice for this portion of the market.
Under the terms of the Agreement, Seller received 59 million Euros in cash, we assumed 9 million Euros of debt and had a working capital reduction of 1.8 million Euros. The preliminary base price is subject to a post-closing adjustment based on confirmation of the financial statements of RefuSol effective as of the closing date. Each party has agreed to pay its own expenses related to the transaction.
Additional earn-out cash and stock consideration, up to a maximum of 10 million Euros total, is payable to Seller if certain financial targets are met by Advanced Energy's Solar Energy Business Unit and RefuSol, on a combined basis, at the end of the twelve (12) calendar months following April 1, 2013. Half of the earn-out, or up to 5 million Euros, is payable in cash. The other half of the earn-out, up to 5 million Euros is payable in Advanced Energy common stock at a price of approximately $18.85 per share. The per share price was determined based on the volume-weighted average price of Advanced Energy's common stock during the fifteen (15) trading days prior to April 5, 2013. No more than 342,105 shares are issuable pursuant to the earn-out.
The Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants and provides that affiliates of Seller and Seller's Guarantor will provide contract manufacturing for up to two years following closing of the transaction. The Agreement and the foregoing summary of the Agreement have been included to provide investors and security holders with information regarding the terms of the Agreement. Neither is intended to provide any other factual information about Advanced Energy, the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Agreement were made only for purposes of the Agreement and as of specific dates, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Agreement, and may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures exchanged between the parties in connection with the execution of the Agreement. Certain representations and warranties have been made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts. The representations and warranties may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Advance Energy, RefuSol, Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Advanced Energy's public disclosures.
The foregoing description of the Agreement is not a complete description of all of the parties' rights and obligations under the Agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
The disclosure set forth in Item 1.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is incorporated into this Item 2.01 by reference.
Item 8.01 Other Events
On April 9, 2013, Advanced Energy issued a press release announcing the execution of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits.
Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements in this current report on Form 8-K concerning the acquisition of RefuSol, the future business, including expectations regarding the markets for 3-phase string solar inverters, entry into such markets, growth, and expected synergies for future periods, strategic goals and any future strategic actions, and the achievement of milestones related to the earn-out under the Sale and Purchase Agreement are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the successful integration of operations of RefuSol and associated restructuring costs; the retention of key employees of RefuSol; expectations surrounding the benefits of the RefuSol products; the total available market for 3-phase string solar inverters; expectations regarding sales of the RefuSol products; the continuation of feed-in-tariffs and other incentives in Europe and elsewhere; expectations surrounding RefuSol's fabless manufacturing model; as well as the effects of global macroeconomic conditions upon demand for such products. These and other risks are described in Advanced Energy's Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports and statements are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Copies may also be obtained from Advanced Energy's website at www.advancedenergy.com or by contacting Advanced Energy's investor relations at 970-407-6555.

Financial News Release
ADVANCED ENERGY INCREASES GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES WITH ACQUISITION OF THREE-PHASE STRING INVERTER PRODUCT LINE
Fort Collins, Colo., April 9, 2013 - Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq GM: AEIS) today announced it has acquired REFUsol Holding GmbH, a leading provider of three-phase string solar PV inverters for commercial applications. Three-phase string inverters are ideally suited for rooftop and potentially larger installations and are becoming one of the fastest-growing inverter applications worldwide. This acquisition is expected to accelerate Advanced Energy's Solar Energy revenue to greater than $400 million in 2014 and should be accretive to earnings in the next 12 months.
The acquisition of REFUsol is one of the many strategic moves that we are taking to accelerate revenue growth and profitability, said Garry Rogerson, CEO. The addition of the three-phase string inverters to our product line is very complementary, broadening our portfolio and extending our geographic distribution. Using our existing channel in North America and REFUsol's infrastructure in emerging territories including India, Asia, Mediterranean countries and Eastern Europe, we can more quickly gain access to and penetrate areas with the greatest growth prospects. Combined with our relentless focus on costs, we see this acquisition as instrumental to achieving our strategic goals and returning significant value to our shareholders.
Founded in 1997, REFUsol is a private company based in Metzingen, Germany. The company develops industry-leading three-phase string inverters for commercial customers across Europe and Asia. Its three-phase string inverter offerings range in size from 8kW to 24kW for the commercial market with leading efficiency ratings. REFUsol pursues a fabless production strategy in order to concentrate on its core competency of best-in-class technology and high quality products.
Under the agreement, Advanced Energy has acquired REFUsol for a purchase price of approximately 59 million in cash, after assuming 9 million of debt and reducing net working capital by 1.8 million. Additionally, there is the potential for an earn-out of up to 10 million, payable in a combination of cash and
Advanced Energy stock, if certain stretch EBITDA goals for the combined Solar Energy business are achieved in the first 12 months after closing.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Form 8-K that is furnished under Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto shall not be deemed filed for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Act of 1934, nor shall they be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.
On April 29, 2013, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. announced via press release its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2013. A copy of the press release is furnished with this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1.
Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities
On April 26, 2013, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the Company or "Advanced Energy") committed to a restructuring plan to take advantage of additional cost saving opportunities in connection with its acquisition of REFUsol Holding GmbH ("REFUsol").
 
Under the plan, the Company will consolidate certain facilities, further centralize its manufacturing and rationalize certain products to most effectively meet customer needs. Collectively, these steps will enable the Company to more efficiently use its resources to achieve its strategic goals.
Over the next nine months, the Company will consolidate several facilities including moving the remaining manufacturing in Bend, Oregon to its Fort Collins, Colorado facility; transfer the remaining supply chain activities of its Thin Films business unit to the Shenzhen, China manufacturing facility; and rationalize the inverter product line to most effectively meet the needs of its customers. As a result, the Company anticipates total charges in the amount of $30.0 to $35.0 million, of which approximately $7.0 million to $15.0 million are expected to be cash expenditures. The charges are expected to include approximately $4.0 million to $6.0 million of severance costs, $5.5 million to $6.0 million for space consolidation, and $20.5 million to $23.0 million for product rationalization and impairments of the intangible assets associated with the technology around those products. The actions taken under this restructuring plan as well those underway and already taken are expected to deliver annual savings of approximately $70.0 to $75.0 million.
Item 2.06 Material Impairments
In connection with the restructuring plan described in Item 2.05 above, the Company determined on April 26, 2013 that the product rationalizations included in the plan will require an impairment of the intangible assets directly associated with those products. The intangible assets were acquired with the acquisition of PV Powered, Inc. ("PV Powered") in 2010 and included technology, trademarks, and in-process research and development. The Company estimates that the impairment for these assets will be approximately $20.5 million to $23.0 million, of which none are expected to result in cash expenditures.
Item 5.03 Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
On, and effective as of, April 26, 2013, the board of directors (the Board) of Advanced Energy adopted resolutions electing for the Company to be governed by Section 141(c)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law and amended Section 25 of the bylaws consistent therewith, enabling the Board to create committees that are subject to fewer limitations on their authority. The amendment to the bylaws reflecting this revision is attached as Exhibit 3.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.

Financial News Release
ADVANCED ENERGY ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Fort Collins, Colo., April 29, 2013
- Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: AEIS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013. The company reported first quarter sales of $111.8 million compared to $113.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 and $105.8 million in the first quarter of 2012. Income from continuing operations was $6.8 million or $0.17 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $11.7 million or $0.29 per diluted share. The non-GAAP measures exclude, on an after tax basis, $2.0 million of intangible amortization, $1.8 million of stock-based compensation and $1.0 million of acquisition related costs. A reconciliation of non-GAAP income from continuing operations and earnings per share is provided in the tables below. The company ended the quarter with $182.3 million in cash and marketable securities, having grown cash by $10 million during the quarter.
We began 2013 with a sound first quarter, said Garry Rogerson, CEO. Having successfully established a highly efficient global distribution model, with localized R&D and streamlined manufacturing, we have laid the foundation for future growth. The recent acquisition of REFUsol positions our Solar Energy business for significant growth over the next two years by enhancing our product line, applications and geographic reach. While we expect this acquisition to be accretive in the next 12 months, we anticipate it to negatively impact earnings over the next 6 months. Together with the improving outlook for our Thin Films business, we are poised to achieve our aspirational goals.
Thin Films
    
Thin Films sales were $61.8 million in the first quarter of 2013, a 15.8% increase from $53.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, and a 2.3% increase from $60.4 million in the first quarter of 2012. The increase was driven
primarily by improvement in our semiconductor applications and healthy growth in flat panel display, along with increases across most of our other applications with the exception of thin film renewables.
Solar Energy
    
Solar Energy sales were $50.0 million in the first quarter of 2013, a decrease of 16.1% from $59.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, and an increase of 10.1% from $45.4 million in the first quarter of 2012. In addition to first quarter seasonality, revenue from commercial applications was slower than anticipated due to some financing and permitting delays.
Income from Continuing Operations
Income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $6.8 million or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $4.9 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012, and income from continuing operations of $0.8 million or $0.02 per diluted share in the same period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of the items mentioned above, income from continuing operations was $11.7 million or $0.29 per diluted share, up from $8.9 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Restructuring Activities
With the recent acquisition of REFUsol, the company is undertaking a major restructuring to take advantage of additional cost saving opportunities. These activities will include the consolidation of certain facilities, product rationalization and further centralization of manufacturing. As a result, the company anticipates a second quarter restructuring charge of approximately $23 to $26 million, of which $20 to $23 million will be non-cash in nature. The total planned charges for this new initiative incurred over the next 9 months will be in the range of $30 to $35 million, of which $22 to $27 million will be non-cash in nature. We expect this restructuring to provide additional cost savings in the range of $18 to $20 million annually, including approximately $14 million of cash savings. The cost savings activities, along with those previously announced are expected to deliver annual savings of approximately $70 to $75 million by 2014. Completion of these activities will position us well to achieve our aspirational goals.
Second Quarter 2013 Guidance
    
The company anticipates second quarter 2013 results from continuing operations to be within the following ranges:

. 
This release includes GAAP and non-GAAP income and per share earnings data. Please note that beginning in 2013, Advanced Energy redefined its non-GAAP measures to exclude restructuring charges, acquisition -related costs, stock based compensation and amortization of intangibles. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, similar measures calculated under generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Advanced Energy believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, the company believes that these non-GAAP measures, in combination with its financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provides investors with additional perspective. While some of these excluded items may be incurred and reflected in the company's GAAP financial results in the foreseeable future, the company believes that the items excluded from certain non-GAAP measures do not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred. The use of
non-GAAP measures has limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with its results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and these measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.
For additional information on the items excluded from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the Form 8-K regarding this release furnished today to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the effects of global macroeconomic conditions upon demand for our products, the volatility and cyclicality of the industries the company serves, particularly the semiconductor industry, the acquisition of REFUsol including the successful integration of operations of REFUsol  and associated restructuring costs; the retention of key employees of REFUsol, expectations surrounding the benefits of the REFUsol  products, the total available market for 3-phase string solar inverters particularly in Europe, India and the United States, expectations regarding sales of the REFUsol  products, the continuation of feed-in-tariffs and other incentives in Europe and elsewhere, expectations surrounding REFUsol 's fabless manufacturing model, as well as the effects of global macroeconomic conditions upon demand for such products, the continuation of RPS (renewable portfolio standards), the timing and availability of incentives and grant programs in North America and Europe related to the renewable energy market, renewable energy project delays resulting from solar panel price declines and increased competition in the solar inverter equipment market, the timing of orders received from customers, the company's ability to realize benefits from cost improvement efforts including avoided costs, any restructuring plans and any inorganic growth, the ability to obtain materials and manufacture products, and unanticipated changes to management's estimates, reserves or allowances.

Item 8.01 Other Events.
     
On June 4, 2013, Garry Rogerson, the Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the Company), adopted a selling plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Plan) which provides for the sale of up to 15,000 shares of common stock of the Company beginning no earlier than November 11, 2013. Shares will be sold under the Plan on the open market at prevailing market prices and subject to a minimum price threshold as specified in the Plan. The Plan will terminate no later than November 10, 2014, even if all shares subject to the Plan have not been sold. The Plan was established as part of Mr. Rogerson's personal long term strategy for asset diversification and liquidity. Rule 10b5-1 permits officers and directors of public companies to adopt pre-determined plans for buying or selling specified amounts of stock if the plan is adopted at a time when the purchaser or seller is not aware of any material non-public information.
The Company does not undertake to report Rule 10b5-1 plans or any other stock transactions that may be adopted or effected by any officer or director, or to report any modifications or termination of any publicly announced trading plan or transaction, except to the extent required by law.
