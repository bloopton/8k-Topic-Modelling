EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS 64% INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE ON IMPROVED SALES FOR ITS THIRD QUARTER CLEVELAND, OH (April 16, 2003) - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2003 third quarter, which ended March 31, 2003. Sales were within the range of previously provided guidance while earnings exceeded the upper end of the guidance range. Net sales for the quarter were $368,203,000, up 1.8% compared with $361,542,000 in the same period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 62% to $4,383,000 from $2,707,000 last year. Earnings per share increased by 64% to $0.23 from $0.14 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. For the nine months ended March 31, 2003, sales increased 1.4% to $1,091,929,000 from $1,077,082,000 in the same period last year. Net income was $12,148,000 or $0.63 per share versus a loss of $(1,586,000) or $(0.09) per share last year. The prior year's nine-month earnings included the effect of a non-cash charge of $12,100,000 after tax, or $0.63 per share, for impaired goodwill (resulting from the initial application of SFAS 142) associated with the company's fluid power business. Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "While sales growth continues to be restrained in a weak economy, we are seeing positive results in our efforts to improve profit margins. Gross profit margin for the third quarter was 26.5%, an improvement of about 90 basis points over our second quarter result. Our gross profit improvement was driven by a broad range of management actions that included enhanced supply chain management resulting in improved vendor rebates, improved recovery of freight costs and a more favorable mix of sales. "It is particularly meaningful to note that our efforts in inventory management have allowed us to make significant gains in recent quarters in on-time performance while reducing our average inventory levels. Good asset management continues to be a key focus as we move through uncertain economic times. Our costs remain well controlled, although we did record non-operating charges of approximately $1.7 million during the quarter related to a provision for losses and loan guarantees of an affiliated company. "Our cash flow and balance sheet remain strong. Accounts receivable and long-term debt have shown year-to-year improvement. Our current ratio at March 31, 2003 was 2.9 to 1. Our ratio of debt to equity (net of cash) was 0.18 to 1. "The industrial economy remains weak across the board, with no significant rebound expected during the final quarter of our 2003 fiscal year. In fact, recent economic indicators are very disappointing for the short term.
"Looking ahead, we are maintaining sales guidance for our fiscal fourth quarter of $365 million to $375 million. However, given our efforts in margin improvement, we are raising our earnings forecast for the quarter to a range of $0.25 to $0.30, and for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2003, we expect earnings per share to be within the range of $0.88 to $0.93." For the nine months ended March 31, 2003, the company repurchased 577,000 shares of its common stock for $9.9 million. At March 31, board authorization was in place to repurchase up to 338,000 additional shares. Applied will host its third quarter conference call at 4 p.m. today (Wednesday, April 16). To join in the call, dial 1-800-946-0782 and passcode 376483. The call will be conducted by Chairman and CEO David L. Pugh, President and COO Bill L. Purser, and CFO John R. Whitten. The call will also be webcast and can be accessed live online at www.applied.com and will be archived there for 14 days. A replay of the teleconference will be available at 1-888-203-1112 from 7 p.m. on April 16 through 12 midnight on April 30. With more than 450 facilities and 4,400 employees across North America, Applied Industrial Technologies offers more than 2 million parts critical to the operations of MRO and OEM customers in virtually every industry. In addition, Applied provides engineering, design and systems integration for industrial and fluid power applications, as well as customized mechanical, fabricated rubber and fluid power shop services.

Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "expect," "believe," "guidance," "forecast," "see" and similar expressions. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, the success of our various marketing and operational strategies, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Cost of sales for interim financial statements is computed using estimated gross profit percentages which are adjusted throughout the year based upon available information. Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based upon physical inventories and the effect of year-end inventory quantities on LIFO costs. (2) During July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Effective July 1, 2001, the Company adopted this standard. Under SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer being amortized, but is tested for impairment upon adoption and annually thereafter. The Company's other intangible assets relate to non-competition agreements and continue to be amortized over the lives of the agreements which primarily are five years. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, a non-cash charge totaling $17,600, $12,100 after tax, has been recorded as a change in accounting principle effective July 1, 2001 to write-off the remaining goodwill relating to the fluid power business. The Company has established January 1 as its annual impairment testing date. The test resulted in no impairment of goodwill required to be recorded at this time.

EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REVISES FOURTH QUARTER GUIDANCE UPWARD BASED ON NON-OPERATING GAINS CLEVELAND, Ohio (July 3, 2003) - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today said it expects earnings for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2003, ended June 30, to be significantly higher than guidance provided in its April 16 news release, primarily because of non-operating gains. Management currently expects fourth quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.43 per share ($1.00 to $1.05 per share for fiscal 2003 as a whole) when year-end financial results are reported on August 8. Actual earnings within that range are contingent on results from the company's customary year-end physical inventory adjustment and year-end closing process. Previously provided guidance included an earnings range of $0.25 to $0.30 per share for the fourth quarter ($0.88 to $0.93 per share for fiscal 2003 as a whole). Applied's fourth quarter results will include a one-time pre-tax gain of $2.2 million from settlement of a property insurance claim. In addition, fourth quarter SD&A will include approximately $650,000 in pre-tax gains on the sale of surplus real estate. These two non-operating factors will account for about $0.10 per share of reported fourth quarter earnings. "While the manufacturing sector has continued to provide little, if any, increase in demand, the unified efforts of all of our associates have been able to improve the earnings potential of our company even in the face of disappointing U.S. sales," said Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh. "We have been able to sustain the positive margin movement demonstrated in our third quarter and to combine that with some one-time events whose timing were ahead of the schedule we anticipated when we issued our previous guidance. "Despite higher-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003, year-over-year sales comparisons for the company's U.S. service center-based core business weakened toward the end of the period due to continued weakness in the manufacturing economy. Thus, we remain cautious about fiscal 2004." Applied expects sales for its fourth quarter to come in at the high end of previously provided guidance of $365 million to $375 million - a level essentially flat with the comparable period last year, but slightly ahead of the third quarter. Weaker than anticipated U.S. sales have been offset by a strong performance of the Company's Canadian business. - MORE -

Exhibit 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS INCREASES IN INCOME AND SALES FOR ITS FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL 2003 YEAR END CLEVELAND, OHIO (August 8, 2003) - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported earnings per share of $0.40 for its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30, 2003, which was in line with the company's previously provided guidance of $0.37 to $0.43. Net sales for the quarter increased slightly to $372,438,000 from $369,487,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased to $7,684,000 or $0.40 per share compared to $4,241,000 or $0.22 per share last year. For the full fiscal 2003, sales increased to $1,464,367,000 from $1,446,569,000 in fiscal 2002. Net income was $19,832,000 or $1.03 per share, versus $2,655,000 or $0.13 per share in the previous year. Full-year earnings in the prior year include the effect of a non-cash charge of $12,100,000, or $0.63 per share, for impaired goodwill (resulting from the application of SFAS 142) associated with the company's fluid power business. Applied's fourth quarter 2003 results included previously announced pre-tax gains of $2.1 million for an insurance claim settlement and $650,000 for the sale of surplus real estate. Together, these items accounted for about $0.09 per share of reported fourth quarter earnings. Commenting on the performance, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "Results for the fourth quarter reflect steady improvement in our margin management during a period where sales growth is proving to be very challenging. While our domestic core business continues to be weak, we had very positive improvements in our Canadian operations and in our fluid power business. "Our industry saw demand slacken in response to the continuing economic problems in the domestic manufacturing economy, and we do not foresee any noticeable recovery in the near future. "Our balance sheet reflects solid efforts by all of our associates to better manage assets by continually improving processes. Inventories declined, and cash generation was strong. The quality initiatives in place at all levels are providing sustainable earnings growth through operating excellence. -More-
Our initial guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 is for earnings to be between $0.20 and $0.25 per share on sales of $360 to $370 million as we expect domestic markets to be flat to down slightly. For the full fiscal 2004, we see earnings between $1.10 and $1.20 per share on sales ranging from $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion." During 2003, the company purchased 581,000 shares of its common stock for $9.9 million. In July 2003, Applied's Board of Directors approved a new authorization to repurchase up to 1 million shares or approximately 5% of the currently outstanding shares. This authorization replaced the previous authorization. Applied will host its fourth quarter conference call at 10 a.m. on Monday, August 11. To join in the call, dial 1-800-810-0924 and passcode 467278. The call will be conducted by Chairman & CEO David L. Pugh, President & COO Bill L. Purser, and CFO John R. Whitten.

APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME (Unaudited) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (Thousands, except per share data)
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Cost of sales for interim financial statements is computed using estimated gross profit percentages which are adjusted throughout the year based upon available information. Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based upon physical inventories and the effect of year-end inventory quantities on LIFO costs. Fourth quarter adjustments in 2003 and 2002 increased gross profit by $4,410 and $3,171; net income by $2,682 and $1,868 and diluted net income per share by $.14 and $.10 respectively. Reductions in year end inventories during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of these liquidations for the years ended June 30, 2003 and 2002 increased gross profit by $741 and $915; net income by $453 and $546 and diluted net income per share by $.02 and $.03 respectively. (2) During July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Effective July 1, 2001, the Company adopted this standard. Under SFAS 142, goodwill is no longer being amortized, but is tested for impairment upon adoption and annually thereafter. Upon adoption of SFAS 142, a non-cash charge totaling $17,600, $12,100 after tax, has been recorded as a change in accounting principle effective July 1, 2001 to write-off the remaining goodwill relating to the fluid power business. The Company has established January 1 as its annual impairment testing date. The January 1, 2003 test resulted in no additional impairment of goodwill required to be recorded at this time.

Pugh said, "While the economic outlook remains troubling, we continue to make progress on profit levels by focusing on margin management. "Operating margin for the first quarter was particularly strong when you consider last year's first quarter results included the benefit of relatively high real estate gains. The company also had $359,000 of additional expense in this current quarter as we began to expense stock options pursuant to our election to adopt SFAS 123 and 148. All elements of our balance sheet are well under control, and we are in a solid financial position. "Looking ahead, our sales guidance for our second quarter is $340 million to $350 million, with earnings per share between $0.20 and $0.25. We are maintaining full year fiscal 2004 guidance for earnings between $1.10 and $1.20 per share with sales ranging from $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion." During the first quarter, the company repurchased 91,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $2 million.

Applied Industrial Technologies Reports Improved Second Quarter Sales, Earnings CLEVELAND, OHIO (January 13, 2004) - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported sales and earnings that exceeded guidance for its fiscal 2004 second quarter, which ended December 31, 2003. Earnings per share rose by more than 20% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $359,711,000, up 1.1% compared with $355,707,000 in the same period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 33% to $5,133,000 from $3,860,000. Earnings per share increased by 30% to $0.26 from $0.20 per share last year. For the six months ended December 31, 2003, sales decreased 0.4% to $720,857,000 from $723,726,000 in the same period last year. Net income increased 28% to $9,965,000, or $0.51 per share, compared to $7,765,000, or $0.40 per share, last year. Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "We continue to show good attention to detail in driving efficiencies in our operations. The discipline we have instilled should serve us well when the economic recovery reaches the MRO buyers. If the manufacturing sector continues on its current path, we should begin to see the benefits in our fourth quarter. "While optimism reigns, our current quarter sales trend remained similar to what we had been experiencing. Canada still is showing improvement to offset a decline of 1.5% in our U.S. same store sales compared to last year. Our operations have done an excellent job of increasing their profitability. "Looking ahead, we expect our third quarter to offer more of the same that we have been seeing with sales in the $370 million to $380 million range, delivering earnings between $0.26 and $0.31 per share. We expect to end the year in line with previous guidance of sales in the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion range and earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 per share." For the six months ended December 31, 2003, the company repurchased 96,000 shares of stock for $2.1 million.

APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS INCREASED SALES AND EARNINGS FOR ITS THIRD QUARTER, RAISES GUIDANCE FOR FOURTH QUARTER CLEVELAND, OH (April 15, 2004) - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported significantly improved financial results for its fiscal 2004 third quarter, which ended March 31, 2004. Sales and earnings exceeded management's previous guidance. Net sales for the quarter were $391,053,000, up 6.2% compared with $368,203,000 in the same period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 142.1% to $10,611,000 from $4,383,000 last year. Earnings per share increased by 134.8% to $0.54 from $0.23 per share in the third quarter of 2003. The third quarter of fiscal 2003 did include non-operating charges of $1.7 million, or $0.06 per share, to provide for potential losses on investments and advances to an affiliated company. The third quarter of 2004 includes non-recurring tax benefits primarily from a late-March settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to audits of the company's 1997 and 1998 tax returns as well as acceptance by the IRS of tax refund claims for 1999, 2000, and 2001. These items added $1,587,000, or $0.08 per share, to quarterly earnings. For the nine months ended March 31, 2004, sales increased 1.8% to $1,111,910,000 from $1,091,929,000 in the same period last year. Net income increased 69.4% to $20,576,000 or $1.05 per share versus $12,148,000, or $0.63 per share, last year. Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "Riding the tide of a strengthening economy, our sales growth across North America accelerated throughout the quarter and exceeded even our most optimistic forecasts. This drove greater-than-expected operating earnings. We are benefiting from the additional earnings potential created in our business by aggressive actions taken over the past two years to improve margins, manage assets and contain costs. Our gross margin, return on assets, and SD&A as a percent of sales all improved during the third quarter from year-ago levels. "This enhanced level of operating discipline and efficiency has allowed us to provide positive results even in a difficult economy. We will be working hard to improve our profit levels as the industrial economy rebounds. "Looking ahead, sales guidance for our fiscal fourth quarter is $385 million to $400 million. Recognizing our gains in margin improvement and cost containment, earnings per share are expected to come in within a range of $0.45 to $0.50. Thus, for the full fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, we expect earnings per share to come in within the range of $1.50 to $1.55."
For the nine months ended March 31, 2004, the company repurchased 287,000 shares of stock for $6.2 million. At March 31, board authorization was in place to repurchase up to 841,000 additional shares. Applied will host its third quarter conference call at 4 p.m. today (Thursday, April 15).

APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS 41.8% INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2004 FOURTH QUARTER CLEVELAND, Ohio, August 6, 2004 - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported its net income rose by 41.8 percent on a sales increase of 8.8 percent in its fiscal 2004 fourth quarter, ended June 30. Earnings per share rose by 37.5 percent in the quarter - the company's seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases of 25 percent or more. Net sales for the quarter increased to $405,094,000 from $372,438,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased to $10,895,000 or $0.55 per share compared to $7,684,000 or $0.40 per share last year. For the full fiscal 2004, sales increased by 3.6 percent to $1,517,004,000 from $1,464,367,000 in fiscal 2003. Net income increased 58.7 percent for the year to $31,471,000 compared to $19,832,000 last year. Net income per share was $1.60 compared to $1.03 in the previous year. Commenting on the performance, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "These financial results, among the best in our company's history, reflect operating improvements we have implemented over the past several years. As sales increases from a rebounding economy in the fourth quarter exceeded our initial expectations, we benefited from additional operating leverage that magnified the impact on our bottom line. "In particular, our efforts to control expenses and manage assets led to significantly higher operating margins and returns for both the fourth quarter and the full year. "Sales improved in all regions of North America and from most of our customer industries. We experienced especially strong increases in demand from the industrial machinery and equipment, primary metals, lumber and wood products and chemical sectors. "We ended our fiscal 2004 with a strong balance sheet. Inventories are well controlled, debt levels remain low and a cash balance of nearly $70 million provides Applied flexibility to pursue opportunities for profitable growth and enhancements to shareholder value. "Looking ahead, we expect to see year-over-year sales increases in the range of 9 percent to 11 percent for the first quarter, and between 5 percent to 7 percent for the second quarter. We expect sales increases will moderate in the second half, primarily because of comparisons to strong sales in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004. "At this point, we see fiscal 2005 sales totaling between $1.57 billion and $1.61 billion. Our initial earnings guidance is in the range of $.40 to $.50 per share for the first quarter, and $1.80 to $2.00 per share for the full year." During 2004, the company purchased 290,000 shares of its common stock for $6.3 million. At June 30, 2004, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase more than 800,000 additional shares.

APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES ------------------------------------------------------ CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME ------------------------------------------- (Thousands, except per share data) - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Cost of sales for interim financial statements is computed using estimated gross profit percentages which are adjusted throughout the year based upon available information. Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based upon physical inventories and the effect of year-end inventory quantities on LIFO costs. Fourth quarter adjustments in 2004 and 2003 increased gross profit by $3,456 and $4,410, net income by $2,131 and $2,682 and net income per share by $0.11 and $0.14 respectively. Reductions in inventories during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of these liquidations for the years ended June 30, 2004 and 2003 increased gross profit by $672 and $741, net income by $420 and $453 and net income per share by $0.02 and $0.02 respectively. (2) Effective July 1, 2003, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," using the modified prospective method for the transition. Under the modified prospective method, stock based compensation cost recognized during this fiscal year is the same as that which would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions been applied to all awards granted after July 1, 1995. The compensation expense recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was $271, ($173 net of tax) or $0.01 per share. During the year ended June 30, 2004, compensation expense recorded for stock-based compensation was $1,586, ($1,074 net of tax) or $0.05 per share. (3) During the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the Company recorded non-recurring tax benefits primarily from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to audits of our 1997 and 1998 tax returns and the acceptance by the IRS of tax refund claims for 1999, 2000, and 2001. The settlement added $1,600, or $0.08 per share, to earnings. (4) During the quarter ended June 30, 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax gains of $2,133 for an insurance claim settlement and $650 for the sale of surplus real estate. Both items accounted for approximately $0.09 per share of income in the fourth quarter.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99 Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plan entered into as of August 20, 2004 between The Moore Family 2004 Settlement Trust and Citigroup Global Markets Inc.

EXHIBIT 99 Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plan This Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plan ("Plan") is adopted by J. Michael Moore Family Trust (the "Seller") on August 20, 2004 (the "Adoption Date"), in order to establish a systematic program by which Citigroup Global Markets Inc.("Smith Barney" or "SB") will use its reasonable best efforts to sell on the Seller's behalf the shares of common stock ("Stock") of Applied Industrial Technology Inc. (AIT) ("Issuer"). A.) Sales Program 1.) The Seller's sales program consists of the following (check the applicable box or boxes): [ ] cashless exercise, i.e., exercise vested options ("Options") granted to the Seller by the Issuer, sell the Stock issued upon such exercise, and use a portion of the sale proceeds to pay the Option exercise price, as specified in greater detail in Schedule A-1. X already-owned Stock, i.e., sell the number of shares of Stock already owned by the Seller (including vested shares granted to the Seller pursuant to the Issuer's restricted share plan), as specified in greater detail in Schedule A-2. 2.) The Seller hereby appoints SB as the Seller's agent and attorney-in-fact to effect sales under this Plan. If the Seller's sales program consists of exercising vested Options, SB is granted authority to exercise Options on the Seller's behalf, and Schedule A-1 will constitute the Seller's Option exercise form. 3.) The Seller agrees to pay SB the commission per share of Stock indicated on Schedules A-1 and A-2 as applicable. SB will deduct its commission and applicable transaction fees from the proceeds of any sale of Stock under this Plan. 4.) The exercise and sale prices, and number of Options to be exercised and shares of Stock to be sold, will be adjusted following such time as the Seller or the Issuer notifies SB of a Stock split or other recapitalization affecting the Stock ("Recapitalization"). 5.) The Seller acknowledges that it may not be possible to exercise Options or sell Stock during the term of this Plan ("Term") due to: (i) a legal or contractual restriction applicable to the Seller (the existence of which the Seller shall promptly notify SB) or SB, (ii) a market disruption (including without limitation a halt or suspension of
trading in the Stock imposed by a court, governmental agency or self-regulatory organization), or (iii) rules governing order execution priority on the NASDAQ Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange (whichever is applicable). If any of these items ceases to be applicable during the Term, SB will resume its sales activity to the extent it is reasonably able to do so and still be able to provide best execution. 6.) (Check the applicable box or boxes) X The Seller is a member of the Issuer's board of directors, or is an "executive officer" for purposes of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOA"). X The Seller is subject to the requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"). [ ] The Seller is not subject to Section 402 of the SOA or to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Seller acknowledges that: (i) the Issuer may prohibit the Seller from engaging in certain types of transactions under this Plan if the Seller is subject to the SOA, and (ii) the Seller is solely responsible for complying with Section 16 of the Exchange Act in connection with this Plan, and will be solely responsible if any sales made under this Plan result in the Seller being liable for "short-swing profits" under Section 16(b). 7.) No later than three business days after a sale of Stock is made under this Plan, the Seller agrees to deposit (or make arrangements with the Issuer or its transfer agent to deposit) into an account at SB in his or her name the number of shares of Stock to be sold on any particular day on the Seller's behalf (including shares that have been issued as a result of a Recapitalization). If the Seller is selling vested shares of Stock under the Issuer's restricted stock plan in order to pay applicable withholding taxes, the Seller has arranged for a representative of the Issuer to notify a representative designated by SB of the number of shares of Stock necessary to be sold in order to satisfy the Seller's tax obligation. The proceeds of such sale shall be remitted by SB to the Issuer (net of SB's commissions and applicable transaction fees). SB will not be responsible for the calculation of such taxes or payment of such taxes to the applicable governmental tax authority. 8.) For purposes of this Plan, a "business day" means any day on which SB is open for business.
B.) Issuer Representation Certificate The Seller acknowledges that as a condition precedent to SB's acceptance of this Plan, SB must receive acknowledgment from an authorized representative of the Issuer that the Issuer is aware that Seller intends to enter into a Rule 10b5-1 plan with SB in the form previously supplied to the Issuer and that entering into such a Plan does not violate the Issuer's insider trading policy. C.) Sale Period, Modification and Termination 1.) No Sale Period (as defined in Schedules A-1 and A-2) may commence until two (2) business days after the Adoption Date. No Sale Period may be extended pursuant to the terms of Schedules A-1 and A-2 without: the Issuer's written representation that such extension does not violate the Issuer's trading policy. 2.) This Plan may not be modified unless: (i) the Seller provides SB with five (5) business days prior written notice and (ii) the Seller and SB agree to such modification in writing. Any such modification will contain the Seller's representation that as of the effective date of the modification, he or she is not aware of any material non-public information regarding the Issuer or any of its securities (including the Stock). 3.) This Plan will terminate on whichever of the following events occurs first: a.) if the Seller is a natural person, the date upon which SB receives notice of the Seller's death, b.) the date specified in Schedules A-1 and A-2 on which all sales under this Plan will cease, c.) any sale effected pursuant to this Plan that violates (or in the opinion of counsel to the Issuer or SB is likely to violate) any applicable Federal or State law or regulation or that fails to comply (or in the opinion of counsel to the Issuer or SB is likely not to comply) with Rules 144, 145 or 701 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"), d.) the Seller fails to comply in any material respect with its obligations under this Plan, e.) Issuer and/or the Seller enter into a contract that prevents or materially restricts sales of Stock by the Seller under this Plan, f.) two (2) business days after the date on which SB receives written notice that the Seller has terminated this Plan (which may be for any reason), g.) two (2) business days after SB notifies the Seller in writing that SB has terminated this Plan (which may be for any reason), h.) two (2) business days after the date on which SB receives notice that the Seller has filed a petition for bankruptcy or the adjustment of the Seller's debts, or a petition for bankruptcy has been filed against the Seller and has not been dismissed within thirty (30) calendar days of its filing, and i.) as to sales resulting from an Option exercise, the date on which SB receives written notice from the Issuer that the Options specified in Schedules A-1 have expired or been terminated or forfeited. D.) Representations and Warranties The Seller makes the following representations. The representation in Subsection (a) is made on the Adoption Date. The remaining representations are made on the Adoption Date and are deemed to be re-stated during the Term.
a.) He/she is not aware on the Adoption Date of any material nonpublic information with respect to the Issuer or any of its securities (including the Stock); b.) he/she is not subject to any legal, regulatory, or contractual restriction or undertaking that would prevent SB from conducting sales throughout the Term in accordance with Schedule A-1 and A-2 ; c.) he/she is entering into this Plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b5-1; d.) the Stock and Options subject to this Plan are not subject to any liens, security interests or other impediments to transfer (except for limitations imposed by Rules 144, 145 or 701, if the Seller is subject to these rules), nor is there any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding pending, or to the Seller's knowledge threatened, that would prevent or interfere with the exercise of Options or sale of Stock under this Plan; e.) he/she has not entered into or altered a corresponding or hedging transaction or put option equivalent with respect to the Stock, and agrees not to enter into any such transaction while this Plan is in effect; and f.) he/she does not have authority, influence or control over any sales of Stock effected by SB pursuant to this Plan, and will not attempt to exercise any authority, influence or control over such sales. E.) Rules 144, 145 and 701 (Check the applicable box or boxes) X For purposes of Rule 144, the Seller is an "affiliate" of the Issuer or intends to sell shares of Stock under this Plan that are "restricted securities." [ ] The Seller acquired the Stock in a transaction covered by Rule 145. [ ] The Seller acquired the Stock under Rule 701 and intends to sell the Stock in accordance with Rule 701(g)(3). [ ] Neither Rule 144, 145, nor 701 is applicable to the Seller under this Plan. If the Seller is an "affiliate" of the Issuer, acquired the Stock under a Rule 145 transaction, or holds "restricted shares" which are not otherwise registered for resale under the 1933 Act, then all sales under this Plan will be made by SB in accordance with Rule 144 or Rule 145(d), as applicable. SB will conduct sales under Rule 701(g)(3) if the third box is checked (unless the Seller is an affiliate). The Seller agrees not to take, and agrees to cause any person or entity with whom the Seller would be required to aggregate sales of Stock under Rule 144 not to take, any action that would cause any such sale not to comply with Rule 144. SB will be responsible for filing each required Form 144. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that SB will make only one Form 144 filing each three-month period commencing with the first scheduled sale of Stock under this Plan. SB shall deliver to Seller and the issuer, as soon as reasonably practicable, all information necessary (to the extent that SB possesses such
information) for the Seller and/or the issuer to make all required Form 4 and 5 filings, as required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with regard to sales made pursuant to the Plan. The Seller agrees to advise SB promptly of any sale of Stock by the Seller (or any other person or entity whose sales of Stock would be aggregated with those of the Seller for purposes of compliance with the volume limitations of Rule 144) that is not covered by this Plan, except that the Seller may sell Stock outside of this Plan only if and to the extent that no such sale affects the amount of Stock that may be sold under this Plan in compliance with the volume limitations of Rule 144. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that: (i) sales under this Plan shall not be in any way affected by any sales outside of this Plan, and (ii) for purposes of this sentence, the term "Seller" shall mean and include the Seller and any other person or entity whose sales of Stock would be aggregated with those of the Seller for purposes of compliance with the volume limitations of Rule144. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that he/she will provide SB with a signed and completed Form 144 no later than five business days prior to the commencement of any Sale Period set forth on Schedule A-1 and A-2. F.) Exchange Act Filings The Seller agrees to make all filings required by the Exchange Act in connection with this Plan. SB will not be required to: (i) make any of these filings on the Seller's behalf, (ii) review any Exchange Act filing made by the Seller, or (iii) determine whether any Exchange Act filing by the Seller has been made on a timely basis. SB will not be liable to the Seller for any misstatement, omission or defect in any of these filings. G.) Indemnification and Limitation of Liability; No Advice 1.) The Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless SB (and its directors, officers, employees and affiliates) from and against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or attributable to: a.) any material breach by the Seller of its obligations under this Plan, b.) the incorrectness or inaccuracy of any of the Seller's representations and warranties (including the representation required by Section (C)(2) of this Plan), c.) any violation by the Seller of applicable laws or regulations relating to this Plan or the transactions contemplated by this Plan; and d.) any exercise of Options under Schedule A-2 if cash is not available to pay the exercise price of such Options. This indemnification will survive the termination of this Plan. The Seller will have no indemnification obligation in the case of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of SB or any other indemnified person. 2.) Regardless of any other term or condition of this Plan, SB will not be liable to the Seller for: (a) special, indirect, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages, or incidental losses or damages of any kind, including but not limited to lost profits, lost savings, loss of use of facility or equipment, regardless of whether arising from breach of contract, warranty, tort, strict liability or otherwise, and even if
advised of the possibility of such losses or damages or if such losses or damages could have been reasonably foreseen, or (b) any failure to perform or for any delay in performance that results from a cause or circumstance that is beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to failure of electronic or mechanical equipment, strikes, failure of common carrier or utility systems, severe weather, market disruptions or other causes commonly known as "acts of God". In addition, SB will not be liable to the Seller in the event sales of Stock made in accordance with the terms of this Plan violate the Issuer's insider trading policies. 3.) The Seller acknowledges that SB has not provided the Seller with any tax, accounting or legal advice with respect to this Plan, including whether the Seller would be entitled to any of the affirmative defenses under Rule 10b5-1. H.) Governing Law This Plan will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without regard to such State's conflict of laws rules. I.) Entire Agreement This Plan (including all Schedules) reflects the entire agreement between the parties concerning the sale of Stock under Rule 10b5-1, and supersedes any previous or contemporaneous agreements or promises concerning these sales, whether written or oral. In the event of a conflict between the terms and conditions of this Plan and the terms and conditions of: (i) any other agreement between the Seller and SB concerning sales of Stock under Rule 10b5-1, or (ii) any written instructions provided by the Issuer to the Seller concerning this Plan or Rule 10b5-1 plans in general, the terms and conditions of this Plan will govern. J.) Assignment This Plan and each party's rights and obligations under this Plan may not be assigned or delegated without the written permission of the other party and will be for the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise. K.) Enforceability in the Event of Bankruptcy The Seller and SB acknowledge and agree that this Plan is a "securities contract," as such term is defined in Section 741(7) of Title 11 of the United States Code ("Bankruptcy Code"), entitled to all of the protections given such contracts under the Bankruptcy Code.
L.) Confidentiality SB will maintain the confidentiality of this Plan and will not disclose the specific terms of this Plan to any person or entity, except: (i) to employees, affiliates and agents of SB who have a legitimate business need to know such information, (ii) to any governmental agency having jurisdiction over SB or any self-regulatory organization of which it is a member, or (iii) to any other person or entity to the extent such disclosure is required by law or by a subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. M.) Method of Communication Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Plan, any communications required or permitted hereunder may be in writing or made orally, provided that any communications made orally must be confirmed in writing within one business day of such communication.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99 Press release of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. dated September 20, 2004.

EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES RAISES SALES, EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FIRST QUARTER AND FISCAL 2005 CLEVELAND, OHIO, September 20, 2004 - After posting record earnings for its last quarter and 2004 year, Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today raised sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal 2005 first quarter, ending Sept. 30, as well as for the fiscal year as a whole. First quarter sales are now expected to total $409 to $413 million, an increase of approximately 13 to 14 percent over the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The company's previous guidance, issued on August 6, estimated first quarter sales would be up by 9 to 11 percent. Earnings expectations for the 2005 first quarter are raised to a range of $0.60 to $0.70 per share. Previous guidance estimated first quarter earnings at $0.40 to $0.50 per share. Current guidance includes expected non-recurring gains of $0.05 per share which were not in the earlier forecast. For all of fiscal 2005, Applied is now projecting earnings of $2.15 to $2.35 per share on sales between $1.63 billion and $1.66 billion. Previous guidance was earnings of $1.80 to $2.00 per share on sales between $1.57 billion and $1.61 billion. "In our initial first quarter forecast, we anticipated a strong sales improvement," said Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh. "The actual sales trend accelerated through July and August beyond our expectations. Thus far, September sales appear more in line with our original forecast. "For the remainder of the year, we expect to see year-over-year sales increases that will moderate compared to our first quarter, but will still provide for healthy earnings increases. For our second quarter ending December 31, we expect to see growth between 7 to 9 percent from the prior year. Overall sales in our second quarter will be lower than our first quarter due to three fewer selling days. We also expect a somewhat higher level of expense. For our third and fourth quarters, we foresee sales growth of only 5 to 8 percent versus year-ago quarters due to tougher comparisons," he said.

EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS EARNINGS RISE 170% TO RECORD LEVELS IN FISCAL 2005 FIRST QUARTER CLEVELAND, Ohio, October 19, 2004 - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported its sales increased 14% and net income rose by 170% in the fiscal 2005 first quarter, ended September 30. This represents the company's highest ever quarterly earnings and continues a string of eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year EPS growth of over 25%. Quarterly results are consistent with the company's sales and earnings guidance, which was revised upward on September 20, 2004. Net sales for the first quarter increased to $413,126,000 from $361,146,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased to $13,040,000 or $0.65 per share compared to $4,832,000 or $0.25 per share last year. Commenting on the performance, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "We were extremely pleased by our first quarter performance. The rebound of the industrial economy created strong demand for our products and services as industrial plants ran at an increasing rate of utilization. This strong demand coupled with our improved business strategies and more efficient operations, helped us drive our operating margin to 5.2%, more than 100% higher than last year's first quarter. "The fundamentals in our business remain very healthy. While somewhat higher, our inventories are consistent with expected future customer demand. Receivables are well-controlled. Long-term debt remains low. "At this point, we expect that fiscal 2005 second quarter sales will rise between 8 and 12% compared to the same quarter last year, with earnings per share in the range of $0.42 and $0.52 compared to $0.26 in the second quarter last year. The second quarter of fiscal 2005 contains three fewer sales days than the first quarter just ended. For fiscal 2005 as a whole, we reiterate our previous guidance of earnings in a range of $2.15 to $2.35 per share on sales of between $1.63 billion and $1.66 billion." During the first quarter of 2005, the company purchased 203,000 shares of its common stock for $6.0 million. At September 30, 2004, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 667,000 additional shares.

EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REAFFIRMS SALES, EARNINGS GUIDANCE FOR FISCAL 2005 SECOND QUARTER CLEVELAND, Dec. 28, 2004 - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reiterated that earnings for its fiscal 2005 second quarter, ending Dec. 31, 2004, are expected within the guidance originally provided by the company, most likely around the middle of the range of $0.28 to $0.35 per share. In addition, the company reaffirmed its previously provided guidance for full-year fiscal 2005 earnings of $1.43 to $1.57 per share. (Note: all per-share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 stock split paid on Dec. 17, 2004.) Sales for the second quarter are expected to be at the high end of previous guidance, which called for an increase of 8 to 12% over the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Applied is scheduled to report second quarter results on Jan. 14, 2005. An investor conference call will be conducted at 11 a.m. on Jan. 14. Applied Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "Sales activity has continued strong across North America throughout the second quarter, maintaining the momentum generated over the past three quarters. "Importantly, the operating fundamentals of our business remain well-managed and will allow us to continue good earnings conversion this quarter even in the face of increasing inflationary challenges. Our expected second quarter earnings per share would represent an increase of more than 75% over the comparable period last year. This would be the ninth consecutive quarter in which our per-share earnings have increased by 25% or more. "As anticipated, our gross margins are being squeezed by pricing push-back from customers in an environment of multiple price increases from many of our product suppliers. "Our second quarter results will also be negatively affected by currency fluctuations associated with the fall in the value of the U.S. dollar, which particularly impacts the value of our Canadian cross-currency swaps." With more than 430 facilities and 4,300 employee associates across North America, Applied Industrial Technologies offers more than 2 million parts critical to the operations of MRO and OEM customers in virtually every industry. In addition, Applied provides engineering, design and systems integration for industrial and fluid power applications, as
well as customized mechanical, fabricated rubber and fluid power shop services. For its fiscal year ended June 30, 2004, the Company posted sales of $1.52 billion. Applied can be visited on the Internet at http://www.applied.com . This press release contains statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "will," "expect," "guidance" and similar expressions. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by Applied or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved.

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS 94% INCREASE IN SECOND QUARTER EPS, REVISES FULL YEAR GUIDANCE UPWARD CLEVELAND, OHIO (JANUARY 14, 2005) - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported record earnings for its second quarter and first half ended December 31, 2004. Applied's net income and earnings per share rose by 94 percent on a sales increase of 12.4 percent for its fiscal 2005 second quarter. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter in which Applied's per-share earnings have increased by 25 percent or more. Net sales for the quarter were $404,139,000 compared with $359,711,000 in the same period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased to $9,980,000 from $5,133,000. Earnings per share increased to $0.33 from $0.17 per share last year and was consistent with Applied's previous guidance. (Note: all per-share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a 3-for-2 stock split paid December 17, 2004.) For the six months ended December 31, 2004, sales increased 13.4 percent to $817,265,000 from $720,857,000 in the same period last year. Net income increased 131 percent to $23,020,000, or $0.76 per share, versus $9,965,000, or $0.34 per share, last year. Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "We were once again pleased with the strength of our quarterly results, and with our ability to convert sales increases to proportionately higher levels of profitability. This was a direct result of the continued focus on our core strategies of profitable sales growth, cost containment and asset management. "Sales continued strong across all geographic regions, product technologies and customer industries. Productivity improvements served as an offset to margin pressures created by inflation in vendor prices, as well as a shift in our product and customer mix. "Selling, distribution and administrative expenses for the second quarter stayed essentially flat compared to last year, even with a sales increase of more than 12 percent. We continued to actively manage our expenses with special attention paid to discretionary spending, helping to raise our operating margin to 4.3 percent this quarter, compared with 2.6 percent in the same period last year. "At this point, we believe our fiscal 2005 third quarter sales will be in the range of $430 to $440 million, with earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.41. Sales for all of fiscal 2005 are expected in the range of between $1.68 billion and $1.70 billion. Based on our stronger
sales forecast, we are raising our EPS guidance for the full fiscal year and now expect to earn $1.55 to $1.62 per share compared to our previous guidance of $1.43 to $1.57." Through the first six months of fiscal 2005, the company purchased 357,000 shares of its common stock for $7.2 million. At December 31, 2004, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 1,001,000 additional shares.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 10 Form of Non-Statutory Stock Option Award Terms and Conditions (Directors)

EXHIBIT 10 NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS (DIRECTORS) Your Non-Statutory Stock Option Award (the "Award") is made by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Applied"). 1. GRANT OF OPTION; EXERCISABILITY. The Award is governed by Applied's 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan"), including the policies adopted by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") under the Plan, and these terms and conditions. Applied grants you an option to purchase the stated number of shares (the "Shares") of Applied's common stock, without par value, at the stated price, subject to the following conditions: (a) Your option rights are exercisable, in whole or in part, from the option's date of grant (the "Grant Date") until the option expiration date. (b) Your option rights expire at the end of the 10-year period commencing with the Grant Date (the "Term"), or upon such earlier expiration or termination date as may be provided by Section 2 below, and the option rights shall not be exercisable thereafter. 2. TERMINATION OF OPTION. If, during the Term, you cease to be a director of Applied for any reason, you may exercise your option rights at any time within one year after your cessation as a director (but only during the Term). Notwithstanding anything in these terms and conditions, the Committee may terminate the option if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. The Committee's determination shall be effective at the time of your act. 3. METHOD OF EXERCISE. During your life, your option rights may be exercised only by you, your guardian, or legal representative. Upon your death, your option rights may be exercised by the person so entitled by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Your option may be exercised by delivering to Applied at its principal executive offices (directed to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Secretary) a written notice (which may include facsimile transmission or electronic mail), signed by you or such other person entitled to exercise the option, of the election to exercise the option and stating the number of Shares then being purchased. The option shall be deemed exercised as of the date Applied receives the notice. The notice must be accompanied, as an essential part thereof, by the payment of the full purchase price of the Shares then being purchased. If the option is exercised, as provided herein, by any person other than you, the notice shall be accompanied by appropriate evidence of that person's right to exercise the option. Payment of the full purchase price may be made in (a) cash or by certified or official bank check, (b) shares of Applied's Common Stock ("Stock"), accompanied by appropriate stock powers, or (c) any combination thereof. Stock used in payment of the purchase price shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on the exercise date. As a condition to your valid exercise of option rights, you must take such actions (if any), including the
payment of cash and/or Stock, as Applied deems necessary pursuant to federal, state or local tax laws, including withholding requirements. Promptly following the option's proper exercise, Applied shall issue in the name of the person exercising the option, and deliver to that person, a certificate or certificates for the Shares purchased. As an option holder, you shall have no rights as a shareholder in respect of any of the Shares as to which the option shall not have been effectively exercised. Also, you shall have no rights as a shareholder in respect of any Shares as to which the option shall have been duly exercised until and unless Applied has issued a certificate or certificates for the Shares. 4. LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE. This option shall not be exercisable if the exercise would violate: (a) Any state securities law; (b) Any registration or other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any stock exchange's listing requirements; or (c) Any other legal requirement of any governmental authority. If your exercise of the option is prevented by the terms of any of the foregoing subsections, and the option terminates pursuant to Section 2, then you may, within 30 days after Applied notifies you that your exercise is no longer prevented by this Section 4, exercise the option to the extent it would have been exercisable but for the operation of this Section 4. Furthermore, if a registration statement with respect to the Shares to be issued upon this option's exercise is not in effect or if Applied's counsel deems it necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible violation of the Act, Applied may require, as a condition to its issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares, the delivery to Applied of a commitment in writing by the person exercising the option that (i) at the time of the exercise it is his intention to acquire the Shares for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof; (ii) the person understands that the Shares may be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 issued under the Act; and (iii) any resale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares will be accomplished only in compliance with Rule 144, the Act, or other or subsequent rules and regulations thereunder. Applied may place on the certificates a legend reflecting that commitment and Applied may refuse to permit transfer of the certificates until it has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it that no violation of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would be involved in the transfer. 5. NONASSIGNABILITY. This option and the option rights granted are not assignable or transferable and may not be otherwise disposed of by you other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION, MERGER, SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS. If (a) Applied is to be merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity so that Applied is not the surviving corporation and, immediately after such event, the holders of Stock immediately prior to the event hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity, (b) Applied is to be dissolved or liquidated, or (c)
substantially all of Applied's assets are to be sold, then the Committee shall give you 30 days' prior written notice. Upon the giving of that notice, the Company may elect to cancel the option and to pay you the greater of (x) the difference (if positive) between the option purchase price and Fair Market Value and (y) the difference (if positive) between the option purchase price and the aggregate consideration that you would have received for the Shares in the transaction described in clause (a), (b) or (c) above had the option been exercised by you in whole immediately prior to consummation of such transaction. 7. ADJUSTMENTS. In the event (a) of a stock dividend or stock split or (b) the Stock is changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the Shares purchasable hereunder, and/or the option exercise price, shall be equitably adjusted so that the option represents the right to purchase that number of Shares or the number and kind of other securities that the Shares would have represented had the option been fully exercised immediately preceding such event. In the event of other changes or events relating to the Stock that fundamentally change the value of the Shares or securities for which the option is exercisable, then the Committee shall make such adjustments in the number or kind of shares of Stock or other securities covered by the option and in the number or kind of shares of Stock or other securities purchasable at the option exercise price, and/or such adjustments in the option exercise price, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine is equitably required by the change or event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, you shall not be entitled to purchase a fraction of a share under this option. 8. COMMITTEE AUTHORITY. The Committee shall have authority, subject to the Plan's express provisions, to construe these terms and conditions and the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the Committee's judgment necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or these terms and conditions in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under this Section's provisions shall be conclusive for all purposes. 9. RELATIONSHIP TO THE PLAN. In the event of any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and the Plan or the Committee's policies, the Plan or the policies shall govern. Terms not otherwise defined in these terms and conditions have the meaning ascribed them in the Plan. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, these terms and conditions and the option granted shall be subject to all of the Plan's provisions in effect from time to time, which are incorporated herein by reference.

EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS RECORD SALES AND EARNINGS IN ITS THIRD QUARTER, RAISES GUIDANCE FOR FOURTH QUARTER CLEVELAND, OH (April 21, 2005) - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported that sales and operating income for its fiscal 2005 third quarter, which ended March 31, 2005, were the highest ever recorded by the company in any quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $446,470,000, up 14.2% compared with $391,053,000 in the same period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 54% to $16,336,000 from $10,611,000 last year. Earnings per share increased by 47% to $0.53 from $0.36 per share in the third quarter of 2004, marking the tenth consecutive quarter in which the company's earnings per share were at least 25% higher than the prior-year period. (Note: all per-share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 stock split paid December 17, 2004.) Third quarter 2005 earnings include an unforecasted gain of approximately $2.7 million or $0.09 per share, from proceeds on a life insurance policy and from the sale of stock received as a distribution from a customer's bankruptcy reorganization. Earnings for the same quarter last year included one-time gains of approximately $1.6 million, or $0.05 per share, from a tax settlement. For the nine months ended March 31, 2005, sales increased 13.7% to $1,263,735,000 from $1,111,910,000 in the same period last year. Net income for the period increased 91% to $39,356,000, or $1.29 per share, versus $20,576,000, or $0.70 per share, last year. Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "While the marketplace remains very competitive, our third quarter performance showed marked improvement fueled by a strong industrial economy. Every facet of our business performed well. Increased sales volume and ongoing improvements in our operating efficiencies enabled us to post a strong earnings increase -- even before the non-operating gain of $0.09 per share. We also achieved a return on assets of 13.4% through our first nine months as compared to 7.1% in the same period last year. "Significantly, we generated a third quarter operating margin of 5.4%, up from 3.8% in the same quarter a year ago. Through nine months, we have achieved an operating margin of 5%, a major milestone that we have worked hard to attain, even while our gross margin was lower than last year. We are sharing our improved financial performance with our shareholders and have raised our dividends 50% in the last year.
"Consistent with the productivity Applied has shown and with an anticipated continuation of a strong market, we are increasing sales and earnings guidance for our fiscal fourth quarter. Currently, we expect sales in the range of $450 million to $460 million, resulting in full-year sales of between $1.71 billion and $1.72 billion. Fourth quarter earnings per share are expected in the range of $0.45 to $0.50, resulting in full-year earnings of $1.74 to $1.79 per share." In the nine months ended March 31, 2005, the company repurchased 414,000 shares of stock for $8.9 million. At March 31, board authorization was in place to repurchase up to 1,001,000 additional shares. Applied will host its third quarter conference call at 4 p.m. today (Thursday, April 21). To join in the call, dial 1-800-311-0799 and passcode 6104983. The call will be conducted by Chairman and CEO David L. Pugh, President and COO Bill L. Purser, and CFO Mark O. Eisele.

Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "expect," "guidance" and similar expressions. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by Applied or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Cost of sales for interim financial statements is computed using estimated gross profit percentages which are adjusted throughout the year based upon available information. Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based on periodic physical inventories and the effect of year-end inventory quantities on LIFO costs. (2) Other (income) expense, net for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 includes a non-recurring gain of $2,500 related to the proceeds from a life insurance policy and a gain of $200 on the sale of stock received from a customer bankruptcy reorganization process. (3) All share and per share data have been restated to reflect a 3 for 2 stock split effective December 17, 2004. (4) During the quarter ended March 31, 2004, the Company recorded non-recurring tax benefits primarily from the settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to audits of our 1997 and 1998 tax returns and the acceptance by the IRS of tax refund claims for 1999, 2000, and 2001. The settlement added $1,600, or $0.05 per share, to earnings. (5) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to be consistent with presentation in the current year.

SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 10 Form of Non-Statutory Stock Option Award Terms and Conditions (Directors)

EXHIBIT 10 NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS (DIRECTORS) Your Non-Statutory Stock Option Award (the "Award") is made by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Applied"). 1. GRANT OF OPTION; EXERCISABILITY. The Award is governed by Applied's 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan"), including the policies adopted by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") under the Plan, and these terms and conditions. Applied grants you an option to purchase the stated number of shares (the "Shares") of Applied's common stock, without par value, at the stated price, subject to the following conditions: (a) Your option rights are exercisable, in whole or in part, from the option's date of grant (the "Grant Date") until the option expiration date. (b) Your option rights expire at the end of the 10-year period commencing with the Grant Date (the "Term"), or upon such earlier expiration or termination date as may be provided by Section 2 below, and the option rights shall not be exercisable thereafter. 2. TERMINATION OF OPTION. If, during the Term, you cease to be a director of Applied for any reason, you may exercise your option rights at any time within three years after your cessation as a director (but only during the Term). Notwithstanding anything in these terms and conditions, the Committee may terminate the option if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. The Committee's determination shall be effective at the time of your act. 3. METHOD OF EXERCISE. During your life, your option rights may be exercised only by you, your guardian, or legal representative. Upon your death, your option rights may be exercised by the person so entitled by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Your option may be exercised by delivering to Applied at its principal executive offices (directed to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Secretary) a written notice (which may include facsimile transmission or electronic mail), signed by you or such other person entitled to exercise the option, of the election to exercise the option and stating the number of Shares then being purchased. The option shall be deemed exercised as of the date Applied receives the notice. The notice must be accompanied, as an essential part thereof, by the payment of the full purchase price of the Shares then being purchased. If the option is exercised, as provided herein, by any person other than you, the notice shall be accompanied by appropriate evidence of that person's right to exercise the option. Payment of the full purchase price may be made in (a) cash or by certified or official bank check, (b) shares of Applied's Common Stock ("Stock"), accompanied by appropriate stock powers, or (c) any combination thereof. Stock used in payment of the purchase price shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on the exercise date. As a condition to your valid exercise of option rights, you must take such actions (if any), including the payment of cash and/or Stock, as Applied deems necessary pursuant to federal, state or local tax
laws, including withholding requirements. Promptly following the option's proper exercise, Applied shall issue in the name of the person exercising the option, and deliver to that person, a certificate or certificates for the Shares purchased. As an option holder, you shall have no rights as a shareholder in respect of any of the Shares as to which the option shall not have been effectively exercised. Also, you shall have no rights as a shareholder in respect of any Shares as to which the option shall have been duly exercised until and unless Applied has issued a certificate or certificates for the Shares. 4. LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE. This option shall not be exercisable if the exercise would violate: (a) Any state securities law; (b) Any registration or other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any stock exchange's listing requirements; or (c) Any other legal requirement of any governmental authority. If your exercise of the option is prevented by the terms of any of the foregoing subsections, and the option terminates pursuant to Section 2, then you may, within 30 days after Applied notifies you that your exercise is no longer prevented by this Section 4, exercise the option to the extent it would have been exercisable but for the operation of this Section 4. Furthermore, if a registration statement with respect to the Shares to be issued upon this option's exercise is not in effect or if Applied's counsel deems it necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible violation of the Act, Applied may require, as a condition to its issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares, the delivery to Applied of a commitment in writing by the person exercising the option that (i) at the time of the exercise it is his intention to acquire the Shares for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof; (ii) the person understands that the Shares may be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 issued under the Act; and (iii) any resale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares will be accomplished only in compliance with Rule 144, the Act, or other or subsequent rules and regulations thereunder. Applied may place on the certificates a legend reflecting that commitment and Applied may refuse to permit transfer of the certificates until it has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it that no violation of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would be involved in the transfer. 5. NONASSIGNABILITY. This option and the option rights granted are not assignable or transferable and may not be otherwise disposed of by you other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION, MERGER, SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS. If (a) Applied is to be merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity so that Applied is not the surviving corporation and, immediately after such event, the holders of Stock immediately prior to the event hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity, (b) Applied is to be dissolved or liquidated, or (c) substantially all of Applied's assets are to be sold, then the Committee shall give you 30 days'
prior written notice. Upon the giving of that notice, the Company may elect to cancel the option and to pay you the greater of (x) the difference (if positive) between the option purchase price and Fair Market Value and (y) the difference (if positive) between the option purchase price and the aggregate consideration that you would have received for the Shares in the transaction described in clause (a), (b) or (c) above had the option been exercised by you in whole immediately prior to consummation of such transaction. 7. ADJUSTMENTS. In the event (a) of a stock dividend or stock split or (b) the Stock is changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the Shares purchasable hereunder, and/or the option exercise price, shall be equitably adjusted so that the option represents the right to purchase that number of Shares or the number and kind of other securities that the Shares would have represented had the option been fully exercised immediately preceding such event. In the event of other changes or events relating to the Stock that fundamentally change the value of the Shares or securities for which the option is exercisable, then the Committee shall make such adjustments in the number or kind of shares of Stock or other securities covered by the option and in the number or kind of shares of Stock or other securities purchasable at the option exercise price, and/or such adjustments in the option exercise price, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine is equitably required by the change or event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, you shall not be entitled to purchase a fraction of a share under this option. 8. COMMITTEE AUTHORITY. The Committee shall have authority, subject to the Plan's express provisions, to construe these terms and conditions and the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the Committee's judgment necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or these terms and conditions in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under this Section's provisions shall be conclusive for all purposes. 9. RELATIONSHIP TO THE PLAN. In the event of any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and the Plan or the Committee's policies, the Plan or the policies shall govern. Terms not otherwise defined in these terms and conditions have the meaning ascribed them in the Plan. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, these terms and conditions and the option granted shall be subject to all of the Plan's provisions in effect from time to time, which are incorporated herein by reference.

I acknowledge and agree that the Corporation's policies, and not Baird's, will dictate the recognized sale price of any Option Shares for calculating tax withholding, and may or may not coincide with the actual realized sales price. I understand and agree that Baird is not responsible or liable for any fluctuation in market value of any Option Shares between the exercise date and the Corporation's receipt of funds to pay for such Option Shares. 8. I understand and agree that I will be charged a brokers' commission and a transaction fee for each sale of Shares pursuant to this Plan. I will ensure that, without advance notice or request from Baird, my Baird account at all times contains Shares sufficient to cover the sale directions set forth above, as well as sufficient immediately available cash to pay Baird when due all brokerage commissions and transaction costs. If my account does not contain sufficient Shares and cash to timely satisfy such obligations, Baird is hereby authorized to cancel or not effect any scheduled sales of Shares and/or terminate this Plan. In addition to the brokerage commissions and transaction costs for the sale of any Option Shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, Baird may charge me; and, if so charged, I will pay Baird a margin interest fee for advancing funds for the option exercise and tax withholding payments described above in an amount equal to interest at the broker call rate (usually two (2) percent below Baird's announced margin rate) from the Trade Date until the certificates representing Option Shares are received at Baird. 9. The sale formula, if applicable, and/or Price Limit and Amount Limit as specified under this Plan, shall be appropriately adjusted in the event of a stock split or other recapitalization affecting the Shares, as directed by the Corporation. 10. I certify that the below Social Security number is correct and that I am not subject to back up withholding. 11. I have consulted with my own advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of, and have not relied upon Baird or any person affiliated with Baird in connection with, my adoption and implementation of this Plan. I acknowledge and agree that Baird is not acting as a fiduciary or any advisor to me. I will indemnify and hold harmless Baird for any losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees) incurred by, claims made or actions brought against, Baird arising out of the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Plan. 12. Baird may rely upon my representations and agreements expressed in this Plan in issuing funds out of my account for the exercise of stock options.
[additional representations deleted] I understand and agree that any dispute between me and Baird arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Plan or any transaction relating to this Plan shall be determined by arbitration, in accordance with, and pursuant to, the arbitration provisions of any applicable client account agreement with Baird. /s/ L.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT On June 3, 2005, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (the registrant) entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with certain financial institutions party thereto and KeyBank National Association, as Lead Arranger, Book Runner and Administrative Agent for itself and such other financial institutions, providing for a five-year $100,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement, which is scheduled to mature on June 2, 2010, replaces the registrant's prior $100,000,000 credit facility with KeyBank National Association and various financial institutions. The aggregate maximum principal amount of commitments under the Credit Agreement may be expanded upon the registrant's request, subject to certain conditions, to $125,000,000. Currently, $25,000,000 of the commitments under the Credit Agreement are reserved for direct borrowings by certain of the registrant's Canadian subsidiaries that have been designated as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains sublimits for swingline loans and letters of credit. All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, including the obligations of the Canadian borrowers, are guaranteed by certain of the registrant's U.S. subsidiaries. Additionally, the registrant has agreed to guarantee the obligations of the Canadian borrowers under the Credit Agreement. The Canadian borrowers are not guarantors of the registrant's obligations under the Credit Agreement. As of June 3, 2005, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the previous credit facility. The Credit Facility is available for working capital needs and general corporate purposes of the registrant including acquisitions. The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on the registrant's ability, and in certain instances, the registrant's subsidiaries' ability to incur liens, make acquisitions and investments, or sell or transfer assets and stock. Additionally, the registrant may not permit its leverage ratio to exceed 3.0 to 1.0 or its interest coverage ratio to exceed 3.0 to 1.0. Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest as follows: (a) loans to the registrant will bear interest, at the registrant's election, at one of the following rates: (1) the base rate, which is the greater of (a) the effective prime rate announced by KeyBank National Association from time to time, or (b) a rate per annum that is 0.5% in excess of the effective federal funds rate; (2) the Eurodollar rate plus a margin of 0.30% to 0.55% per annum (based on the registrant's leverage ratio); or (3) with respect to swingline loans, the Administrative Agent's cost of funds plus a margin of 0.30% to 0.55% per annum (based on the registrant's leverage ratio); and (B) loans to the Canadian borrowers will bear interest, at the registrant's election, at either (1) the effective prime rate announced by the Toronto branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. from time to time, or (2) the average of certain quoted Canadian interbank bid rates for Canadian dollar bankers' acceptances plus a margin of 0.30% to 0.55% per annum (based on the registrant's leverage ratio). The Credit Agreement also provides for facility fees of 0.10% to 0.20% per annum (based on the registrant's leverage ratio).
Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the registrant's obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the Credit Agreement, covenant defaults, certain ERISA defaults, change of control and other customary defaults. The lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have engaged and may engage in commercial and investment banking transactions with the registrant in the ordinary course of business, and also provide or have provided advisory and financial services to the registrant. The Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4 to this Form.

(b) Each US Lender, for itself and not one for any other, agrees to make US Revolving Loans, make or participate in Swing Loans, and issue or participate in Letters of Credit, during the Commitment Period, on such basis that, immediately after the completion of any borrowing by US Borrower or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of US Revolving Loans made by such US Lender, when combined with such US Lender's pro rata share of the Letter of Credit Exposure and the Swing Line Exposure, shall not be in excess of the Maximum Amount for such US Lender, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of US Revolving Loans made by such US Lender shall represent that percentage of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding on all US Revolving Loans that shall be such US Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage. Each borrowing (other than Swing Loans) from the US Lenders hereunder shall be made pro rata according to the respective Applicable Commitment Percentages of the US Lenders. (c) Each Canadian Lender, for itself and not one for any other, agrees to make CAD Revolving Loans, during the Commitment Period, on such basis that, immediately after the completion of any borrowing by Canadian Borrowers, (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of CAD Revolving Loans made by such Canadian Lender shall not 22
be in excess of the Maximum Amount for such Canadian Lender, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CAD Revolving Loans made by such Canadian Lender shall represent that percentage of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding on all CAD Revolving Loans that shall be such Canadian Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage. Each borrowing from the Canadian Lenders hereunder shall be made pro rata according to the respective Applicable Commitment Percentages of the Canadian Lenders. (d) The Loans may be made as US Revolving Loans as described in Section 2.2(a) hereof, CAD Revolving Loans as described in Section 2.3 hereof and Swing Loans as described in Section 2.2(c) hereof, and Letters of Credit may be issued in accordance with Section 2.2(b) hereof.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Commitment Period, the US Lenders shall make a US Revolving Loan or US Revolving Loans to US Borrower in such amount or amounts as US Borrower may from time to time request, but not exceeding in aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding hereunder the Maximum US Revolving Amount, when such US Revolving Loans are combined with the Letter of Credit Exposure and the Swing Line Exposure. US Borrower shall have the option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to borrow US Revolving Loans, maturing on the last day of the Commitment Period, by means of any combination of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, US Borrower shall be entitled under this Section 2.2(a) to borrow funds, repay the same in whole or in part and re-borrow hereunder at any time and from time to time during the Commitment Period. (b) Letters of Credit. (i) Generally. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Commitment Period, the Fronting Lender shall, in its own name, on behalf of the US Lenders, issue such Letters of Credit for the account of US Borrower or a Domestic Guarantor of Payment, as US Borrower may from time to time request. US Borrower shall not request any Letter of Credit (and the Fronting Lender shall not be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit) if, after giving effect thereto, (A) the Letter of Credit Exposure would exceed the Letter of Credit Commitment or (B) the US Revolving Exposure would exceed the Maximum US Revolving Amount. The issuance of each Letter of Credit shall confer upon each US Lender the benefits and liabilities of a participation consisting of an undivided pro rata interest in the Letter of Credit to the extent of such US Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage. (ii) Request for Letter of Credit. Each request for a Letter of Credit shall be delivered to Agent (and to the Fronting Lender, if the Fronting Lender is a Lender other than Agent) by an Authorized Officer not later than 11:00 A.M. (Eastern time) three Business Days prior to the day upon which the Letter of Credit is to be issued. Each such request shall be in a form acceptable to Agent (and the Fronting Lender, if the Fronting Lender is a Lender other than Agent) and specify the face amount thereof, whether such 23
Letter of Credit shall be a commercial documentary or standby Letter of Credit, the account party, the beneficiary, the intended date of issuance, the expiry date thereof, and the nature of the transaction to be supported thereby. Concurrently with each such request, US Borrower, and any other Credit Party for whose account the Letter of Credit is to be issued, shall execute and deliver to the Fronting Lender an appropriate application and agreement, being in the standard form of the Fronting Lender for such letters of credit, as amended to conform to the provisions of this Agreement if required by Agent. Agent shall give the Fronting Lender and each US Lender notice of each such request for a Letter of Credit. (iii) Commercial Documentary Letters of Credit. With respect to each Letter of Credit that shall be a commercial documentary letter of credit and the drafts thereunder, whether issued for the account of US Borrower or any other Credit Party, US Borrower agrees to (A) pay to Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the US Lenders, a non-refundable commission based upon the face amount of such Letter of Credit, which shall be paid quarterly in arrears, on each Regularly Scheduled Payment Date, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans (in effect on the date such payment is to be made) times the face amount of such Letter of Credit; (B) pay to Agent, for the sole benefit of the Fronting Lender, an additional Letter of Credit fee, which shall be paid on the date that any draw shall be made on such Letter of Credit, at the rate of one-eighth percent (1/8%) of the amount drawn under such Letter of Credit; and (C) pay to Agent, for the sole benefit of the Fronting Lender, such other issuance, amendment, negotiation, draw, acceptance, telex, courier, postage and similar transactional fees as are generally charged by the Fronting Lender under its fee schedule as in effect from time to time. (iv) Standby Letters of Credit. With respect to each Letter of Credit that shall be a standby letter of credit and the drafts thereunder, if any, whether issued for the account of US Borrower or any other Credit Party, US Borrower agrees to (A) pay to Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the US Lenders, a non-refundable commission based upon the face amount of such Letter of Credit, which shall be paid quarterly in arrears, on each Regularly Scheduled Payment Date, at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans (in effect on the date such payment is to be made) times the undrawn face amount of such Letter of Credit; (B) pay to Agent, for the sole benefit of the Fronting Lender, an additional Letter of Credit fee, which shall be paid on each date that such Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended or renewed at the rate of one-eighth percent (1/8%) of the face amount of such Letter of Credit; and (C) pay to Agent, for the sole benefit of the Fronting Lender, such other issuance, amendment, negotiation, draw, acceptance, telex, courier, postage and similar transactional fees as are generally charged by the Fronting Lender under its fee schedule as in effect from time to time. (v) Refunding of Letters of Credit with Revolving Loans. Whenever a Letter of Credit shall be drawn, US Borrower shall immediately reimburse the Fronting Lender for the amount drawn. In the event that the amount drawn shall not have been reimbursed by US Borrower within one Business Day of the drawing of such Letter of Credit, at the sole option of Agent (and the Fronting Lender, if the Fronting Lender is a 24
Lender other than Agent), US Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a US Revolving Loan, subject to the provisions of Sections 2.2(a) and 2.6 hereof (other than the requirement set forth in Section 2.6(d) hereof), in the amount drawn. Such US Revolving Loan shall be evidenced by the US Revolving Credit Notes (or, if a US Lender has not requested a US Revolving Credit Note, by the records of Agent and such US Lender). Each US Lender agrees to make a US Revolving Loan on the date of such notice, subject to no conditions precedent whatsoever. Each US Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to make a US Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof when required by this subsection (v) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and that its payment to Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lender, of the proceeds of such US Revolving Loan shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such US Lender's US Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. US Borrower irrevocably authorizes and instructs Agent to apply the proceeds of any borrowing pursuant to this subsection (v) to reimburse, in full, the Fronting Lender for the amount drawn on such Letter of Credit. Each such US Revolving Loan shall be deemed to be a Base Rate Loan unless otherwise requested by and available to US Borrower hereunder. Each US Lender is hereby authorized to record on its records relating to its US Revolving Credit Note (or, if such US Lender has not requested a US Revolving Credit Note, its records relating to US Revolving Loans) such US Lender's pro rata share of the amounts paid and not reimbursed on the Letters of Credit. (vi) Participation in Letters of Credit. If, for any reason, Agent (or the Fronting Lender if the Fronting Lender shall be a Lender other than Agent) shall be unable to or, in the opinion of Agent, it shall be impracticable to, convert any Letter of Credit to a US Revolving Loan pursuant to the preceding subsection (v), Agent (or the Fronting Lender if the Fronting Lender is a Lender other than Agent) shall have the right to request that each US Lender purchase a participation in the amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit, and Agent shall promptly notify each US Lender thereof (by facsimile or telephone, confirmed in writing). Upon such notice, but without further action, the Fronting Lender hereby agrees to grant to each US Lender, and each US Lender hereby agrees to acquire from the Fronting Lender, an undivided participation interest in the amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to such US Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage of the principal amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each US Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to Agent, for the account of the Fronting Lender, such US Lender's ratable share of the amount due with respect to such Letter of Credit (determined in accordance with such US Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage). Each US Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in the amount due under any Letter of Credit that is drawn but not reimbursed by US Borrower pursuant to this subsection (vi) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and that each such payment 25
shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such US Lender's US Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. Each US Lender shall comply with its obligation under this subsection (vi) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.6 hereof with respect to US Revolving Loans. Each US Lender is hereby authorized to record on its records such US Lender's pro rata share of the amounts paid and not reimbursed on the Letters of Credit. In addition, each US Lender agrees to risk participate in the Existing Letters of Credit as provided in subsection (vii) below. (vii) Existing Letters of Credit. Schedule 2.2 hereto contains a description of all letters of credit outstanding on, and to continue in effect after, the Closing Date. Each such letter of credit issued by a bank that is or becomes a US Lender under this Agreement on the Closing Date (each, an "Existing Letter of Credit") shall constitute a "Letter of Credit" for all purposes of this Agreement, issued, for purposes of subsection (vi) above, on the Closing Date. US Borrower, Agent and the US Lenders hereby agree that, from and after such date, the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the Existing Letters of Credit, superseding any other agreement theretofore applicable to them to the extent inconsistent with the terms hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any reimbursement or other agreement applicable to the Existing Letters of Credit, the fees payable in connection with each Existing Letter of Credit to be shared with the US Lenders, or paid to the Fronting Lender for its own account, shall accrue from the Closing Date at the rate provided in this Section 2.2(b). (c) Swing Loans. (i) Generally. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Commitment Period, the Swing Line Lender shall make a Swing Loan or Swing Loans to US Borrower in such amount or amounts as US Borrower, through an Authorized Officer, may from time to time request; provided that US Borrower shall not request any Swing Loan if, after giving effect thereto, (A) the US Revolving Exposure would exceed the Maximum US Revolving Amount, or (B) the Swing Line Exposure would exceed the Swing Line Commitment. Each Swing Loan shall be due and payable on the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto. US Borrower shall not request that more than two Swing Loans be outstanding at any time. Each Swing Loan shall be made in Dollars. (ii) Refunding of Swing Loans. If the Swing Line Lender so elects, by giving notice to US Borrower and the US Lenders, US Borrower agrees that the Swing Line Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require that any Swing Loan be refinanced as a US Revolving Loan. Such US Revolving Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan unless otherwise requested by and available to US Borrower hereunder. Upon receipt of such notice by US Borrower and the US Lenders, US Borrower shall be deemed, on such day, to have requested a US Revolving Loan in the principal amount of the Swing Loan in accordance with Sections 2.2(a) and 2.6 hereof (other than the requirement set forth in Section 2.6(d) hereof). Each US Lender agrees to make a US Revolving Loan on the date 26
of such notice, subject to no conditions precedent whatsoever. Such US Revolving Loan shall be evidenced by the US Revolving Credit Notes (or, if a US Lender has not requested a US Revolving Credit Note, by the records of Agent and such US Lender). Each US Lender acknowledges and agrees that such US Lender's obligation to make a US Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof when required by this subsection (ii) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and that its payment to Agent, for the account of the Swing Line Lender, of the proceeds of such US Revolving Loan shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such US Lender's US Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. US Borrower irrevocably authorizes and instructs Agent to apply the proceeds of any borrowing pursuant to this subsection (ii) to repay in full such Swing Loan. (iii) Participation in Swing Loans. If, for any reason, Agent is unable to or, in the opinion of Agent, it is impracticable to, convert any Swing Loan to a US Revolving Loan pursuant to the preceding subsection (ii), then on any day that a Swing Loan is outstanding (whether before or after the maturity thereof), Agent shall have the right to request that each US Lender purchase a participation in such Swing Loan, and Agent shall promptly notify each US Lender thereof (by facsimile or telephone, confirmed in writing). Upon such notice, but without further action, the Swing Line Lender hereby agrees to grant to each US Lender, and each US Lender hereby agrees to acquire from the Swing Line Lender, an undivided participation interest in such Swing Loan in an amount equal to such US Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage of the principal amount of such Swing Loan. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each US Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to Agent, for the benefit of the Swing Line Lender, such US Lender's ratable share of such Swing Loan (determined in accordance with such US Lender's Applicable Commitment Percentage). Each US Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swing Loans pursuant to this subsection (iii) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not such US Lender's US Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. Each US Lender shall comply with its obligation under this subsection (iii) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.6 hereof with respect to US Revolving Loans to be made by such US Lender. Section 2.3. CAD Revolving Loans.

Canadian Borrowers shall have the option, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to borrow CAD 27
Revolving Loans, maturing no later than the last day of the Commitment Period, by means of any combination of CAD Base Rate Loans or CAD Fixed Rate Loans. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Canadian Borrowers shall be entitled under this Section 2.3 to borrow funds, repay the same in whole or in part and re-borrow hereunder at any time and from time to time during the Commitment Period. Section 2.4. Interest. (a) US Revolving Loans. (i) Base Rate Loan. US Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of a Base Rate Loan outstanding from time to time from the date thereof until paid at the Base Rate from time to time in effect. Interest on such Base Rate Loan shall be payable, commencing June 30, 2005, and on each Regularly Scheduled Payment Date thereafter and at the maturity thereof. (ii) Eurodollar Loans. US Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan outstanding from time to time, fixed in advance on the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto through the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (but subject to changes in the Applicable Margin), at the Derived Eurodollar Rate. Interest on such Eurodollar Loan shall be payable on each Interest Adjustment Date with respect to an Interest Period (provided that if an Interest Period shall exceed three months, the interest must be paid every three months, commencing three months from the beginning of such Interest Period). (b) Swing Loans. US Borrower shall pay interest to Agent, for the sole benefit of the Swing Line Lender (and any US Lender that shall have purchased a participation in such Swing Loan), on the unpaid principal amount of each Swing Loan outstanding from time to time from the date thereof until paid at the Derived Swing Loan Rate applicable to such Swing Loan. Interest on each Swing Loan shall be payable on the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto. Each Swing Loan shall bear interest for a minimum of one day. (c) CAD Revolving Loans. (i) CAD Base Rate Loan. Canadian Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of a CAD Base Rate Loan outstanding from time to time from the date thereof until paid at the CAD Base Rate from time to time in effect. Interest on such CAD Base Rate Loan shall be payable, commencing June 30, 2005, and on each Regularly Scheduled Payment Date thereafter and at the maturity thereof. (ii) CAD Fixed Rate Loans. Canadian Borrowers shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each CAD Fixed Rate Loan outstanding from time to time, fixed in advance on the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto through the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (but subject to changes in the Applicable Margin), at the Derived CAD Fixed Rate. Interest on such CAD Fixed Rate Loan shall be payable on each Interest Adjustment Date with respect to an Interest Period (provided 28
that if an Interest Period shall exceed ninety (90) days, the interest must be paid every ninety (90) days, commencing ninety (90) days from the beginning of such Interest Period). (d) Default Rate. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if an Event of Default shall occur, upon the election of the Required Lenders, (i) the principal of each Loan and the unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest, until paid, at the Default Rate, (ii) the fee for the aggregate undrawn face amount of all issued and outstanding Letters of Credit shall be increased by two percent (2%) in excess of the rate otherwise applicable thereto, and (iii) in the case of any other amount then due and owing from Borrowers hereunder or under any other Loan Document, such amount shall bear interest at the Default Rate until paid; provided that, during an Event of Default under Section 7.11 hereof, the applicable Default Rate shall apply without any election or action on the part of Agent or any Lender. (e) Limitation on Interest. (i) General. In no event shall the rate of interest hereunder exceed the maximum rate allowable by law. (ii) Canadian Interest. If any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document would obligate any Canadian Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to (including for the account of) any Canadian Lender in an amount, or calculated at a rate, that would be prohibited by law or would result in a receipt by such Canadian Lender of interest at a criminal rate (as such terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)) then, notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law or so result in a receipt by such Canadian Lender of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected, to the extent necessary, as follows: (A) first, by reducing the amount or rate of interest required to be paid to such Canadian Lender under this Article II; and (B) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other amounts required to be paid to such Canadian Lender that would constitute interest for purposes of Section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated thereby, if a Canadian Lender shall have received an amount in excess of the maximum amount permitted by that section of the Criminal Code (Canada), then Canadian Borrowers shall be entitled, by notice in writing to such Canadian Lender, to obtain reimbursement from such Canadian Lender in an amount equal to such excess, and pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount payable by such Canadian Lender to Canadian Borrowers. Any amount or rate of interest referred to in this Article II with respect to the Canadian Commitment shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest over the term that the Canadian Commitment remains outstanding on the assumption that any charges, fees or expenses that fall within the meaning of "interest" (as defined in the Criminal Code (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be pro-rated over that period of time and otherwise be pro-rated over the Commitment Period and, in the event of a 29
dispute, a certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by Agent shall be conclusive for the purposes of such determination. Section 2.5. Evidence of Indebtedness. (a) US Revolving Loans. Upon the request of a US Lender, to evidence the obligation of US Borrower to repay the Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans made by such US Lender and to pay interest thereon, US Borrower shall execute a US Revolving Credit Note in the form of the attached Exhibit A, payable to the order of such US Lender in the principal amount of its US Revolving Credit Commitment or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of US Revolving Loans made by such US Lender; provided, however, that failure of a US Lender to request a Revolving Credit Note shall in no way detract from US Borrower's obligations to such US Lender hereunder. (b) Swing Loan. The obligation of US Borrower to repay the Swing Loans and to pay interest thereon shall be evidenced by a Swing Line Note of US Borrower in the form of the attached Exhibit B, and payable to the order of the Swing Line Lender in the principal amount of the Swing Line Commitment, or, if less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Swing Loans made by the Swing Line Lender.

US Borrower may at any time and from time to time permanently reduce in whole or ratably in part the US Commitment of the US Lenders hereunder to an amount not less than the then existing US Revolving Credit Exposure, by giving Agent not fewer than three Business Days notice of such reduction, provided that any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount, for all of the US Lenders, of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), increased by increments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). Agent shall promptly notify each US Lender of the date of each such reduction and such US Lender's proportionate share thereof. After each such reduction, the facility fees payable hereunder shall be calculated upon the Maximum US Revolving Amount as so reduced. (ii) Canadian Commitment. Canadian Borrowers may at any time and from time to time permanently reduce in whole or ratably in part the Canadian Commitment of the Canadian Lenders hereunder to an amount not less than the then existing CAD Revolving Exposure, by giving Agent not fewer than three Business Days notice of such reduction, provided that any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount, for all of the Canadian Lenders, of not less than Five Million Canadian Dollars (CAD 34
5,000,000), increased by increments of One Million Canadian Dollars (CAD 1,000,000). Agent shall promptly notify each Canadian Lender of the date of each such reduction and such Canadian Lender's proportionate share thereof. After each such reduction, the facility fees payable hereunder shall be calculated upon the Maximum CAD Revolving Amount as so reduced. (iii) Generally. If Borrowers reduce in whole the Commitment of the Lenders, on the effective date of such reduction (the appropriate Borrowers having prepaid in full the unpaid principal balance, if any, of the Loans, together with all interest and facility and other fees accrued and unpaid, and provided that no Letter of Credit Exposure or Swing Line Exposure shall exist), all of the Notes, if Notes have been issued, shall be delivered to Agent marked "Canceled" and Agent shall redeliver such Notes to Borrowers. Any partial reduction in the Total Commitment Amount shall be effective during the remainder of the Commitment Period. The US Commitment may not, at any time, be reduced to an amount less than the then existing amount of the Canadian Commitment. (b) Increase in Commitment. At any time during the Commitment Increase Period, US Borrower may increase the Total Commitment Amount from the Closing Commitment Amount up to the Maximum Commitment Amount (with a corresponding increase in the Maximum US Revolving Amount) by either (i) increasing, for one or more US Lenders, with their prior written consent (and with the prior written consent of Agent), their respective US Revolving Credit Commitments, or (ii) including one or more Additional Lenders, with the prior written consent of Agent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), each with a new US Revolving Credit Commitment, as a party to this Agreement (collectively, the "Additional Commitment"). During the Commitment Increase Period, the Lenders agree that Agent, in its sole discretion, may permit one or more Additional Commitments upon satisfaction of the following requirements: (A) each Additional Lender, if any, shall execute an Additional Lender Assumption Agreement, (B) Agent shall provide to each Lender a revised Schedule 1 to this Agreement, including revised Applicable Commitment Percentages for each of the Lenders, if appropriate, at least three Business Days prior to the date of the effectiveness of such Additional Commitments (each an "Additional Lender Assumption Effective Date"), (C) each Additional Lender's US Revolving Credit Commitment shall be for an amount of no less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), and (D) US Borrower shall execute and deliver to Agent and the US Lenders such replacement or additional US Revolving Credit Notes as shall be required by Agent (to the extent Notes have been requested by the affected Lenders). The Lenders hereby authorize Agent to execute each Additional Lender Assumption Agreement on behalf of the Lenders. On each Additional Lender Assumption Effective Date, the US Lenders shall make adjustments among themselves with respect to the US Revolving Loans then outstanding and amounts of principal, interest and facility fees and other amounts paid or payable with respect thereto as shall be necessary, in the opinion of Agent, in order to reallocate among such US Lenders such outstanding amounts, based on the revised Applicable Commitment Percentages and to otherwise carry out fully the intent and terms of this Section 2.10(b). In connection therewith, it is understood and agreed that the Maximum Amount of any Lender will not be increased (or decreased except pursuant to Section 2.10(a) hereof) without the prior written consent of such Lender. US Borrower shall not increase the Total Commitment Amount pursuant to this Section 35
2.10(b) if a Default or an Event of Default shall then exist, or immediately after giving effect to any such increase would exist. Section 2.11. Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Generally. With the exception of Base Rate Loans, CAD Base Rate Loans and CAD Fixed Rate Loans, interest on Loans and facility and other fees and charges hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year having three hundred sixty (360) days and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed. With respect to Base Rate Loans, CAD Base Rate Loans and CAD Fixed Rate Loans, interest shall be computed on the basis of a year having three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed. (b) Interest Act (Canada). For purposes of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the annual rates of interest or fees to which the rates of interest or fees provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and stated herein and therein, as applicable, to be computed on the basis of a year having three hundred sixty (360) days, three hundred sixty-five (365) days or any other period of time less than a calendar year) are equivalent to the rates so determined when multiplied by the actual number of days in the applicable calendar year and divided by three hundred sixty (360), three hundred sixty-five (365) days or such other period of time, respectively. Section 2.12. Mandatory Payment. (a) US Revolving Credit Commitment. If, at any time, the US Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed the Maximum US Revolving Amount as then in effect, US Borrower shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the US Revolving Loans sufficient to bring the US Revolving Credit Exposure within the Maximum US Revolving Amount. (b) Swing Line Commitment. If, at any time, the Swing Line Exposure shall exceed the Swing Line Commitment, US Borrower shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the Swing Loans sufficient to bring the Swing Line Exposure within the Swing Line Commitment. (c) CAD Revolving Credit Commitment. If, at any time, the CAD Revolving Exposure shall exceed the Maximum CAD Revolving Amount as then in effect, Canadian Borrowers shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the CAD Revolving Loans sufficient to bring the CAD Revolving Exposure within the Maximum CAD Revolving Amount. (d) Total Commitment Amount. If, at any time, the Revolving Credit Exposure shall exceed the Total Commitment Amount as then in effect, Borrowers shall, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the next Business Day, prepay an aggregate principal amount of the Loans sufficient to bring the Revolving Credit Exposure within the Total Commitment Amount. 36
(e) Generally. Unless otherwise designated by Borrowers, each prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be applied in the following order (i) first, on a pro rata basis among all of the outstanding Base Rate Loans or CAD Base Rate Loans, as applicable, and (ii) second, on a pro rata basis among all of the outstanding Eurodollar Loans and CAD Fixed Rate Loans, as applicable, provided that, if the outstanding principal amount of any Eurodollar Loan or CAD Fixed Rate Loan shall be reduced to an amount less than the minimum amount set forth in Section 2.6 hereof as a result of such prepayment, then such Eurodollar Loan or CAD Fixed Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan or CAD Base Rate Loan, as appropriate, on the date of such prepayment. Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan, Swing Loan or CAD Fixed Rate Loan pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be subject to the prepayment provisions set forth in Article III hereof. Section 2.13. Canadian Borrowers. (a) Joint and Several Liability of Canadian Borrowers. Each request by a Canadian Borrower for the making, conversion or continuation of a CAD Revolving Loan shall be deemed to be a joint and several request by all Canadian Borrowers. Each Canadian Borrower hereby authorizes any other Canadian Borrower to request that US Borrower submit a Notice of Loan for a CAD Revolving Loan on behalf of Canadian Borrowers. Each Canadian Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Agent and the Canadian Lenders are entering into this Agreement at the request of each Canadian Borrower and with the understanding that each Canadian Borrower is and shall remain fully liable, jointly and severally, for payment in full of the Applicable Debt; provided that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no Canadian Borrower will at any time be liable for the Indebtedness of US Borrower. Each Canadian Borrower agrees that it is receiving or will receive a direct pecuniary benefit for each CAD Revolving Loan made hereunder. (b) Maximum Liability of Each Canadian Borrower. Anything in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the maximum liability of any Canadian Borrower exceed the maximum amount that (after giving effect to the incurring of the obligations hereunder and to any rights to contribution of such Canadian Borrower from other Affiliates of such Canadian Borrower) would not render the rights to payment of Agent and the Canadian Lenders hereunder void, voidable or avoidable under any applicable fraudulent transfer law. (c) Appointment of US Borrower as Canadian Borrower's Agent. Each Canadian Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints US Borrower as the borrowing agent and attorney-in-fact for all Canadian Borrowers, which appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice signed by each Canadian Borrower that such appointment has been revoked. Each Canadian Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes US Borrower (i) to provide Agent with all notices with respect to CAD Revolving Loans obtained for the benefit of any Canadian Borrower and all other notices and instructions under this Agreement, and (ii) to take such action as US Borrower deems appropriate on its behalf to obtain CAD Revolving Loans and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. 37
Section 2.14. Waivers of Borrowers. In the event that any obligation of any Borrower under this Agreement is deemed to be an agreement by such Borrower to answer for the debt or default of another Credit Party, each Borrower represents and warrants that (a) no representation has been made to such Borrower as to the creditworthiness of such other Credit Party, and (b) such Borrower has established adequate means of obtaining from such other Credit Party on a continuing basis, financial or other information pertaining to such other Credit Party's financial condition. Each Borrower expressly waives, except as expressly required under this Agreement, diligence, demand, presentment, protest and notice of every kind and nature whatsoever, and consents that Agent, the Lenders and any other Credit Party may deal with each other in connection with such obligations or otherwise, or alter any contracts now or hereafter existing between them, in any manner whatsoever, including without limitation the renewal, extension, acceleration or changes in time for payment of any such obligations or in the terms or conditions of any security held. Agent and the Lenders are hereby expressly given the right, at their option, to proceed in the enforcement of any of the Obligations independently of any other remedy or security they may at any time hold in connection with such obligations secured and it shall not be necessary for Agent and the Lenders to proceed upon or against or exhaust any other security or remedy before proceeding to enforce their rights against such Borrower. Each Borrower further subordinates any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification, setoff or other recourse in respect of sums paid to Agent and the Lenders by any other Credit Party. Section 2.15. Extension of Commitment. Contemporaneously with the delivery of the financial statements required pursuant to Section 5.3(b) hereof (beginning with the financial statements for the fiscal year of US Borrower ending June 30, 2005), US Borrower may deliver a Request for Extension, requesting that the Lenders extend the maturity of the Commitment for an additional year. Each such extension shall require the unanimous written consent of all of the Lenders and shall be upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by Agent, Borrowers and the Lenders. US Borrower shall pay any reasonable and properly documented attorneys' fees or other expenses of Agent in connection with the documentation of any such extension, as well as such other fees as may be agreed upon between Borrowers and Agent. ARTICLE III. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO FIXED RATE LOANS; INCREASED CAPITAL; TAXES Section 3.1. Requirements of Law. (a) If, after the Closing Date, (i) the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or (ii) the compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority: (A) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit or any Fixed Rate Loan made by it, or change the 38
basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Taxes and Excluded Taxes which are governed by Section 3.2 hereof); (B) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar Rate or the CAD Fixed Rate; or (C) shall impose on such Lender any other condition; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining Fixed Rate Loans or issuing or participating in Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any such case, US Borrower (and any Canadian Borrower to which such Loan was made) shall pay to such Lender, promptly after receipt of a written request therefor, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection (a), such Lender shall promptly notify US Borrower (with a copy to Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled. (b) If any Lender shall have determined that, after the Closing Date, the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder, or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit, to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Lender or corporation with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon submission by such Lender to US Borrower (with a copy to Agent) of a written request therefor (which shall include the method for calculating such amount and reasonable detail with respect to the calculation), the appropriate Borrowers shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction. (c) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.1 together with a reasonably detailed calculation and description of such amounts contemplated by this Section 3.1, submitted by any Lender to US Borrower (with a copy to Agent) shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the amounts so payable. In determining any such additional amounts, such Lender may use any method of averaging and attribution that it (in its good faith, reasonable credit judgment) shall deem applicable. The obligations of Borrowers pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. 39
Section 3.2. Taxes. (a) All payments made by any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes or Other Taxes. If any Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in the Loan Documents. (b) In addition, the Credit Parties shall pay Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. (c) Whenever any Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be withheld and paid by a Credit Party, such Credit Party shall timely withhold and pay such taxes to the relevant Governmental Authorities. As promptly as possible thereafter, such Credit Party shall send to Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by such Credit Party showing payment thereof. If such Credit Party shall fail to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, such Credit Party shall indemnify Agent and the appropriate Lenders on demand for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by Agent or such Lender as a result of any such failure. (d) If any Lender shall be so indemnified by a Credit Party, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the benefits of any refund, deduction or credit for any taxes or other amounts with respect to the amount paid by such Credit Party and shall reimburse such Credit Party to the extent, but only to the extent, that such Lender shall receive a refund with respect to the amount paid by such Credit Party or an effective net reduction in taxes or other governmental charges (including any taxes imposed on or measured by the total net income of such Lender) of the United States or any state or subdivision or any other Governmental Authority thereof by virtue of any such deduction or credit, after first giving effect to all other deductions and credits otherwise available to such Lender. If, at the time any audit of such Lender's income tax return is completed, such Lender determines, based on such audit, that it shall not have been entitled to the full amount of any refund reimbursed to such Credit Party as aforesaid or that its net income taxes shall not have been reduced by a credit or deduction for the full amount reimbursed to such Credit Party as aforesaid, such Credit Party, upon request of such Lender, shall promptly pay to such Lender the amount so refunded to which such Lender shall not have been so entitled, or the amount by which the net income taxes of such Lender shall not have been so reduced, as the case may be. (e) Each Lender that is not (i) a citizen or resident of the United States of America, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America (or any jurisdiction thereof), or (iii) an estate or trust that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income (any such Person, a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver to US Borrower and Agent two copies of either U.S. Internal 40
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a statement with respect to such interest and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by Credit Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement or such other Loan Document. In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms or appropriate replacements promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify US Borrower at any time it determines that such Lender is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to US Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (e), a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this subsection (e) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver. (f) The agreements in this Section 3.2 shall survive the termination of the Loan Documents and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Section 3.3. Funding Losses. US Borrower, and any appropriate Canadian Borrower to the extent such activity involves a CAD Fixed Rate Loan made to such Canadian Borrower, agree to indemnify each Lender, promptly after receipt of a written request therefor, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any properly documented loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by a Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Fixed Rate Loans after such Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by a Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Fixed Rate Loans after such Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of a Fixed Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) the making of a prepayment of a Swing Loan on a day that is not the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto, or (e) any conversion of a Fixed Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan or CAD Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto. Such indemnification shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amounts so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) or the applicable Swing Loan Maturity Date in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the appropriate London interbank market (or Canadian market, if applicable), along with any administration fee charged by such Lender. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 submitted to US Borrower (with a copy to Agent) by any Lender, together with a reasonably detailed 41
calculation and description of such amounts shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence of the amounts so payable. The obligations of Borrowers pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder. Section 3.4. Eurodollar Rate or CAD Fixed Rate Lending Unlawful; Inability to Determine Rate. (a) If any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, upon notice thereof to US Borrower and Agent, be conclusive and binding on Borrowers) that, after the Closing Date, (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or (ii) any Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender to make or continue any Loan as, or to convert (if permitted pursuant to this Agreement) any Loan into, a Fixed Rate Loan, the obligations of such Lender to make, continue or convert any such Fixed Rate Loan shall, upon such determination, be suspended until such Lender shall notify Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and all outstanding Fixed Rate Loans payable to such Lender shall automatically convert (if conversion is permitted under this Agreement) into a Base Rate Loan or CAD Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, or be repaid (if no conversion is permitted) at the end of the then current Interest Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if required by law or such assertion. (b) If Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate or CAD Fixed Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Fixed Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate or CAD Fixed Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Fixed Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the applicable Lenders of funding such Loan, Agent will promptly so notify US Borrower and each applicable Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the applicable Lenders to make or maintain such Fixed Rate Loan shall be suspended until Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, US Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of such Fixed Rate Loan or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of a Base Rate Loan or CAD Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, in the amount specified therein.

The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents will not conflict with nor result in any breach in any of the provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Liens permitted under Section 5.9 hereof) upon any assets or property of any Company under the provisions of, such Company's Organizational Documents or any agreement.

No litigation or proceeding arising under, relating to or in connection with any Environmental Law is pending or, to the best knowledge of each Company, threatened, against any Company, any real property in which any Company holds or has held an interest or any past or present operation of any Company that is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No release, threatened release or disposal of hazardous waste, solid waste or other wastes is occurring, or has occurred (other than those that are currently being cleaned up in accordance with Environmental Laws), on, under or to any real property in which any Company holds any interest or performs any of its operations, in violation of any Environmental Law that is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Schedule 6.10 hereto identifies each ERISA Plan. No ERISA Event has occurred or is expected to occur with respect to an ERISA Plan. Full payment has been made of all amounts that a Controlled Group member is required, under applicable law or under the governing documents, to have paid as a contribution to or a benefit under each ERISA Plan. The liability of each Controlled Group member with respect to each ERISA Plan has been fully funded based upon reasonable and proper actuarial assumptions, has been fully insured, or has been fully reserved for on its financial statements. No changes have occurred or are expected to occur that would cause a material increase in the cost of providing benefits under the ERISA Plan. With respect to each ERISA Plan that is intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a), (a) the ERISA Plan and any associated trust operationally comply with the applicable requirements of Code Section 401(a); (b) the ERISA Plan and any associated trust have been amended to comply in all material respects with all such requirements as currently in effect, other than those requirements for which a retroactive amendment can be made within the "remedial amendment period" available under Code Section 401(b) (as extended under Treasury Regulations and other Treasury pronouncements upon which taxpayers may rely); (c) the ERISA Plan and any associated trust have received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating that the ERISA Plan qualifies under Code Section 401(a), that the associated trust qualifies under Code Section 501(a) and, if applicable, that any cash or deferred arrangement under the ERISA Plan qualifies under Code Section 401(k), unless the ERISA Plan was first adopted at a time for which the above-described "remedial amendment period" has not yet expired; (d) the ERISA Plan currently satisfies the requirements of Code Section 410(b), without regard to any retroactive amendment that may be made within the above-described "remedial amendment period"; and (e) no contribution made to the ERISA Plan is subject to an excise tax under Code Section 4972. With respect to any Pension Plan (other than with respect to the Detroit Ball Bearing Company Union Employees' Retirement Plan), the "accumulated benefit obligation" of Controlled Group members with respect to the Pension Plan (as determined in accordance with Statement of Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions") does not exceed the fair market value of Pension Plan assets. Section 6.11. Consents or Approvals. No consent, approval or authorization of, or filing, registration or qualification with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required to be obtained or completed by any Company in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of any of the Loan Documents, that has not already been obtained or completed.

US Borrower has received consideration that is the reasonable equivalent value of the obligations and liabilities that US Borrower has incurred to Agent and the Lenders. US Borrower is not insolvent as defined in any applicable state, federal or relevant foreign statute, nor will US Borrower be rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents to Agent and the Lenders. US Borrower is not engaged or about to engage in any business or transaction for which the assets retained by it are or will be an unreasonably 56
small amount of capital, taking into consideration the obligations to Agent and the Lenders incurred hereunder. US Borrower does not intend to, nor does it believe that it will, incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. (b) Canadian Borrowers.

Section 6.18. Accurate and Complete Statements.

Each Lender shall have the right at any time or times to assign to an Eligible Transferee (other than to a Lender that shall not be in compliance with this Agreement), without recourse, all or a percentage of all of the following: (i) such Lender's Commitment, (ii) all Loans made by that Lender, (iii) such Lender's Notes, and (iv) such Lender's interest in any Letter of Credit or Swing Loan, and any participation purchased pursuant to Section 2.2(b), 2.2(c) or 8.5 hereof. (b) Prior Consent. No assignment may be consummated pursuant to this Section 10.10 without the prior written consent of US Borrower and Agent (other than an assignment by any Lender to another Lender or to any affiliate of such Lender which affiliate is an Eligible Transferee and either wholly-owned by a Lender or is wholly-owned by a Person that wholly owns, either directly or indirectly, such Lender), which consent of US Borrower and Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld (a failure of US Borrower to approve a distressed debt fund or vulture fund shall not be deemed to be unreasonable so long as the Leverage Ratio for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters of US Borrower shall be less than 3.00 to 1.00); provided, however, that US Borrower's consent shall not be required if, at the time of the proposed 68
assignment, any Default or Event of Default shall then exist. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any Lender may at any time make a collateral assignment of all or any portion of its rights under the Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank, and no such assignment shall release such assigning Lender from its obligations hereunder. (c) Minimum Amount. Each such assignment shall be in a minimum amount of the lesser of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of the assignor's Commitment and interest herein, or the entire amount of the assignor's Commitment and interest herein. (d) Assignment Fee. Unless the assignment shall be to an affiliate of the assignor or the assignment shall be due to merger of the assignor or for regulatory purposes, either the assignor or the assignee shall remit to Agent, for its own account, an administrative fee of Three Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($3,500). (e) Assignment Agreement. Unless the assignment shall be due to merger of the assignor or a collateral assignment for regulatory purposes, the assignor shall (i) cause the assignee to execute and deliver to US Borrower and Agent an Assignment Agreement, and (ii) execute and deliver, or cause the assignee to execute and deliver, as the case may be, to Agent such additional amendments, assurances and other writings as Agent may reasonably require. (f) Non-U.S. Assignee. If the assignment is to be made to an assignee that is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any state thereof, the assignor Lender shall cause such assignee, at least five Business Days prior to the effective date of such assignment, (i) to represent to the assignor Lender (for the benefit of the assignor Lender, Agent and Borrowers) that under applicable law and treaties no taxes will be required to be withheld by Agent, Borrowers or the assignor with respect to any payments to be made to such assignee in respect of the Loans hereunder, (ii) to furnish to the assignor Lender (and, in the case of any assignee registered in the Register (as defined below), Agent and US Borrower) either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, as applicable (wherein such assignee claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments hereunder), and (iii) to agree (for the benefit of the assignor, Agent and Borrowers) to provide to the assignor Lender (and, in the case of any assignee registered in the Register, to Agent and US Borrower) a new Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN, as applicable, upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form and comparable statements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations and amendments duly executed and completed by such assignee, and to comply from time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard to such withholding tax exemption. Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, a Canadian Lender may not make any assignment to an Eligible Assignee that is a non-resident of Canada for purposes of the Income Tax Act of Canada (with respect to which payments to such non-resident of principal, interest, fees and other amounts by the Canadian Borrowers would be subject to Canadian withholding tax) at a rate higher than that then applicable to the assignor. (g) Deliveries by Borrowers. Upon satisfaction of all applicable requirements specified in subsections (a) through (f) above, Borrowers shall execute and deliver (i) to Agent, the assignor and the assignee, any consent or release (of all or a portion of the obligations of the 69
assignor) required to be delivered by Borrowers in connection with the Assignment Agreement, and (ii) to the assignee and the assignor, if applicable, an appropriate Note or Notes. After delivery of the new Note or Notes, the assignor's Note or Notes being replaced shall be returned to US Borrower marked "replaced". (h) Effect of Assignment. Upon satisfaction of all applicable requirements set forth in subsections (a) through (g) above, and any other condition contained in this Section 10.10, (i) the assignee shall become and thereafter be deemed to be a "Lender" for the purposes of this Agreement, (ii) the assignor shall be released from its obligations hereunder to the extent that its interest has been assigned, (iii) in the event that the assignor's entire interest has been assigned, the assignor shall cease to be and thereafter shall no longer be deemed to be a "Lender" and (iv) the signature pages hereto and Schedule 1 hereto shall be automatically amended, without further action, to reflect the result of any such assignment. (i) Agent to Maintain Register. Agent shall maintain at the address for notices referred to in Section 10.4 hereof a copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and Borrowers, Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. Section 10.11. Sale of Participations. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at any time sell participations to one or more commercial banks or other Persons other than a Company or an Affiliate of a Company (each a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights or obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a portion of the Commitment and the Loans and participations owing to it and the Note held by it); provided that: (a) any such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged; (b) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; (c) the parties hereto shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents; (d) such Participant shall be bound by the provisions of Section 8.5 hereof, and the Lender selling such participation shall obtain from such Participant a written confirmation of its agreement to be so bound; and 70
(e) no Participant (unless such Participant is itself a Lender) shall be entitled to require such Lender to take or refrain from taking action under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document, except that such Lender may agree with such Participant that such Lender will not, without such Participant's consent, take action of the type described as follows: (i) increase the portion of the participation amount of any Participant over the amount thereof then in effect, or extend the Commitment Period, without the written consent of each Participant affected thereby; or (ii) reduce the principal amount of or extend the time for any payment of principal of any Loan, or reduce the rate of interest or extend the time for payment of interest on any Loan, or reduce the commitment fee, without the written consent of each Participant affected thereby. Borrowers agree that any Lender that sells participations pursuant to this Section 10.11 shall still be entitled to the benefits of Article III hereof, notwithstanding any such transfer; provided, however, that the obligations of Borrowers shall not increase as a result of such transfer and Borrowers shall have no obligation to any Participant. Section 10.12. Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any other party) hereby notifies the Credit Parties that, pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, such Lender and Agent are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Credit Parties, which information includes the name and address of the Credit Parties and other information that will allow such Lender or Agent, as applicable, to identify the Credit Parties in accordance with the Patriot Act. US Borrower shall provide, to the extent commercially reasonable, such information and take such actions as are reasonably requested by Agent or a Lender in order to assist Agent or such Lender in maintaining compliance with the Patriot Act. Section 10.13. Severability of Provisions; Captions; Attachments. Any provision of this Agreement that shall be prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. The several captions to sections and subsections herein are inserted for convenience only and shall be ignored in interpreting the provisions of this Agreement. Each schedule or exhibit attached to this Agreement shall be incorporated herein and shall be deemed to be a part hereof. Section 10.14. Investment Purpose. Each of the Lenders represents and warrants to Borrowers that it is entering into this Agreement with the present intention of acquiring any Note issued pursuant hereto for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of distribution or resale, it being understood, however, that each Lender shall at all times retain full control over the disposition of its assets. Section 10.15. Confidentiality. Agent and each Lender shall hold all Confidential Information in accordance with the customary procedures of Agent or such Lender for handling 71
confidential information of this nature, and in accordance with safe and sound banking practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent or any Lender may in any event make disclosures of, and furnish copies of Confidential Information (a) to another agent under this Agreement or another Lender; (b) when reasonably required by any bona fide transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated transfer of any Loans or Commitment or participation therein (provided that each such prospective transferee or participant shall execute an agreement for the benefit of Borrowers with such prospective transferor Lender or participant containing provisions substantially identical to those contained in this Section 10.15); (c) to the parent corporation or other affiliates of Agent or such Lender, and to their respective auditors and attorneys; and (d) as required or requested by any governmental agency or representative thereof, or pursuant to legal process, provided, that, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law or court order, Agent or such Lender, as applicable, shall notify the chief financial officer of US Borrower of any request by any governmental agency or representative thereof (other than any such request in connection with an examination of the financial condition of Agent or such Lender by such governmental agency), and of any other request pursuant to legal process, for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such Confidential Information. In no event shall Agent or any Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by or on behalf of any Company. Each Borrower hereby agrees that the failure of Agent or any Lender to comply with the provisions of this Section 10.15 shall not relieve any Borrower of any of the obligations to Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Section 10.16. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, any Note and any other Loan Document or other agreement, document or instrument attached hereto or executed on or as of the Closing Date integrate all of the terms and conditions mentioned herein or incidental hereto and supersede all oral representations and negotiations and prior writings with respect to the subject matter hereof. Section 10.17. Legal Representation of Parties. The Loan Documents were negotiated by the parties with the benefit of legal representation and any rule of construction or interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement or any other Loan Document to be construed or interpreted against any party shall not apply to any construction or interpretation hereof or thereof. Section 10.18. Currency. (a) Currency Equivalent Generally. For the purposes of making valuations or computations under this Agreement (but not for the purposes of the preparation of any financial statements delivered pursuant hereto), unless expressly provided otherwise, where a reference is made to a dollar amount the amount is to be considered as the amount in Dollars and, therefor, each other currency shall be converted into the Dollar Equivalent. (b) Payment Currency. All payments by a Credit Party shall be made in the manner, at the place and in the currency (the "Payment Currency") required by the Loan Documents; provided, however, that, if the Payment Currency is other than Dollars, such Credit Party may, at its option (or, if for any reason whatsoever such Credit Party is unable to effect payments in the foregoing manner, such Credit Party shall be obligated to) pay to Agent, for the benefit of the 72
Lenders, the equivalent amount in Dollars computed at the selling rate of Agent or a selling rate chosen by Agent, most recently in effect on or prior to the date such payment was due. In any case in which a Credit Party makes or is obligated to make a payment in Dollars, such Credit Party shall hold Agent and the Lenders harmless from any loss incurred by Agent and the Lenders arising from any change in the value of Dollars in relation to the Payment Currency between the date such payment is due and the date Agent is actually able to apply such Payment Currency to such payment. Section 10.19. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement, each of the Notes and any Related Writing shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio and the respective rights and obligations of Borrowers, Agent, and the Lenders shall be governed by Ohio law, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Ohio state or federal court sitting in Cleveland, Ohio, over any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Obligations or any Related Writing, and each Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Ohio state or federal court. Each Borrower, on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue in any action or proceeding in any such court as well as any right it may now or hereafter have to remove such action or proceeding, once commenced, to another court on the grounds of FORUM NON CONVENIENS or otherwise. Each Borrower agrees that a final, nonappealable judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. [Remainder of page left intentionally blank] 73
Section 10.20. JURY TRIAL WAIVER. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH BORROWER, AGENT AND EACH LENDER WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE A JURY PARTICIPATE IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, AMONG BORROWERS, AGENT AND THE LENDERS, OR ANY THEREOF, ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH, RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED AMONG THEM IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY NOTE OR OTHER INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT EXECUTED OR DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED THERETO.

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS RECORD YEAR WITH 76% INCREASE IN EARNINGS CLEVELAND, OHIO, AUGUST 9, 2005 - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported record sales and earnings for its fiscal 2005 ended June 30. Fiscal 2005 sales increased by 13.2% to $1,717,055,000 from $1,517,004,000 in fiscal 2004. Net income rose 75.8% to $55,339,000 versus $31,471,000 in the previous year. Earnings per share increased 68.2% to $1.80 compared to $1.07 last year. Net sales for the fourth quarter increased by 11.9% to $453,320,000 from $405,094,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 46.7% to $15,983,000 compared to $10,895,000 last year. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 40.5% to $0.52 per share from $0.37 per share last year. This was the company's eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year EPS increases of 25 percent or more. (Note: all per-share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 stock split paid December 17, 2004.) Full-year 2005 earnings include a one-time non-operating gain (see footnote for details) of approximately $3.0 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to a non-operating gain of $1.6 million, or $0.05 per share, in fiscal 2004 from a tax settlement. Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "We are pleased with our fiscal 2005 results and the improvement we saw in our performance throughout the year. We were able to leverage excellent top-line growth into even larger increases in earnings. The economy remained strong and our management team continued to perform well in all fundamental areas of our business. "Assets remain under good control. Our cash flow from operations has approximately doubled to over $81 million in 2005. Our cash balances have us well-positioned to pursue strategic growth opportunities as they are identified. "Looking ahead, we expect earnings of $0.48 to $0.54 per share on sales of $442 million to $454 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. For fiscal 2006 as a whole, we expect earnings of $2.00 to $2.10 per share on sales of $1.84 billion to $1.87 billion. During 2005, the company purchased 607,000 shares of its common stock for $14.6 million. At June 30, 2005, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase more than 831,000 additional shares.

This press release contains statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "expect" and similar expressions. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Applied assumes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, or events, or otherwise.
APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME (Thousands, except per share data) - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Cost of sales for interim financial statements is computed using estimated gross profit percentages which are adjusted throughout the year based upon available information. Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based on periodic physical inventories and the effect of year-end inventory quantities on LIFO costs. Fourth quarter adjustments in 2005 and 2004 increased gross profit by $1,612 and $3,283, net income by $981 and $2,131 and net income per share by $0.03 and $0.07 respectively. While there were no LIFO layer liquidations for the year ended June 30, 2005, reductions in year-end inventories during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of these liquidations for the year ended June 30, 2004 increased gross profit by $672, net income by $420, and net income per share by $0.01. (2) Other (income) expense, net for the year ended June 30, 2005 includes a non-recurring gain of approximately $3,000 related to the proceeds from life insurance policies (3) All share and per share data have been restated to reflect a 3-for-2 stock split effective December 17, 2004. (4) During the year ended June 30, 2004, the Company recorded non-recurring tax benefits primarily from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to audits of our 1997 and 1998 tax returns and the acceptance by the IRS of tax refund claims for 1999, 2000, and 2001. The settlement added $1,600, or $0.05 per share, to earnings for the June 30, 2004 year end. (5) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to be consistent with the presentation in the current year.

EXHIBIT INDEX

EXHIBIT 99 APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES REPORTS 29% EARNINGS INCREASE ON 7.3% SALES GAIN IN FISCAL 2006 FIRST QUARTER, RAISES FISCAL YEAR GUIDANCE CLEVELAND, Ohio, October 12, 2005 - Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported record first quarter sales and earnings. For its fiscal 2006 first quarter, ended September 30, net income rose by 29.2 percent on a sales increase of 7.3 percent. Net sales for the first quarter increased to $443,205,000 from $413,126,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased to $16,850,000 or $0.54 per share compared to $13,040,000 or $0.43 per share last year. This represents the twelfth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases in earnings per share of 25 percent or more. Both sales and earnings per share for the quarter were within previously issued guidance. (Note: all per-share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the 3-for-2 stock split paid December 17, 2004.) Commenting on the performance, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "This was another solid quarter and we once again were very pleased with our results, which were achieved in spite of slower-paced economic conditions and temporary business disruptions caused by localized severe weather. Our margin initiatives have allowed us to gain excellent earnings leverage on a slowing rate of sales growth. We continue to execute the business fundamentals quite well. "At this point, we see fiscal 2006 second quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.43 to $0.49 on sales of $440 million to $450 million. For fiscal 2006 as a whole, we are raising our earnings guidance to a range of $2.05 to $2.15 per share on improved sales of between $1.85 billion and $1.89 billion - up from previous guidance of $2.00 to $2.10 per share." During the first quarter of 2006, the company purchased 295,900 shares of its common stock in open market transactions for $10.2 million. At September 30, 2005, the company had remaining authorization to repurchase more than 535,000 additional shares. At September 30, Applied acquired the assets of Spencer Industries, Inc., a regional fluid power distributor headquartered in Kent, Wash. Its trailing 12-month sales were approximately $49 million. Spencer will operate as a subsidiary of Applied under the name Spencer Fluid Power Inc. and its operating results will be included starting in the second quarter.

The Shares to be sold under this Plan are owned free and clear by me (subject, in the case of Option Shares, only to my compliance with the exercise provisions of the underlying stock options) and are not subject to any agreement granting any pledge, lien, mortgage, hypothecation, security interest, charge, option or encumbrance or any other limitation on disposition, other than those which may have been entered into between me and Baird or imposed by Rules 144 or 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). 6. I understand and agree that, if I am an affiliate or control person of the Corporation for purposes of Rule 144, or if the Shares subject to this Plan are restricted Shares subject to limitations under Rule 144 or eligible for resale under Rule 145, then all sales of Shares under this Plan will be in accordance with the applicable provisions of Rule 144 or 145. I agree not to take, and agree to cause any person or entity with which I would be required to aggregate sales of Shares pursuant to Rule 144 not to take, any action that would cause the sales under this Plan not to meet all applicable requirements of Rule 144. Shares that may be sold under this Plan in compliance with the volume limitations of Rule 144. I will promptly advise Baird of any sale of Shares by me (or any other person or entity whose sales would be aggregated with me for purposes of Rule 144) that is not covered by this Plan so that Baird may
properly reflect such sale in any future Form 144 filed in connection with transactions under this Plan. I have provided completed and signed Form 144s to Baird to allow sales under this Plan. 7. I understand and agree that the Corporation may instruct Baird to withhold funds for tax withholding purposes from the proceeds of the sale of any Option Shares, and to transmit those funds to the Corporation. The amount of tax withheld, if any, and transmitted to the Corporation will be determined solely by the Corporation, and Baird has no responsibility or liability for such determination. Baird will forward to the Corporation funds for the exercise price and tax withholding after each sale of Option Shares on each Trade Date, provided that the net proceeds of such sale are sufficient to cover the applicable exercise price and tax withholding. I acknowledge and agree that the Corporation's policies, and not Baird's, will dictate the recognized sale price of any Option Shares for calculating tax withholding, and may or may not coincide with the actual realized sales price. I understand and agree that Baird is not responsible or liable for any fluctuation in market value of any Option Shares between the exercise date and the Corporation's receipt of funds to pay for such Option Shares. 8. I understand and agree that I will be charged a brokers' commission and a transaction fee for each sale of Shares pursuant to this Plan. I will ensure that, without advance notice or request from Baird, my Baird account at all times contains Shares sufficient to cover the sale directions set forth above, as well as sufficient immediately available cash to pay Baird when due all brokerage commissions and transaction costs. If my account does not contain sufficient Shares and cash to timely satisfy such obligations, Baird is hereby authorized to cancel or not effect any scheduled sales of Shares and/or terminate this Plan. In addition to the brokerage commissions and transaction costs for the sale of any Option Shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, Baird may charge me; and, if so charged, I will pay Baird a margin interest fee for advancing funds for the option exercise and tax withholding payments described above in an amount equal to interest at the broker call rate (usually two (2) percent below Baird's announced margin rate) from the Trade Date until the certificates representing Option Shares are received at Baird. 9. The sale formula, if applicable, and/or Price Limit and Amount Limit as specified under this Plan, shall be appropriately adjusted in the event of a stock split or other recapitalization affecting the Shares, as directed by the Corporation. 10. I certify that the below Social Security number is correct and that I am not subject to back up withholding. 11. I have consulted with my own advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of, and have not relied upon Baird or any person affiliated with Baird in connection with, my adoption and implementation of this Plan. I acknowledge and agree that Baird is not acting as a fiduciary or an advisor to me. I will indemnify and hold harmless Baird for any losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney fees) incurred by, claims made or actions brought against, Baird arising out of the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Plan.
12. Baird may rely upon my representations and agreements expressed in this Plan in issuing funds out of my account for the exercise of stock options. [additional representations deleted] I understand and agree that any dispute between me and Baird arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Plan or any transaction relating to this Plan shall be determined by arbitration, in accordance with, and pursuant to, the arbitration provisions of my applicable client account agreement with Baird. /s/ L.

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 10 Form of Non-Statutory Stock Option Award Terms and Conditions (Directors)

Exhibit 10 [APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES LOGO] NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AWARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS (DIRECTORS) Your Non-Statutory Stock Option Award (the "Award") is made by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Applied"). 1. GRANT OF OPTION; EXERCISABILITY. The Award is governed by Applied's 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan"), including the policies adopted by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") under the Plan, and these terms and conditions. Applied grants you an option to purchase the stated number of shares (the "Shares") of Applied's common stock, without par value, at the stated price, subject to the following conditions: (a) Your option rights are exercisable, in whole or in part, from the option's date of grant (the "Grant Date") until the option expiration date. (b) Your option rights expire at the end of the 10-year period commencing with the Grant Date (the "Term"), or upon such earlier expiration or termination date as may be provided by Section 2 below, and the option rights shall not be exercisable thereafter. 2. TERMINATION OF OPTION. If, during the Term, you cease to be a director of Applied for any reason, you may (a) exercise your option rights with respect to options granted prior to April 20, 2005, no later than the later of: (i) the 15th day of the third month following the one-year anniversary date of your cessation as a director (but only during the Term), or (ii) the December 31st of the calendar year in which the one-year anniversary date of your cessation as a director occurs (but only during the Term), and (b) exercise your option rights with respect to options granted on and after April 20, 2005, at any time within 36 months after your cessation as a director (but only during the Term). Notwithstanding anything in these terms and conditions, the Committee may terminate the option if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. The Committee's determination shall be effective at the time of your act. 3. METHOD OF EXERCISE. During your life, your option rights may be exercised only by you, your guardian, or legal representative. Upon your death, your option rights may be exercised by the person so entitled by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Your option may be exercised by delivering to Applied at its principal executive offices (directed to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Secretary) a written notice (which may include facsimile transmission or electronic mail), signed by you or such other person entitled to exercise the option, of the election to exercise the option and stating the number of Shares then being purchased. The option shall be deemed exercised as of the date Applied receives the notice. The notice must be accompanied, as an essential part thereof, by the payment of the full purchase price of the Shares then being purchased. If the option is exercised, as provided herein, by any person other than you, the notice shall be accompanied by appropriate evidence of that person's right to exercise the option. Payment of the full purchase price may be made in (a) cash or by certified or official bank check, (b) shares of Applied's Common Stock ("Stock"), accompanied by appropriate stock powers, or (c) any combination
thereof. Stock used in payment of the purchase price shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on the exercise date. As a condition to your valid exercise of option rights, you must take such actions (if any), including the payment of cash and/or Stock, as Applied deems necessary pursuant to federal, state or local tax laws, including withholding requirements. Promptly following the option's proper exercise, Applied shall issue in the name of the person exercising the option, and deliver to that person, a certificate or certificates for the Shares purchased. As an option holder, you shall have no rights as a shareholder in respect of any of the Shares as to which the option shall not have been effectively exercised. Also, you shall have no rights as a shareholder in respect of any Shares as to which the option shall have been duly exercised until and unless Applied has issued a certificate or certificates for the Shares. 4. LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE. This option shall not be exercisable if the exercise would violate: (a) Any state securities law; (b) Any registration or other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any stock exchange's listing requirements; or (c) Any other legal requirement of any governmental authority. If your exercise of the option is prevented by the terms of any of the foregoing subsections, and the option terminates pursuant to Section 2, then you may, within 30 days after Applied notifies you that your exercise is no longer prevented by this Section 4, exercise the option to the extent it would have been exercisable but for the operation of this Section 4. Furthermore, if a registration statement with respect to the Shares to be issued upon this option's exercise is not in effect or if Applied's counsel deems it necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible violation of the Act, Applied may require, as a condition to its issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares, the delivery to Applied of a commitment in writing by the person exercising the option that (i) at the time of the exercise it is his intention to acquire the Shares for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof; (ii) the person understands that the Shares may be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 issued under the Act; and (iii) any resale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares will be accomplished only in compliance with Rule 144, the Act, or other or subsequent rules and regulations thereunder. Applied may place on the certificates a legend reflecting that commitment and Applied may refuse to permit transfer of the certificates until it has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it that no violation of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would be involved in the transfer. 5. NONASSIGNABILITY. This option and the option rights granted are not assignable or transferable and may not be otherwise disposed of by you other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 6. LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION, MERGER, SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS. If (a) Applied is to be merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity so that Applied is not the surviving corporation and, immediately after such event, the holders of Stock immediately prior to the event hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity, (b) Applied is to be dissolved or liquidated, or (c) substantially all of Applied's assets are to be sold, then the Committee shall give you 30 days' prior written notice. Upon the giving of that notice, the Company may elect to cancel the option and to pay you the greater of (x) the difference (if positive) between the option purchase price and Fair Market Value and (y) the difference (if positive)
between the option purchase price and the aggregate consideration that you would have received for the Shares in the transaction described in clause (a), (b) or (c) above had the option been exercised by you in whole immediately prior to consummation of such transaction. 7. ADJUSTMENTS. In the event (a) of a stock dividend or stock split or (b) the Stock is changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the Shares purchasable hereunder, and/or the option exercise price, shall be equitably adjusted so that the option represents the right to purchase that number of Shares or the number and kind of other securities that the Shares would have represented had the option been fully exercised immediately preceding such event. In the event of other changes or events relating to the Stock that fundamentally change the value of the Shares or securities for which the option is exercisable, then the Committee shall make such adjustments in the number or kind of shares of Stock or other securities covered by the option and in the number or kind of shares of Stock or other securities purchasable at the option exercise price, and/or such adjustments in the option exercise price, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine is equitably required by the change or event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, you shall not be entitled to purchase a fraction of a share under this option. 8. COMMITTEE AUTHORITY. The Committee shall have authority, subject to the Plan's express provisions, to construe these terms and conditions and the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the Committee's judgment necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or these terms and conditions in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under this Section's provisions shall be conclusive for all purposes. 9. RELATIONSHIP TO THE PLAN. In the event of any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and the Plan or the Committee's policies, the Plan or the policies shall govern. Terms not otherwise defined in these terms and conditions have the meaning ascribed them in the Plan. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, these terms and conditions and the option granted shall be subject to all of the Plan's provisions in effect from time to time, which are incorporated herein by reference. (November 2005)

Prior year earnings included a $0.09 per share boost from non-operating gains on insurance and bankruptcy settlements. For the nine month period ending March 31, 2006, sales increased 10.5% to $1.397 billion from $1.264 billion in the same period last year. Operating income for the nine months was up 35.5%. Earnings per share increased to $1.69 versus $1.29 last year. Commenting on the results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "Our performance is indicative of the focused efforts we are directing at all fundamentals of our business. Our balanced growth initiatives are taking advantage of a continuing strong market, and our cost control and margin improvement efforts have allowed us to leverage our sales gains into very good profit contribution. Our asset management is equally strong, resulting in an excellent balance sheet. "As a result of our strong operating performance and continued favorable outlook, we are raising our annual earnings guidance from a range of $2.10 to $2.20 per share, to a range of $2.29 to $2.34 per share on sales of $1.89 billion to $1.90 billion."

EXHIBIT 99
(May 2, 2006)  Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE-AIT) Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh announced today that the Company's Board of Directors has declared a three-for-two stock split payable on June 15, 2006 to shareholders of record on June 1, 2006. The company's stock had previously split three-for-two in December of 2004.
CLEVELAND, OHIO
"We are pleased to announce this split," said Pugh. "The trading volume in our stock has consistently increased over the last several years, and by making more shares available to the marketplace we expect that our liquidity will continue to improve. We believe the increased liquidity and the resulting share price of our stock following the split should make the stock more attractive to a broader audience of investors."
On June 15, an additional stock certificate will be issued representing one additional share of common stock for every two shares of common stock held. Stock certificates presently held continue to be valid and should be retained. Fractional shares will not be issued but will be paid in cash. Following the stock split, approximately 45 million shares of the company's stock will be outstanding. The Company's previously announced cash dividend of $0.18 will be paid on May 31, 2006, prior to the stock split.
With more than 440 facilities and 4,500 employee-associates across North America, Applied Industrial Technologies is an industrial distributor that offers more than 2 million parts critical to the operations of MRO and OEM customers in virtually every industry. In addition, Applied provides engineering, design and systems integration for industrial and fluid power applications, as well as customized mechanical, fabricated rubber and fluid power shop services.

ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS. David L. Pugh, Chairman and CEO of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied"), entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plan with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, dated May 8, 2006, pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b5-1. This rule permits individuals who are not then in possession of material nonpublic information to establish prearranged plans to buy or sell stock in the future, regardless of subsequent material nonpublic information. Under the plan, Mr. Pugh intends to sell up to 120,000 shares of Applied common stock from time to time between May 16 and September 29, subject to the market price of our stock.

The plan will facilitate the orderly sale of stock for personal financial planning purposes with the goals of minimizing market impact and avoiding concerns about the timing of the transactions. A copy of the plan is attached as Exhibit 99 to this Form. ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS. (c) Exhibits. --------- Exhibit No. 99 Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plan entered into as of May 8, 2006 between David L. Pugh and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized. APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (Registrant) By: /s/ Fred D. Bauer ----------------------------------- Fred D. Bauer Vice President-General Counsel & Secretary Date: May 9, 2006
EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ----------- 99 Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plan entered into as of May 8, 2006 between David L. Pugh and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated.

EXHIBIT 99 RULE 10B5-1 SALES PLAN, CLIENT REPRESENTATIONS, AND SALES INSTRUCTIONS I, David Pugh, as of the date below, establish this Sales Plan ("Plan") in order to sell shares of the common stock ("Shares") of the Issuer pursuant to the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"). I request that Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch") execute the Plan as follows: 1. SALES INSTRUCTIONS FOR SALES/EXERCISE AND SALE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS STARTING 05/16/2006 AND ENDING ON 9/29/2006, 1.1 For securities other than stock options, you are authorized to execute transactions in accordance with the attached SEC Rule 10b5-1 Sales Instruction and Notice Provision -Annex ("Sales Instruction") with respect to the security type "Shares". 1.2 For employee stock options, you are authorized to exercise my options and sell the underlying Shares in accordance with the Sales Instruction with respect to the security type "ESO". For purposes of this Section 1.2: 1. Merrill Lynch will not exercise any stock option unless its exercise price is less than the market price of the underlying Shares. 2. Merrill Lynch will deduct from the proceeds of each stock option exercised and the underlying Shares sold the sum of the exercise price and any withholding tax. The resulting amount will be then remitted to the Issuer. 3. Check which of the following apply: [ ] The Issuer of the Shares has executed a servicing agreement with Merrill Lynch for stock option services for the Issuer and its optionees. [X] The Issuer of the Shares has not executed a servicing agreement with Merrill Lynch for stock option services for the Issuer and its optionees and therefore I hereby agree to and authorize the following: In connection with the exercise of my employee stock options under the Plan I authorize and instruct the Issuer to register or cause its agent(s) to register, the Shares to be issued upon the exercise of my stock option(s) in the name of Merrill Lynch (or its designated nominee), which is my agent and nominee (or in the event that is not permissible, in my name).
I also authorize and instruct the Issuer to deliver, or cause its agent(s) to deliver within three business days, the Shares issued pursuant to the stock option exercise to Merrill Lynch in exchange for funds from Merrill Lynch representing the exercise price (plus any applicable taxes). I cannot revoke or rescind this authorization and instruction under any circumstance while the Plan is in effect. I hereby grant a security interest to Merrill Lynch in the Shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of my employee stock option(s). This security interest will not terminate even if the securities are delivered to me contrary to these instructions. If I am selling all or some of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of my employee stock option, I agree that I am responsible for any and all dividends, rights or payments of any kind that are or may become payable to any purchaser of the Shares prior to the registration of the Shares in the name of Merrill Lynch and, if I am holding all or some of these Shares, I agree that I shall not be entitled to such dividends, rights or payments prior to the issuance of the Shares. I agree to pay or deliver to Merrill Lynch upon demand, any and all funds, securities, dividends or distributions due to it, if, for any reason, the Shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of my employee stock option are not promptly delivered to Merrill Lynch. 2. EXECUTION, AVERAGE PRICING AND PRO RATA ALLOCATION OF SALES 2.1. I agree and acknowledge that: 1. If my order to sell Shares pursuant to the Plan, whether market or limit, is handled by a Merrill Lynch trading desk, my order shall be handled as "not held". A "not held" or "working order" permits a Merrill Lynch trader to use reasonable brokerage judgment, exercising price and time discretion, as to when to execute the order. 2. Merrill Lynch may execute my order: (a) in a single transaction or multiple transactions during the course of the trading day, or (b) it may aggregate my order with other orders for other sellers of the Issuer's securities that may or may not have been accepted pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 sales plan, execute them as a block or in multiple smaller transactions, and allocate an average price to each seller. 3. When orders are aggregated, Merrill Lynch shall allocate the proceeds of shares sold pro rata among the sellers, based on the ratio of (x) the shares to be sold and (y) the sum of the proceeds of all shares sold, and Merrill Lynch will provide each seller an "average price confirmation" that identifies the amount of securities sold for the applicable seller together with an average price for sales.
3. STOCK SPLITS/REINCORPORATION/REORGANIZATIONS 3.1 In the event of a stock split or reverse stock split, the quantity and price at which the Shares are to be sold will be automatically adjusted proportionately. 3.2 In the event of a reincorporation or other corporate reorganization resulting in an automatic share-for-share exchange of new shares for the Shares subject to the Plan, then the new shares will automatically replace the Shares originally specified in the Plan. 4. ACCOUNT CREDIT 4.1 In the event any scheduled sale of Shares or exercise of stock options and sale of the underlying Shares is not executed as provided in Section 1 (or Section 7, if applicable) of the Plan, my account will be credited as if such sale or exercise had taken place as scheduled in Section 1 or provided in Section 7. 5. COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144 AND RULE 145 5.1 I understand and agree that if I am an affiliate or control person for purposes of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), or if the Shares subject to the Plan are restricted securities subject to limitations under Rule 144 or eligible for resale under Rule 145, then all sales of Shares under the Plan will be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of Rule 144. 5.2 I request and authorize Merrill Lynch to complete and file on my behalf any Forms 144 (pre-signed by me) necessary to effect sales under the Plan. 5.3 If appropriate, I understand and agree that, upon my prompt signature and delivery to Merrill Lynch of Form 144, Merrill Lynch will either: (a) make one Form 144 filing at the beginning of each three-month period commencing with the date of the first sale made in connection with the Plan or (b) file Form 144 for each sale made in connection with the Plan. 5.4 Each Form 144 shall state the following: "This proposed sale is made pursuant to a plan intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1(c), previously entered into on [insert plan adoption date], at which time I was not aware of material nonpublic information." 5.5 Merrill Lynch will conduct sales pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 145 if appropriate, including applying Rule 144 volume limitations as if the sales under the Plan were the only sales subject to the volume limitations. 5.6. I agree not to take any action or to cause any other person or entity to take any action that would require me to aggregate sales of Shares pursuant to Rule 144; and not to take any action that would cause the sales of Shares under the Plan not to comply with Rule 144 or Rule 145.
6. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS In consideration of Merrill Lynch accepting orders to sell securities under this Plan, I make the following representations, warranties and covenants: 6.1 I have established the Plan in good faith, in compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, and I am not aware of material nonpublic information about the Shares or the Issuer. 6.2 I have consulted with legal counsel and other advisors in connection with my decision to enter into the Plan and have confirmed that the Plan meets the criteria set forth in Rule 10b5-1. I have not received or relied on any representations by Merrill Lynch regarding the Plan's compliance with Rule 10b5-1. 6.3. I own all Shares that are subject to the Plan free and clear of liens or encumbrances of any kind. I will own any Shares acquired under employee stock options exercised pursuant to the Plan free and clear of liens or encumbrances, except for any liens or encumbrances in favor of Merrill Lynch. There are no restrictions imposed on me, the Shares or the Issuer that would prevent Merrill Lynch or me from complying with the Plan. 6.4. While the Plan is in effect, except as provided in the Plan, I will not engage in offsetting or hedging transactions in violation of Rule10b5-1; and I will notify Merrill Lynch in advance of any sales or purchases of, or derivative transactions on, any of the Issuer's securities initiated by me. 6.5. While the Plan is in effect, I will not disclose to any employee of Merrill Lynch, including my Private Wealth Advisor or Financial Advisor, any material nonpublic information concerning the Shares or the Issuer. 6.6. While the Plan is in effect, I will not attempt to exercise any influence over how, when or whether to effect sales of Shares. 6.7. The Plan does not violate the Issuer's insider trading policies. 6.8. I agree to make or cause to be made all filings required under the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act, including under Rule 144 and pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and any other filings necessary. 6.9. As to delivery requirements:
1. For securities other than stock options, prior to the date of execution of any sales specified under the Plan, I agree to have delivered into the custody of Merrill Lynch the total amount of the Shares that may be sold pursuant to the Plan, together with all transfer documents and other authorizations required for Merrill Lynch to effect settlement of sales of such Shares on my behalf. 2. For employee stock options, the number of options granted to me by the Issuer that are vested, exercisable and registered is equal to or greater than the number of options to be exercised and the underlying Shares to be sold under the Plan. I agree to provide to Merrill Lynch all necessary documentation, properly executed, to effect the timely exercise of the stock options and the subsequent sale and settlement of the Shares. 3. I agree that Merrill Lynch's obligation to execute sales under the Plan is conditioned on the satisfaction of the foregoing delivery requirements. 6.10. I agree to inform Merrill Lynch as soon as possible of any of the following: 1. any subsequent restrictions imposed on me due to changes in the securities (or other) laws or of any contractual restrictions imposed on the Issuer that would prevent Merrill Lynch or me from complying with the Plan, and 2. the occurrence of any event as set forth in the Plan that would cause the Plan to be suspended or terminated under Section 7 or Section 8 of the Plan, respectively. 7. SUSPENSION 7.1 Sales pursuant to Section 1 above shall be suspended where: 1. trading of the Shares on the Exchange is suspended for any reason; 2. there is insufficient demand for any or all of the Shares at or above the specified price (e.g., the specified price met but all Shares could not be sold at or above the specified price); 3. Merrill Lynch, in its sole discretion, determines that there is a legal, regulatory or contractual reason why it cannot effect a sale of Shares; 4. Merrill Lynch is notified in writing by me that a sale of Shares should not be effected due to legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions applicable to the Issuer or to me (including without limitation, Regulation M); 5. Merrill Lynch is notified in writing by me that (i) in the case of Shares being sold pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act, the registration statement has terminated, been suspended, expired or is otherwise
unavailable; or (ii) a public announcement of a public offering of securities by the Issuer has been made. 7.2 Merrill Lynch will resume sales in accordance with the Plan as promptly as practicable after (a) Merrill Lynch receives notice in writing from the Issuer that it may resume sales in accordance with Section 1 of the Plan in the case of the occurrence of an Event described in 7.1.4 or 7.1.5 above or (b) Merrill Lynch determines, in its sole discretion, that it may resume sales in accordance with the Plan in the case of the occurrence of an Event described in 7.1.1, 7.1.2 or 7.1.3 above. 7.3 Shares allocated under the Plan for sale during a period that has elapsed due to a suspension under this Section will be carried forward to be sold with the next amount of shares to be sold in accordance with Section 1 of the Plan. In the event Section 1 of the Plan provides for an amount of Shares to be sold during a given period pursuant to a limit order, Shares that would otherwise be permitted to be sold during that period, shall, upon lapse of the suspension, nonetheless be carried forward to be sold with the next amount of Shares to be sold in accordance with Section 1 of the Plan. 7.4 Merrill Lynch is released from all liability in connection with any suspension of sales, including, but not limited to, liability for the expiration of stock options or loss of market value. 8.

9. INDEMNIFICATION 9.1 I agree to indemnify and hold harmless Merrill Lynch and its directors, officers, employees and affiliates from and against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities, including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such claim, arising out of or attributable to Merrill Lynch's actions taken in compliance with the Plan, any breach by me of the Plan, or any violation by me of applicable federal or state laws or regulations. This indemnification shall survive termination of the Plan. 9.2 Merrill Lynch agrees to indemnify and hold me harmless from and against all claims, losses, damages and liabilities including, without limitation, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with defending or investigating any such action or claim, arising out of or attributable to Merrill Lynch's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with the Plan. 10.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
     (a) 2007 Management Incentive Plan.
On August 8, 2006, the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied") adopted the fiscal 2007 Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP") for executive officers under the 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "LTPP"). The MIP is Applied's program for rewarding officers for achieving annual goals. The size of the incentive payments depends on the level of performance achieved relative to earnings per share goals set by the Committee. MIP payments can range from 0% to 200% (for outstanding achievement) of the target incentive values the Committee established for each officer. A copy of the 2007 MIP General Terms is attached as Exhibit 10(a) to this Form.
     (b) 2007-2009 Performance Grants.
On August 8, 2006, the Committee also adopted the 2007-2009 Performance Grant program under the LTPP. The Committee has made annual awards of three-year performance grants to the executive officers since fiscal 2002. The payout at the end of the three-year performance period is calculated based on Applied's achievement of performance goals over that period. Goals are based on sales growth, return on sales, and total shareholder return. Payouts can range from 0% to 200% (for outstanding achievement) of the target incentive values the Committee established for each officer, and are made in cash, Applied common stock, or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee. A copy of the Performance Grant Terms and Conditions is attached as Exhibit 10(b) to this Form.
     (c) Stock Appreciation Rights.
The Committee also awarded non-qualified stock-settled stock appreciation rights to the executive officers under the LTPP on August 8, 2006. A form of the Stock Appreciation Rights Award Terms and Conditions was filed as Exhibit 10(c) to our Form 8-K filed on August 9, 2005.

 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported record sales and earnings for the fiscal 2007 second quarter ended December 31, 2006.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, January 18, 2007
Net sales for the second quarter increased 4% to $472,365,000 from $456,180,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 21% to $18,568,000, or $0.42 per share, compared to $15,294,000, or $0.33 per share last year. This 27% increase in earnings per share represents the seventeenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases of at least 20 percent.

today reported record sales and earnings for the fiscal 2007 third quarter ended March 31, 2007.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 18, 2007  Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT)
Net sales for the third quarter increased 4.8% to $521.1 million from $497.2 million in the comparable period a year ago. Earnings per share increased to $0.49 versus $0.43 last year, up 14%. Last year's earnings included a $0.03 per share favorable impact that resulted from the timing of purchasing incentives relating to purchases made in prior periods.
For the nine-month period ended March 31, 2007, sales increased 6.4% to $1.486 billion from $1.397 billion in the same period last year. Operating income for the nine months was up 13.3%. Earnings per share increased to $1.37 versus $1.13 last year, up 21%.
Commenting on the results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "We are pleased with our quarterly results which showed improvement in sales growth compared to our second quarter. While the economic expansion is less robust than it was last fiscal year, our actions to reduce operating costs helped us continue our improvement in earnings.
"As we enter our fourth fiscal quarter, we maintain our annual earnings guidance of $1.80 to $1.85 per share on sales of $2.01 to $2.04 billion."
During the quarter, the Company purchased 880,000 shares of its common stock in open market transactions for $21.6 million. At March 31, 2007, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase 99,000 additional shares.

EXHIBIT 99
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported record sales and earnings for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2007 year ended June 30. Fiscal 2007 sales increased 6.0% to $2,014,109,000 from $1,900,780,000 in fiscal 2006. Net income for the year rose 19.0% to $86,022,000 versus $72,299,000 in the previous year. Earnings per share for the year increased 22.9% to $1.93 compared with $1.57 last year.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, August 9, 2007
Net sales for the fourth quarter increased 4.7% to $528,025,000 from $504,197,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 22.2% to $24,640,000 compared to $20,165,000 last year. Fourth quarter earnings per share increased 27.3% to $0.56 from $0.44 last year.
Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "Fiscal 2007 was a record sales year for Applied, though the economic expansion was less robust than it was a year ago. The current slump in the housing industry has impacted some of our key related markets, as has the sluggish performance by the automobile manufacturing sector. Offsetting the slowdown in sales growth, we have had good focus on operating fundamentals.
"Our operating margin increased from 6.1% last year to 6.7% in fiscal 2007. Combined with appropriate asset control, this allowed us to once again generate significant cash flow, giving us a strong balance sheet with which to pursue other strategic growth opportunities. As certain segments of the economy improve, we believe we are in a strong position to leverage sales gains into even stronger earnings performance.
"Looking ahead, we expect to continue our growth in fiscal 2008 and achieve earnings of $2.05 to $2.15 per share on sales of $2.10 to $2.18 billion."
During 2007, the Company purchased 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock on the open market for approximately $34 million. These shares represent approximately 3% of the shares outstanding. At June 30, 2007, the Company had remaining authorization to repurchase 1.5 million shares on the open market.
 
Applied will host its fourth quarter conference call for investors and analysts at 4 p.m today. The call will be conducted by Chairman & CEO David L. Pugh, President Bill L. Purser, Executive Vice President & COO Ben Mondics, and CFO Mark O. Eisele. To join the call, dial 1-800-818-5264, or use the live audio webcast accessible at http://www.Applied.com.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1) Cost of sales for interim financial statements are computed using estimated gross profit percentages which are adjusted throughout the year based upon available information. Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based on periodic physical inventory and the effect of year-end inventory quantities on LIFO costs. Reductions in year end inventories during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of these liquidations for the year ended June 30, 2006 increased gross profit by $1,647, net income by $1,013 and diluted net income per share by $0.02, respectively. There were no LIFO layer liquidations for fiscal 2007 and 2005.
(2) The Company's $50 million in senior unsecured term notes mature in December 2007 and have been classified as a current liability as of June 30, 2007.

(1) 2008 Management Incentive Plan.
On August 9, 2007, the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied") adopted the fiscal 2008 Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP") for executive officers under the 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "LTPP"). The MIP is Applied's program for rewarding officers for achieving annual goals. The size of the incentive payments depends on the level of performance achieved relative to net income goals set by the Committee. MIP payments can range from 0% to 200% (for outstanding achievement) of the target incentive value the Committee established for each officer. A copy of the 2008 MIP General Terms is attached as Exhibit 10(a) to this Form.
(2) Stock Appreciation Rights.
The Committee also awarded non-qualified stock-settled stock appreciation rights to the executive officers under the LTPP on August 9, 2007. A copy of updated Stock Appreciation Rights Award Terms and Conditions is attached as Exhibit 10(b) to this Form.
(3) Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Plan (Post-2004 Terms).
The Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Plan (the "SERP") is a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan in which designated Applied executive officers participate. The Committee approved the following changes to the SERP with respect to benefits accrued or vested after December 31, 2004:
 
In order to implement the changes described above, the SERP has been bifurcated into two parts, the first of which is applicable to vested accrued benefits on December 31, 2004 governed by the SERP provisions on such date; the second of which is applicable to benefits accrued and vested after December 31, 2004 (the "Post-2004 Terms"). The Post-2004 Terms are attached as Exhibit 10(c) to this Form.

EXHIBIT 10(a)
Authority
The 2008 Management Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is established by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (the "Committee") under the 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "1997 LTPP").
Objective
The Plan's objective is to reward eligible participants for their contributions toward the achievement of Applied's 2008 fiscal year business goals.
Participation
The Plan's participants are those key employees of Applied who are designated as Plan participants by the Committee.
Plan Goals
The Committee shall establish the Plan's goals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of (i) a merger, a consolidation, an acquisition or divestiture, the issuance or repurchase of a substantial amount of capital stock, a reorganization or restructuring, or any other transaction or series of transactions, or (ii) asset write-downs, or litigation or claim judgments or settlements, or foreign exchange gains or losses, or (iii) changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, or (iv) other extraordinary nonrecurring items, then the Committee, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Plan goals, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be conferred, in such manner as the Committee determines is equitably required by the changes or events.
Eligibility for Awards
If Plan goals are met, to be eligible for an award under the Plan, a participant must comply with the terms and conditions of the 1997 LTPP. In addition, except as provided in the 1997 LTPP, the participant must be actively employed by Applied on June 30, 2008, except that,
 
Other
The Committee has the authority to construe the Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations, in the Committee's judgment, necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration.
The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency with respect to the Plan in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under these provisions shall be conclusive for all purposes.

 
EXHIBIT 10(b)
Your Stock Appreciation Rights Award (the "SARs" or the "Award") is made by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Applied"). For purposes of these terms and conditions, employment by a parent, subsidiary, or an affiliate of Applied shall be considered employment by Applied.
The Award is governed by Applied's 1997 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan"), including the policies adopted by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of Applied's Board of Directors (the "Committee") under the Plan, and these terms and conditions. Upon valid exercise, the Award entitles you to receive such number of shares of Applied common stock ("Shares") that have a fair market value equal to the difference (if positive) between the fair market value of (a) a Share on the date of exercise over (b) the Base Price, multiplied by (c) the number of Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised, subject to the following conditions:
1. Grant of SARs; Exercisability.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2 and 7, below, your Award will be exercisable only if and after you have remained in Applied's continuous employ from the Award's grant date (the "Grant Date") to the vesting date of all or the specified portion of your Award. Your Award vests with respect to only 25% of the aggregate number of Shares to which it relates after one year of continuous employment from the Grant Date, which percentage increases to 50% after two years, to 75% after three years, and to 100% after four years of continuous employment from the Grant Date.
(b) Your Award shall expire at the end of the 10-year period commencing with the Grant Date (the "Term"), or upon such earlier expiration or separation from service date as may be provided by Sections 2 and 7 below. The SARs shall not be exercisable thereafter.
If, during the Term, you incur a separation from service from Applied for any reason, you may exercise your SARs, to the extent you were entitled to exercise them immediately prior to your separation from service, at any time within three months after your separation from service (but only during the Term); , that (a) if you retire under an Applied retirement plan, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within three years after your retirement (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; (b) if you incur a separation from service due to your permanent and total disability, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your separation from service (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; and (c) if you die while employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your death (but only during the Term), the person entitled by will or applicable law to exercise the SARs may do so.
2. Termination of SARs.
provided, however
Notwithstanding anything in these terms and conditions to the contrary, your Award may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required to immediately repay all Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous six months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee, or Applied's chief executive officer or president, determines, in any of their sole discretion, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending six months following your separation from service, you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include (but are not limited to) insubordination, willful inattention to
 
duty or violation of Applied's published policies, illegal or immoral acts, acts of fraud or dishonesty, solicitation of Applied's employees, customers or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment, unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees or customers, and competition with Applied. The determination shall be effective at the time of your act and shall be final and binding in all respects. The provisions of this Section 2 are a fundamental term of your Award and your Award shall be deemed forfeitable throughout the term of your employment and for the six month period following your separation from service.
During your life, your Award may be exercised only by you, your guardian, or legal representative. Upon your death, your Award may be exercised by the person entitled by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
3. Method of Exercise; Rights of Holder.
Your SARs may be exercised by delivering to Applied at its principal executive offices (directed to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Secretary) a written notice (which may include facsimile transmission or electronic mail), signed by you or such other person entitled to exercise the SARs, of the election to exercise the SARs and stating the number of Shares as to which the SARs are being exercised. The SARs shall be deemed exercised as of the date Applied receives the notice. If the SARs are exercised, as provided herein, by any person other than you, the notice shall be accompanied by appropriate evidence of that person's right to exercise the SARs. As a condition to your valid exercise of the SARs, you hereby consent to Applied withholding from the Shares issuable upon exercise (if any), such number of Shares the fair market value of which Applied determines to be equal to the amount required to be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state or local law, including tax withholding requirements. Promptly following the proper exercise of the SARs, Applied shall issue in the name of the person exercising the SARs, a certificate representing the Shares due hereunder. Your SARs may be exercised only with respect to a whole number of Shares, and may not be exercised in fractional amounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and the restrictions on exercise contained in Section 2, if a Change in Control of Applied occurs, then your SARs then outstanding shall become fully exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled under this Award or the Plan, including the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c) below. In the event of the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c), the provisions in Section 7 purporting to terminate your SARS shall not apply and you shall have the option either to exercise your rights under Section 7 or to deem the SARs assumed by the successor within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever is more favorable to you.
As an SAR holder, you shall have absolutely no rights as a shareholder, whether before or after vesting of all or any portion of your Award.
Your SARs shall not be exercisable if such exercise or the issuance of Shares pursuant to your Award would violate:
4. Limitations on Exercise.
(a) Any state securities law;
(b) Any registration or other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any stock exchange's listing requirements; or
(c) Any other legal requirement of any governmental authority.
 
If your exercise of SARs is prevented by the terms of any of the foregoing subsections, and the Term of the SARs expires, then you may, within 30 days after Applied notifies you that your exercise is no longer prevented by this Section 4, exercise the SARs to the extent they would have been exercisable but for the operation of this Section 4.
Furthermore, if a registration statement with respect to Shares issuable upon exercise of the SARs is not in effect or if Applied's counsel otherwise deems it necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible violations of the Act, Applied may require, as a condition to its issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares, the delivery to Applied of a commitment in writing by the person exercising the SARs that (i) at the time of the exercise it is his intention to acquire the Shares for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof; (ii) the person understands that the Shares may be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 issued under the Act; and (iii) any resale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares will be accomplished only in compliance with Rule 144, the Act, or other or subsequent rules and regulations thereunder. Applied may place on the certificates representing the Shares a legend reflecting that commitment and Applied may refuse to permit transfer of the Shares until it has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it that no violation of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would be involved in the transfer.
The Award is not a guaranty of employment or commitment by Applied of continued employment. Nothing in the Award or these terms and conditions alters, limits or restricts any right Applied would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of your employment.
5. No Guaranty of Employment.
The Award is not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, and may not be otherwise disposed of by you, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or with the prior written consent of Applied.
6. Nonassignability.
If (a) Applied is to be merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity so that Applied is not the surviving corporation and, immediately after such event, the holders of Shares immediately prior to the event hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity, (b) Applied is to be dissolved or liquidated, or (c) substantially all of Applied's assets are to be sold, then the Committee shall give you 30 days' prior written notice. Upon the giving of that notice, if you are employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully vested and exercisable. Within the 30-day period (but only during the Term), you shall have the right to exercise your SARs. Thereafter, notwithstanding any other provision of these terms and conditions, the SARs shall expire, unless "assumed" by another corporation within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
7. Liquidation, Dissolution, Merger, Sale of Substantially All Assets.
In the event (a) of a stock dividend or stock split or (b) the Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the Shares purchasable or the Base Price hereunder shall be equitably adjusted so that the SARs represent the right to acquire Shares or the number and kind of other securities that are economically equivalent to what the Shares would have represented had the SARs been fully exercised immediately preceding such event.
8. Adjustments.
In the event other changes or events relating to the Shares fundamentally change the value of the Shares or securities for which the SARs are exercisable, then the Committee may make, in its sole discretion, such adjustments in the terms of the SARs as the Committee may determine is equitably required by the change or event.
The Committee shall have authority, subject to the Plan's express provisions, to construe these terms and conditions and the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules and
9. Committee Authority.
 
regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the Committee's judgment necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or these terms and conditions in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under this Section shall be conclusive for all purposes.
In the event of any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and any provision of the Plan or the Committee's policies, the Plan or the policies shall govern. Terms used but not otherwise defined in these terms and conditions shall have the meaning ascribed them in the Plan.

If any Beneficiary designated hereunder dies after becoming entitled to receive a distribution from the Plan and before such distribution is made to him in full, and if no other person or persons have been designated to receive such distribution upon the happening of such contingency, the estate of such deceased Beneficiary shall become the Beneficiary as to such distribution.
9.1
Designation of Beneficiary
.
          Upon the death of a Participant to whom supplemental normal, early, or deferred retirement benefits under the Plan have not yet commenced to be paid or upon the death of a Participant to whom supplemental normal, early, or deferred retirement benefits under the Plan have commenced to be paid, the Beneficiary of such Participant shall receive the present actuarial equivalent of the Accrued Portion of the Participant's supplemental normal, early, or deferred retirement benefit as of the earlier of the date benefits under the Plan commenced to be paid to the Participant or his death minus the aggregate benefit payments, if any, made to such Participant under the Plan. Any such death benefit shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.6 and paid in a single sum as soon as reasonably possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article IX, no death benefit shall be reduced due to the payment of supplemental disability benefits under the Plan.
9.2
Death Benefit
.
 
          The Company shall be responsible for the general administration of the Plan, for carrying out the provisions hereof, and for making, or causing a grantor trust to make, any required supplemental benefit payments under the Plan. The Company shall have all such powers as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of the Plan, including the power to determine all questions relating to eligibility for and the amount of any supplemental retirement benefit and all questions pertaining to claims for benefits and procedures for claim review; to resolve all other questions arising under the Plan, including any questions of construction; and to take such further action as the Company shall deem advisable in the administration of the Plan. The Company may delegate any of its powers, authorities, or responsibilities for the operation and administration of the Plan to any person or committee so designated in writing by it and may employ such attorneys, agents, and accountants as it may deem necessary or advisable to assist it in carrying out its duties hereunder. The actions taken and the decisions made by the Company hereunder shall be final and binding upon all interested parties.
10.1
Authority of the Company
.
          Generally benefits shall be paid under the Post-2004 Terms without the necessity of filing a claim. A Participant, Beneficiary, or other person who believes he is entitled to a benefit under the Post-2004 Terms (hereinafter referred to as the "Claimant") may file a written claim with the Company. A claim must state with specificity the determination desired by the Claimant.
10.2
Claims Procedure
.
          The Company shall consider the Claimant's claim within a reasonable time, but no later than 90 days of receipt of the claim. If the Company determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim, the Company shall notify the Claimant in writing of the extension before the end of the initial 90-day period and the written notice shall indicate the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Company expects to make a decision. The extension of time shall not exceed 90 days from the end of the initial 90-day period.
 
          The Company shall notify the Claimant (in writing or electronically) that a determination has been made and that the claim is either allowed in full or denied in whole or in part. If the claim is denied in whole or in part, the Company shall notify (in writing or electronically) such Claimant or an authorized representative of the Claimant, as applicable, of any adverse benefit determination within 90 days of receipt of the claim. Any adverse benefit determination notice shall describe the specific reason or reasons for the denial, refer to the specific Plan provisions on which the determination was based, describe any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect his claim and explain why that material or information is necessary, describe the Plan's review procedures and the time limits applicable to those procedures, including a statement of the Claimant's right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following a denial upon review. If the notification is made electronically, it must comply with applicable Department of Labor Regulations.
          Upon receipt of an adverse benefit determination, a Claimant may, within 60 days after receiving notification of that determination, submit a written request asking the Board to review the Claimant's claim. Each Claimant, when making his request for review of his adverse benefit determination, shall have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and any other information relating to the claim for benefits. Each Claimant shall also be provided, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to such Claimant's claim for benefits. The review shall take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by the Claimant relating to the claim, regardless of whether the information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit determination. If a Claimant does not submit his request for review in writing within the 60-day period described above, his claim shall be deemed to have been conclusively determined for all purposes of the Plan and the adverse benefit determination will be deemed to be correct.
          If the Claimant submits in writing a request for review of the adverse benefit determination within the 60-day period described above, the Board (or its designee) shall notify
 
(in writing or electronically) him of its determination on review within a reasonable period of time but not later than 60 days from the date of receipt of his request for review, unless the Board (or its designee) determines that special circumstances require an extension of time. If the Board (or its designee) determines that an extension of time for processing a Claimant's request for review is required, the Board (or its designee) shall notify him in writing before the end of the initial 60-day period and inform him of the special circumstances requiring an extension of time and the date by which the Board (or its designee) expects to render its determination on review. The extension of time will not exceed 60 days from the end of the initial 60-day period.
          If the Board (or its designee) confirms the adverse benefit determination upon review, the notification will describe the specific reason or reasons for the adverse determination, refer to the specific Plan provisions on which the benefit determination is based, include a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to the Claimant's claim and include a statement describing the Claimant's right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA, and any other required information under applicable Department of Labor Regulations. The claims procedure described above shall be administered in a manner not inconsistent with Section 503 of ERISA and applicable Department of Labor Regulations.
          A Claimant's compliance with the foregoing claims procedures shall be a mandatory prerequisite to the Claimant's right to commence any legal action with respect to any claim for benefits under the Plan.
 
          The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time by action of the Board; provided, however, that no such action shall adversely affect any Participant who is receiving supplemental retirement benefits or supplemental disability benefits under the Plan or who has accrued a supplemental retirement benefit under the Plan, unless an equivalent benefit is provided under another plan sponsored by the Company.
 
          No benefit under the Plan shall at any time be subject in any manner to alienation or encumbrance. If any Participant shall attempt to, or shall, alienate or in any way encumber his rights or benefits under the Plan, or any part thereof, or if by reason of his bankruptcy or other event happening at any time any such benefits would otherwise be received by anyone else or would not be enjoyed by him, his interest in all such benefits shall automatically terminate and the same shall be held or applied to or for the benefit of such person, his spouse, children, or other dependents as the Company may select.
12.1
Non-Alienation of Benefits
.
          If any Participant to whom a benefit is payable under the Plan is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident, any payment due (unless prior claim therefor shall have been made by a duly qualified guardian or other legal representative) may be paid to the spouse, parent, brother, sister, adult child, or any other individual deemed by the Company to be maintaining or responsible for the maintenance of such person. Any payment made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 12.2 shall be a complete discharge of any liability of the Plan with respect to the benefit so paid.
12.2
Payment of Benefits to Others
.
          Nothing herein contained shall be construed as a commitment or agreement on the part of any Participant to continue his employment with the Company, and nothing herein contained shall be construed as a commitment on the part of the Company to continue the employment or the annual rate of compensation of any Participant for any period, and all Participants shall remain subject to discharge to the same extent as if the Plan had never been established.
12.3
Plan Non-Contractual
.
          In order to provide a source of payment for its obligations under the Plan, the Company may establish a grantor trust.
12.4
Trust
.
          The obligation of the Company under the Plan to provide a Participant with supplemental retirement benefits or supplemental disability benefits
12.5
Interest of a Participant
.
 
constitutes the unsecured promise of the Company to make payments as provided herein, and no person shall have any interest in, or a lien or prior claim upon, any property of the Company.
          The provisions of the Plan shall in no event be construed as giving any person, firm or corporation any legal or equitable right against the Company, its officers, employees, or directors, except any such rights as are specifically provided for in the Plan or are hereafter created in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Plan.
12.6
Claims of Other Persons
.
          Although the Company shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, penalties and/or interest under Section 409A, tax treatment of benefits under the Plan is not warranted or guaranteed. No liability shall attach to the Company, any Affiliate, the Board of Directors of the Company, or any delegate for any tax, penalty, interest or other monetary amounts owed by any Participant, Beneficiary or other person as a result of the accrual or payment of a benefit under the Plan.
12.7
Section 409A
.
          The invalidity or unenforceability of any particular provision of the Plan shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the Plan shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid or unenforceable provision were omitted herefrom.
12.8
Severability
.
          The provisions of the Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio.
12.9
Governing Law
.
          Executed at Cleveland, Ohio, this 14 day of August, 2007.

7. Awards
     The Committee shall determine the type or types of Award(s) to be made to each Participant and shall set forth in the related Award Agreement the terms, conditions and limitations applicable to each Award. Awards may include but are not limited to those listed in this Section. Awards may be granted singly, in combination or in tandem or in exchange for a previously granted Award; provided that the exercise price for stock options shall not be less than the Fair Market Value on the date of grant of the new Award. Awards
 
may also be made in combination or in tandem with, in replacement of, or as alternatives to, grants or rights under any other employee plan of the Company, including the plan of any acquired entity.
     (a)  A grant of a right to purchase a specified number of Common Shares during a specified period and at a specified price not less than the Fair Market Value on the date of grant, as determined by the Committee. A stock option may be in the form of an incentive stock option("ISO") which, in addition to being subject to applicable terms, conditions and limitations established by the Committee, complies with Section 422 of the Code which, among other limitations, currently provides that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time the option is granted) of Common Shares exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any calendar year shall not exceed$100,000 (or such other limit as may be required by the Code); that the exercise price shall be not less than 100% of Fair Market Value on the date of the grant; that such options shall be exercisable for a period of not more than ten years and may be granted no later than ten years after the effective date of this Plan.
Stock Option
     (b)  A right to receive a payment, in cash and/or Common Shares, equal to the excess of the Fair Market Value or other specified valuation of a specified number of Common Shares on the date the SAR is exercised over the Fair Market Value or other specified valuation on the date of grant of the SAR as set forth in the applicable Award Agreement, except that where the SAR is granted in tandem with a stock option, the grant and exercise valuations must be no less than Fair Market Value.
Stock Appreciation Right or SAR
     (c)  An Award made in Common Shares and other Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, Common Shares. All or part of any stock award may be subject to conditions established by the Committee, and set forth in the Award Agreement.
Stock Award
     (d)  An Award denominated in cash with the eventual payment amount subject to future service and such other restrictions and conditions as may be established by the Committee, and as set forth in the Award Agreement. The maximum amount of any cash Award payable to any Participant in any one calendar year shall be three million dollars ($3,000,000).
Cash Award
     (e)(i) With respect to grants of Awards to any Section 162(m) Employee, the stock Awards and cash Awards made pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) shall be based on the satisfaction of performance goals established by the Committee at the time an Award is granted, which goals shall include one or more of the following: sales, costs and expenses, cash flow, pre-tax income, net income, operating profit and margin, earnings per share, retained earnings, return on equity, return on assets, return on investment, asset turnover, liquidity, capitalization, value created, stock price, total shareholder return, price measures, market share, sales to targeted customers, customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, safety measures, quality measures, productivity, process improvement, educational and
 
technical skills of employees, changes in one or more of the preceding, development of criteria for and programs related to hiring and promotion, creation and acquisition of new business units, development and implementation of business plans and programs relating to product lines or business units, integration of acquired businesses, development and implementation of employee training and development programs, implementation of tax and accounting elections, and development and implementation of communications and investor relations programs; provided however, that all performance goals shall be objective performance goals satisfying the requirements for "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m)(4) of the Code. Such performance goals may also be based on the attainment of levels of performance of the Company and/or any of its affiliates under one or more of the measures described above relative to the performance of other businesses.
     (ii) With respect to grants of Awards to any Participant who is not a Section 162(m) Employee, the Awards may be based on any of the goals described in paragraph (i) and on such other conditions as may be established by the Committee.
8. Payment of Awards
     Payment of Awards may be made in the form of cash, Common Shares or combinations thereof and may include such restrictions as the Committee shall determine, including in the case of Common Shares, restrictions on transfer and forfeiture provisions. When transfer of shares is so restricted or subject to forfeiture provisions, such shares are referred to as "Restricted Stock." Further, with Committee approval, payments may be deferred, either in the form of installments or a future lump sum payment. The Committee may permit selected Participants to elect to defer payments of some or all types of Awards in accordance with procedures established by the Committee to assure that such deferrals comply with applicable requirements of the Code including, at the choice of Participants, the capability to make further deferrals for payment after retirement. Any deferred payment, whether elected by the Participant or specified by the Award Agreement or by the Committee, may require the payment to be forfeited in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Plan. Dividends or dividend equivalent rights may be extended to and made part of any Award denominated in shares or units of shares, subject to such terms, conditions and restrictions as the Committee may establish. The Committee may also establish rules and procedures for the crediting of interest on deferred cash payments and dividend equivalents for deferred payments denominated in shares or units of shares. At the discretion of the Committee, a Participant may be offered an election to substitute an Award for another Award or Awards of the same or different type; provided that Awards may not be made to substitute for previously granted stock options having higher exercise prices.
 
9. Stock Option Exercise
     The price at which shares may be purchased under a stock option shall be paid in full at the time of the exercise in cash or, if permitted by the Committee, by means of tendering Common Shares or surrendering another Award, including Restricted Stock, valued at Fair Market Value on the date of exercise, or by any other means which the Committee determines to be consistent with the Plan's objectives and applicable law and regulations. The Committee shall determine acceptable methods for tendering Common Shares or other Awards and may impose such conditions on the use of Common Shares or other Awards to exercise a stock option as it deems appropriate. In the event shares of Restricted Stock are tendered as consideration for the exercise of a stock option, a number of the shares issued upon the exercise of the stock option, equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock used as consideration therefor, shall be subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock so submitted plus any additional restrictions that may be imposed by the Committee.
10. Tax Withholding
     The Company shall have the authority to withhold, or to require a Participant to remit to the Company, prior to issuance or delivery of any shares or cash hereunder, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state and local tax withholding requirements associated with any Award. In addition, the Company may, in its sole discretion, permit a Participant to satisfy any tax withholding requirements, in whole or in part, by (i) delivering to the Company Common Shares held by such Participant having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of the tax or (ii) directing the Company to retain Common Shares otherwise issuable to the Participant under the Plan. If Common Shares are used to satisfy tax withholding, such shares shall be valued based on the Fair Market Value when the tax withholding is required to be made.
11. Amendment, Modification, Suspension or Discontinuance of this Plan
     The Board or the Committee may amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Plan for the purpose of meeting or addressing any changes in legal requirements or for any other purpose permitted by law. Subject to changes in law or other legal requirements which would permit otherwise, the Plan may not be amended without consent of the holders of the majority of the Common Shares then outstanding, to(i) increase the aggregate number of Common Shares that may be issued under the Plan (except for adjustments pursuant to the Plan), (ii) materially modify the requirements as to eligibility for participation in the Plan, or (iii) withdraw administration of the Plan from the Committee.
     The Board or the Committee may amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but no such amendment shall impair the rights of any Participant without his consent and no such amendment shall have the effect, with respect to any Section 162(m) Employee, of increasing the amount of any Award from the amount that would otherwise be payable pursuant to the formula and/or goals previously
 
established for such Participant. The Board or the Committee may also make Awards hereunder in replacement of, or as alternatives to, Awards previously granted to Participants, except for previously granted options having higher exercise prices, but including without limitation grants or rights under any other plan of the Company or of any acquired entity.
12. Termination of Employment
     If the employment of a Participant terminates for any reason, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Awards shall be exercisable or paid in accordance with the applicable Award Agreement, which may provide that the Committee may authorize, as it deems appropriate, the acceleration and/or continuation of all or any part of Awards granted prior to such termination.
13. Cancellation and Rescission of Awards
     Unless the Award Agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Awards at any time if the Participant is not in compliance with all other applicable provisions of the Award Agreement, the Plan and with the following conditions:
     (a) A Participant shall not render services for any organization or engage directly or indirectly in any business which, in the judgment of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or other senior officer designated by the Committee, is or becomes competitive with the Company, or which organization or business, or the rendering of services to such organization or business, is or becomes otherwise prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of the Company. For Participants whose employment has terminated, the judgment of the Chief Executive Officer shall be based on the Participant's position and responsibilities while employed by the Company, the Participant's post-employment responsibilities and position with the other organization or business, the extent of past, current and potential competition or conflict between the Company and the other organization or business, the effect on the Company's customers, suppliers and competitors of the Participant's assuming the post-employment position, and such other considerations as are deemed relevant given the applicable facts and circumstances. A Participant who has retired shall be free, however, to purchase as an investment or otherwise, stock or other securities of such organization or business so long as they are listed upon a recognized securities exchange or traded over-the-counter, and such investment does not represent a substantial investment to the Participant or a greater than one percent (1%) equity interest in the organization or business.
     (b) A Participant shall not, without prior written authorization from the Company, disclose to anyone outside the Company, or use in other than the Company's business, any confidential information or material relating to the business of the Company, acquired by the Participant either during or after employment with the Company.
 
     (c) Upon exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to an Award, the Participant shall certify on a form acceptable to the Committee that he or she is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Failure to comply with the provisions of paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 13 prior to, or during the six months after, any exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to an Award (except in the event of an intervening Change in Control as defined below) shall cause such exercise, payment or delivery to be rescinded. The Company shall notify the Participant in writing of any such rescission within two years after such exercise, payment or delivery. Within ten days after receiving such a notice from the Company, the Participant shall pay to the Company the amount of any gain realized or payment received as a result of the rescinded exercise, payment or delivery pursuant to an Award. Such payment shall be made either in cash or by returning to the Company the number of Common Shares that the Participant received in connection with the rescinded exercise, payment or delivery.
14. Nonassignability
     Except as may be otherwise provided in the relevant Award Agreement, no Award or any benefit under the Plan shall be assignable or transferable, or payable to or exercisable by, anyone other than the Participant to whom it was granted.
15. Adjustments; Waiver of Restrictions
     (a) In the event of any change in capitalization of the Company by reason of a stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification of shares, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, spin-off, spin-out or other distribution of assets to shareholders, or similar event, the Committee may adjust proportionally (i) the Common Shares (1) reserved under the Plan, (2) available for ISOs and (3) covered by outstanding Awards denominated in stock or units of stock; (ii) the stock prices related to outstanding Awards; and (iii) the appropriate Fair Market Value and other price determinations for such Awards. In the event of any other change affecting the Common Shares or any distribution (other than normal cash dividends) to holders of capital stock, such adjustments as may be deemed equitable by the Committee, shall be made to give proper effect to such event. In the event of a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation, reorganization or liquidation, the Committee shall be authorized to issue or assume stock options, whether or not in a transaction to which Section 424of the Code applies, by means of substitution of new options for previously issued options or an assumption of previously issued options.
     (b) The Board may, in its sole discretion, based on such factors as the Board may deem appropriate, waive in whole or in part, any remaining restrictions or vesting requirements in connection with any Award hereunder.
 
16. Change in Control
     (a) In the event of a Change in Control (as defined below) of the Company, and except as the Board may expressly provide otherwise, (i) all stock options or SARs then outstanding shall become fully exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control, whether or not then exercisable, (ii) all restrictions and conditions of all stock Awards then outstanding shall be deemed satisfied as of the date of the Change in Control, and (iii) all cash Awards shall be deemed to have been fully earned as of the date of the Change in Control.
     (b) A "Change in Control" of the Company shall have occurred when any of the following events occur:
(i) The Company is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock(as that term is hereafter defined) of the Company immediately prior to such transaction;
(ii) The Company sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities o such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such sale;
(iii) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company ("Voting Stock");
(iv) The Company files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of the Company has or may have occurred or will or may occur in the future pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(v) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the directors of the Company cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided, however, that for purposes
 
of this clause (v), each director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by the Company's stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) then still in office who were directors of the Company at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of the Company at the beginning of such period.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section 16(b)(iii) or (iv) hereof, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of the Plan solely because (i) the Company, (ii) an entity in which the Company directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Company-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Company, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule 14D-1, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 20% or otherwise, or because the Company reports that a change in control of the Company has or may have occurred or will or may occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
17. Notice
     Any written notice to the Company required by any of the provisions of the Plan shall be addressed to the Chief Financial Officer or to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and shall become effective when it is received by the office of the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Executive Officer.
18. Unfunded Plan
     Insofar as it provides for Awards of cash and Common Shares, the Plan shall be unfunded. Although bookkeeping accounts may be established with respect to Participants who are entitled to cash, Common Shares or rights thereto under the Plan, any such accounts shall be used merely as a bookkeeping convenience. The Company shall not be required to segregate any assets that may at any time be represented by cash, Common Shares or rights thereto, nor shall the Plan be construed as providing for such segregation, nor shall the Company nor the Board nor the Committee be deemed to be a trustee of any cash, Common Shares or rights thereto to be granted under the Plan. Any liability of the Company to any Participant with respect to a grant of cash, Common Shares or rights thereto under the Plan shall be based solely upon any contractual obligations that may be created by the Plan and any Award Agreement; no such obligation of the Company shall be deemed to be secured by any pledge or other encumbrance on any property of the Company. Neither the Company nor the Board nor the Committee shall be required to give any security or bond for the performance of any obligation that may be created by the Plan.
 
19. Governing Law
     The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken pursuant hereto, to the extent not otherwise governed by the Code or the securities laws of the United States, shall be governed by the law of the State of Ohio and construed accordingly.
20. Rights of Employees
     Nothing in the Plan shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any subsidiary to terminate any Participant's employment at any time, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continued employment with the Company or any subsidiary.
21. Status of Awards
     Except to the extent specifically provided for in any other employee benefit plan of the Company, awards hereunder shall not be deemed compensation for purposes of computing benefits under any retirement plan of the Company and shall not affect any benefits under any other benefit plan now or hereafter in effect under which the availability or amount of benefits is related to the level of compensation.
22. Effective and Termination Dates
     The Plan shall become effective on the date it is first approved by shareholders by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of Common Shares at a meeting called for such purpose. The Plan shall continue in effect until (i) October 22, 2012, (ii) such earlier date established by the Board pursuant to Section 11, or (iii) such later date as may be approved in the future by the Board and the Company's shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Awards granted under the Plan prior to its termination shall remain outstanding in accordance with the terms of such Awards.

EXHIBIT 99
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported record second quarter sales and earnings. For its fiscal 2008 second quarter, ended December 31, 2007, net income rose 23.7% on a sales increase of 8.2%.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, January 23, 2008
Net sales for the second quarter increased to $511,008,000 from $472,365,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased to $22,967,000 or $0.52 per share compared to $18,568,000 or $0.42 per share last year.
For the six months ended December 31, 2007, sales increased 6.7% to $1,029,555,000 from $964,955,000 in the same period last year. Net income increased 19.5% to $47,424,000, or $1.08 per share versus $39,685,000, or $0.89 per share, last year.
Commenting on the Company's performance, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "We are pleased with the growth that we saw for the quarter and for the first half of our fiscal year. Our continued focus on managing operating fundamentals allowed us to post strong earnings and to continue our trend of double-digit EPS increases. In particular, our operating margin showed continued strength from our efforts to control costs and to better manage our assets.
"During the quarter, we saw business conditions that were mixed. Our sales to customers in housing-related industries continued to be impacted by the housing downturn. Sales to other industries such as metal mining and food production were very strong.
"Several economic indices we follow point to a slowing economy, and as a result, we expect the second half to be more challenging with regard to sales growth. However, we are increasing our annual earnings guidance based on the strength of our first-half performance, the full-year effect of our second quarter share repurchases, and the benefits from continued operational efficiencies. For fiscal 2008, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.25 on sales of $2.10 billion to $2.18 billion."
During the quarter, the Company purchased 710,000 shares of its common stock in open market transactions for $21.0 million. At December 31, 2007, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 790,000 additional shares.

ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported record third quarter sales and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2008.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 24, 2008
Net sales for the third quarter increased 1.7% to $530,156,000 from $521,129,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 8.7% to $23,595,000 from $21,697,000, and earnings per share increased 12.2% to $0.55 per share from $0.49 per share in the third quarter last year.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2008, sales increased 5% to $1,559,711,000 from $1,486,084,000 in the same period last year. Net income increased 15.7% to $71,019,000 or $1.62 per share versus $61,382,000, or $1.37 per share, last year.
"Although our quarterly sales growth rate declined slightly more than we thought it would, we are pleased in our ability to leverage our productivity improvements and continued cost controls to achieve a double-digit increase in earnings per share," stated David L. Pugh, Applied's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Sales during the quarter were impacted by the continued deterioration of the housing and the automotive markets, and this weakness appears to be migrating into other sectors as consumers and businesses are becoming a bit more anxious about the economy.
"While we do not expect significant economic improvement during the fourth quarter, based on our results to date and the continued strength in our operational controls, we expect fiscal 2008 sales to be within the lower range of our previously issued guidance of $2.10 billion to $2.18 billion. Earnings are now expected to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 per share, compared to prior guidance of $2.10 to $2.25 per share for fiscal 2008."
During the quarter, Applied purchased 435,000 shares of its common stock in open market transactions for $12.2 million. At March 31, 2008, Applied had remaining authorization to purchase 1,065,000 additional shares.
 
Applied will host its third quarter conference call for investors and analysts at 4 p.m. ET today (Thursday, April 24).

     On April 23, 2008, the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied") approved a new form of change in control agreement to be entered into between Applied and each of its executive officers, replacing the existing agreements.
     Applied has long maintained change in control agreements with its executive officers that provide for the payment to the executives of severance compensation, benefits, and certain expenses in the event of termination of employment by Applied without cause or termination of employment by the executive for good reason within the three-year period following a change in control. The agreements are intended to allow Applied to retain certain key management executives and to encourage them to devote their full attention to the business in the event of a possibility of a change in control.
     The new agreement form reflects two material changes from the existing form of agreement. The first change involves various provisions added to conform to the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A. The second change deletes a provision that allowed an executive to terminate his or her employment and receive severance benefits if the termination occurred during a 30-day window period following the first anniversary of the change in control.
     The new agreement form is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
99.1  Form of Change in Control Agreement between Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and certain executive officers
 
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
Date: April 25, 2008
 

 
EXHIBIT 99.1
Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. One Applied Plaza Cleveland, Ohio 44115
[Date]
[Name Address]
Dear :
                    
                    
     Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") considers it essential to the best interest of the Company and its shareholders that its management be encouraged to remain with the Company and to continue to devote full attention to the Company's business. In this connection, the Company recognizes that the possibility of a change in control may exist and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of key members of the Company's management, including yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company.
     In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company until the termination of your employment in conjunction with a "Change in Control" of the Company (as defined in Section 2 hereof), this letter agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the severance benefits that the Company agrees will be provided to you in the event your employment with the Company is terminated within the three year period immediately following any change in control of the Company either by you for "Good Reason" or by the Company "Without Cause" (both as defined in Section 3 hereof). In the event that a change in control of the Company does not occur, your severance benefits, if any, shall be determined without regard to this Agreement.
     Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prevent either you or the Company from terminating your employment at any time, for cause or otherwise, subject only to the specific payment and other provisions hereinafter set forth in this Agreement in the event that a Change in Control of the Company occurs prior to the date your termination becomes
 
effective. In addition, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated, and of no further force and effect, in the event that you cease to be a Board-elected officer or an appointed officer of the Company prior to a Change in Control. You hereby specifically acknowledge that your employment by the Company is employment-at-will, subject to termination by you, or by the Company, at any time with or without cause. You also acknowledge that such employment-at-will status cannot be modified except in a specific writing that has been authorized or ratified by the Board of Directors of the Company.
     1. . The parties agree that you have advised the Company that, in consideration of, among other things, the Company's entering into this Agreement with you, it is your present intention to remain in the employ of the Company unless and until there occurs a Change in Control of the Company.
Continued Employment
     2. . No benefits shall be payable hereunder unless a Change in Control of the Company occurs and your employment with the Company is terminated within three years thereafter either by you for Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause. This Agreement is not intended to apply to termination of your employment by reason of Death, Disability or Retirement (as defined in Section 3 hereof). For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of the Company shall mean:
Change in Control
     (a) The Company is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity and, immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization, the holders of Company voting stock immediately prior to the transaction hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity;
     (b) The Company sells substantially all of its assets to another entity and, immediately after such sale, the holders of Company voting stock immediately prior to the sale hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the purchaser;
     (c) A report is filed, or is required to be filed, on Schedule 13D or Schedule TO (or any successor form) disclosing that any "person" has become a "beneficial owner" (as those terms are defined by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of Company securities representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the Company;
     (d) The Company files, or is required to file, a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor form) that a Change in Control of the Company has or may have occurred, or will or may occur in the future, pursuant to a then-existing contract or transaction; or
     (e) Individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least three-fourths of the
 
Board, provided, however, that any individual becoming a director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies by or on behalf of a person other than the Board.
     Notwithstanding events set forth in subparagraphs (c) and (d) above, unless otherwise determined by a majority vote of the Board, a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have occurred solely because (i) the Company, (ii) an entity of which the Company directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the entity's voting stock, or (iii) any employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or proxy statement in response to Schedules 13D, TO or 14A, or Form 8-K (or any successor form), disclosing beneficial ownership by it of voting stock, whether in excess of 20% or otherwise, or because the Company reports that a change of control of the Company has or may have occurred, or will or may occur in the future, by reason of such beneficial ownership.
     The first date upon which a Change in Control as defined above takes place shall be known as the "Effective Date." Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change in Control occurs and if your employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change in Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by you that such termination (i) was at the request of a third party who had taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (ii) was by the Company and arose with or in anticipation of a Change in Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement your employment shall be deemed to have been terminated by the Company Without Cause under Section 3(f) of this Agreement and the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the Date of Termination (as defined in Section 3 hereof).
     3. . Your employment with the Company shall or may be terminated, as the case may be, for any of the following reasons; provided that in each case such termination of employment constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations issued thereunder ("Separation from Service"):
Termination of Employment
     (a) . Termination of your employment with the Company due to your death;
Death
     (b) . Termination of your employment with the Company at or after the attainment of age sixty-five (65);
Retirement
 
     (c) . Termination of your employment with the Company either by you or the Company after you are physically or mentally incapacitated for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days such that you cannot substantially perform your duties of employment with the Company on a full-time basis;
Disability
     (d) . Termination of your employment with the Company at any time for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
Cause
     (i) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than for Disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or
     (ii) the willful engagement by you in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this Section 3(d), no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without your reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given you pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. Termination of your employment with the Company shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to you and you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail;
     (e)(A) . You may separate from service with the Company for 409A Good Reason, provided that the notice and cure requirements set forth below are satisfied and provided further that such separation from service occurs no later than two years after one or more of the conditions constituting "409A Good Reason" occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, "409A Good Reason" shall mean:
409A Good Reason
 
     (i) a material diminution in your authority, duties, or responsibilities;
     (ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom you reported immediately prior to the Effective Date;
     (iii) a material diminution by the Company of your annual base salary that was provided to you by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Date;
     (iv) a material change in the geographic location where you provide service to the Company; or
     (v) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 12 of this Agreement;
provided that, for purposes of this Section 3(e), 409A Good Reason shall not have occurred unless you give the Company notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by you in good faith to constitute 409A Good Reason and the Company has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition.
     (B) . You may terminate your employment with the Company for Other Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Other Good Reason" shall mean:
Other Good Reason
     (i) the assignment of any duties inconsistent in any respect with your position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities, or any other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by you;
     (ii) any failure by the Company to continue to provide you with an annual base salary, employee benefits and an opportunity to earn incentive and bonus compensation equal or greater to that which was provided to you by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Date other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after the receipt of notice thereof given by you;
     (iii) the Company's requiring you to be based at or generally work from any location other than the location that you were based at or generally worked from prior to the Effective Date or the Company's
 
requiring you to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date; or
     (iv) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 12 of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Section 3(e)(B), your good faith determination of "Other Good Reason" shall be conclusiveYou shall specify in your notice of separation from service with the Company under Section 3(e)(A) or termination of employment under Section 3(e)(B) whether your separation or termination is for 409A Good Reason or Other Good Reason. If you fail to specify whether your notice is given pursuant to Section 3(e)(A) or Section 3(e)(B), the Company will presume that the notice is given pursuant to Section 3(e)(B). Collectively, 409A Good Reason and Other Good Reason may be collectively referred to herein as "Good Reason."
.
     (f) . The Company may terminate your employment with the Company Without Cause. For purposes of this Agreement the term "Without Cause" shall mean termination of your employment for reasons other than for Death, Retirement, Disability or Cause. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if, at any time prior to a Change in Control of the Company, you receive notice from the Company that you will be terminated Without Cause and will receive severance benefits under another arrangement between you and the Company, no benefits shall be payable to you hereunder.
Without Cause
     (g) . Except in the case of Death, termination of your employment shall be effective as of the earlier of the date specified by either you or the Company in a written notice of termination ("Notice of Termination") to the other party hereto or the date that you incur a Separation from Service (hereinafter referred to as the "Date of Termination").
Date of Termination
     4. .
Severance Pay
     (a) . If a Change in Control of the Company occurs and within three years thereafter your employment with the Company is terminated either by you for Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause, then in addition to all other benefits which you have earned prior to such termination or to which you are otherwise entitled, the Company shall pay to you as severance pay, the following amounts:
Amount of Severance Pay
     (i) your full base salary earned through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect ten days prior to the date Notice of Termination is given, to the extent not theretofore paid;
     (ii) an amount equal to the product of (1) the higher of your annual base salary in effect prior to the Effective Date or your annual base
 
salary at the highest rate in effect at any time since any Change in Control of the Company (including any annual base salary amounts deferred under any non-qualified deferred compensation program of the Company and any elective contributions of annual base salary that are made by or on behalf of you under any plan maintained by the Company that are not includible in gross income under Section 125 or 402(e) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, but excluding moving or educational reimbursement expenses, amounts realized from the exercise of any stock options or stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), and imputed income attributable to any fringe benefit) and (2) the lesser of the number three or a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months from and including the month in which the Date of Termination occurs to and including the month in which you would attain the age sixty-five and the denominator of which is twelve;
     (iii) in lieu of annual incentive compensation, commissions, and bonuses that would otherwise be payable, an amount equal to the product of (1) your target annual incentive compensation, commissions, and bonuses (excluding amounts realized from the exercise of any stock options or SARs), based on the deemed achievement of performance goals at the 100% level, for the then-current fiscal year of the Company and (2) the lesser of the number three or a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months from and including the month in which the Date of Termination occurs to and including the month in which you would attain the age sixty-five and the denominator of which is twelve;
     (iv) in lieu of either shares of Common Stock of the Company, without par value ("Company Shares") issuable upon exercise of options ("Options") and Company Shares issuable pursuant to any SARs, if any, granted to you under any Company stock option or equity incentive plan (which Options or SARs shall be deemed canceled upon the making of the payment herein referred to), you shall receive an amount in cash equal to the aggregate spread between the exercise prices of all such Options and the aggregate value of such SARs that are outstanding and held by you (whether or not then fully vested or exercisable) and the mean of the high and low trading prices of Company Shares on the New York Stock Exchange on the Date of Termination; and
     (v) an amount of cash equal to any unvested portion of your interest in any of the Company's tax-qualified pension plans as of the Date of Termination.
     (b) . Severance amounts hereunder shall be paid in cash in a lump sum payment (or payments) at the time(s) provided in Section 4(c).
Form of Severance Payment
 
     (c) .
Time of Payment(s)
     (i) . If at the Date of Termination you are a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder ("Specified Employee"), no payment shall be made hereunder prior to the first day that is six months after the Date of Termination; provided that the Specified Employee six-month delay under this Section 4(c)(i) shall be effective only to the extent that payment would constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder ("Section 409A"). Any lump sum payment that is subject to the Specified Employee 6-month delay shall be paid within the first 5 business days after the expiration of such 6-month delay. Any amount that is not "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A shall be paid within the first 5 business days after the Date of Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 4(c)(i), any payment under paragraph (iii) of Section 4(a) shall not be paid before the later of (1) the first 5 business days after the Date of Termination, or (2) the expiration of the Specified Employee 6-month delay, if applicable.
Specified Employee
     (ii) . If you are not a Specified Employee at the Date of Termination, the Company will pay the amounts described in (i), (ii), (iv), and (v) of Section 4(a) hereof within the first 5 business days following the Date of Termination, and the amount described in paragraph (iii) of Section 4(a) within the first 5 business days after the Date of Termination.
Not Specified Employee
     5. .
Welfare Benefit Plans
     (a) If a Change in Control of the Company occurs and within three years thereafter your employment with the Company is terminated either by you for Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause, then, in all cases subject to Sections 5(b) and 5(c), the Company shall maintain in full force and effect, for the continued benefit of you and your dependents for three years after the Date of Termination, all life insurance, health and accident, disability and other employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements (excluding, however, any tax-qualified and nonqualified retirement plan or program of the Company), in which you were entitled to participate immediately prior to the Date of Termination; provided that your continued participation is possible under the general terms and provisions of such welfare plans, programs and arrangements. In the event that your participation in any such welfare plan, program or arrangement is barred, or any such plan program or arrangement is discontinued or the benefits thereunder materially reduced, the Company shall arrange to provide you with benefits substantially similar to those which you were entitled to receive under such plans, programs and arrangements immediately prior to the Date of Termination. At the end of the
,
 
period of coverage hereinabove provided for, you shall have the option to have assigned to you at no cost and with no apportionment of prepaid premiums, any assignable insurance owned by the Company and relating specifically to you.
     (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5(a), to the extent that any welfare benefits involve reimbursements or in-kind benefits:
     (i) The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement and the provision of in-kind benefits during any calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of in-kind benefits in any other calendar year;
     (ii) The reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred; and
     (iii) The right to reimbursement or right to in-kind benefit shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
     (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5(a), if at the Date of Termination you are a Specified Employee, no benefits shall be provided hereunder prior to the first day that is 6 months after the Date of Termination; provided that the Specified Employee 6-month delay under this Section 5(c) shall be effective only to the extent that benefits would constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A. Any benefits subject to the Specified Employee 6-month delay shall commence within the first 5 business days after the expiration of such six-month delay. Any benefits that are not "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A or not subject to the Specified Employee six-month delay shall commence within the first business day after the Date of Termination.
     6. . If a Change in Control of the Company occurs and within three years thereafter your employment with the Company is terminated either by you for Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause, then the Company shall provide you reasonable outplacement services for a period of up to one year of a nature customarily provided at your executive officer level.
Outplacement Services
     7. . You shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in Section 4 or 5 by seeking other employment or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, benefits otherwise receivable under Section 5 of this Agreement shall be reduced to the extent that and for any period during which you receive substantially similar benefits from another employer.
No Mitigation Required
     8. . If a Change in Control of the Company occurs and within three years thereafter your employment with the Company is terminated either by you for
Noncompetition
 
Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause, and you are receiving payments from the Company pursuant to this Agreement, then for a period of one year from the Date of Termination of your employment you agree not to, without the written consent of the Company, either directly or indirectly, engage in, make any investment in, advise, assist or render any services to any person or entity in competition with the business of the Company or its subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may own less than one percent of the combined voting power of all issued and outstanding voting securities of any publicly held corporation whose stock is traded on a major stock exchange or quoted on NASDAQ.
     9. . You hereby agree that you shall not at any time (whether employed by the Company or not), either directly or indirectly, disclose or make known to any person or entity any confidential information, trade secret, or proprietary information that you acquired during the course of your employment with the Company which shall not have become public knowledge (other than by your actions in violation of this Agreement). You further agree that upon the termination of your employment with the Company or at any time upon the request of the Company you shall deliver to the Company any and all literature, documents, correspondence, and other materials and records furnished to or acquired by you from the Company during the course of your employment with the Company. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 9 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to you under this Agreement.
Confidential Information
     10. .
Additional Payments
     (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event it is determined (as hereafter provided) that any payment or distribution to or for your benefit, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement or similar right (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto), or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then you shall be entitled to receive an additional payment or payments (a "Gross-Up Payment") in an amount such that, after payment by you of all taxes (including federal, state, and local taxes and any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes and including any Excise Tax) imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, you retain (or have withheld and credited on your behalf for tax purposes) an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payments.
     (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 10(e) hereof, all determinations required to be made under this Section 10, (including whether an Excise Tax is payable by the Executive, the amount of such Excise Tax, whether a Gross-Up Payment is required, and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment) shall be made by
 
a nationally-recognized legal or accounting firm (the "Firm") selected by you in your sole discretion. You agree to direct the Firm to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company within 15 calendar days after the Date of Termination, if applicable, or such earlier time or times as may be requested by you or the Company. If the Firm determines that any Excise Tax is payable by you and that a Gross-Up Payment is required, the Company shall pay you the required Gross-Up Payment within five business days after receipt of such determination and calculations; provided that in no event shall payment be made later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you remit the Excise Tax. If the Firm determines that no Excise Tax is payable by you, it shall, at the same time as it makes such determination, furnish you with an opinion that you have substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on your federal income tax return. Any determination by the Firm as to the amount of the Gross-Up Payment shall be binding upon you and the Company. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto) at the time of the initial determination by the Firm hereunder, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by the Company should have been made (an "Underpayment"). In the event that the Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 10(e) hereof and you thereafter are required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, you may direct the Firm to determine the amount of the Underpayment (if any) that has occurred and to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both you and the Company as promptly as possible. Any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to you, or for your benefit, within five business days after receipt of such determination and calculations; provided that in no event shall such payment be made later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you remit the Underpayment of Excise Tax.
     (c) You and the Company shall each provide the Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the possession of the Company or you, as the case may be, reasonably requested by the Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determination contemplated by Section 10(b) hereof.
     (d) The fees and expenses of the Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by Section 10(b) hereof shall be borne by the Company. If such fees and expenses are initially paid by you, the Company shall reimburse you the full amount of such fees and expenses within five business days after receipt from you of a statement therefor and reasonable evidence of your payment thereof. The payment or reimbursement of the Firm's fees and expenses shall be subject to the following conditions:
     (i) The amount eligible for reimbursement and the provision of in-kind benefits during any calendar year shall not affect the amount eligible
 
for reimbursement or the provision of in-kind benefits in any other calendar year;
     (ii) The reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred; and
     (iii) The right to reimbursement or right to in-kind benefit shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
     (e) You agree to notify the Company in writing of any claim by the Internal Revenue Service that, if successful, would require the payment by the Company of a Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as promptly as practicable but no later than ten business days after you actually receive notice of such claim. You agree to further apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid (in each case, to the extent known by you). You agree not to pay such claim prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the 30-calendar-day period following the date on which you give such notice to the Company and (ii) the date that any payment or amount with respect to such claim is due. If the Company notifies you in writing at least five business days prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim, you agree to:
     (i) provide the Company with any written records or documents in your possession relating to such claim reasonably requested by the Company,
     (ii) take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including without limitation accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney competent in respect of the subject matter and reasonably selected by the Company,
     (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim, and
     (iv) permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, for and against any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 10(e), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with the contest of any claim contemplated by this Section 10(e) and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and
 
all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim (provided, however, that you may participate therein at your own cost and expense) and may, at its option, either direct you to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and you agree to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs you to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Company shall advance the amount of such payment to you on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold you harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance; and provided further, however, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for your taxable year with respect to which the contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of any such contested claim shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable hereunder and you shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. In all cases of the Company's payment or reimbursement of expenses, Excise Tax, or other payment hereunder:
(A) The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement and the provision of in-kind benefits during any calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of in-kind benefits in any other calendar year;
(B) The reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred, the tax paid, the audit is completed, or there is a final and non-appealable settlement or other resolution of litigation, as applicable; and
(C) The right to reimbursement or right to in-kind benefit shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
     (f) If, after the receipt by you of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 10(e) hereof, you receive any refund with respect to such claim, you agree (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 10(e) hereof) to promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after any taxes applicable thereto). If,
 
after your receipt of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 10(e) hereof, a determination is made that you are not entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify you in writing of its intent to contest such denial of refund prior to the expiration of 30 calendar days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid and the amount of such advance shall offset, to the extent thereof, the amount of Gross-Up Payment required to be paid pursuant to this Section 10.
     (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 10, if at the Date of Termination you are a Specified Employee, no payment or reimbursement shall be provided under Section 10 prior to the first day that is 6 months after the Date of Termination; provided that the Specified Employee 6-month delay under this Section 10(g) shall be effective only to the extent that payment or reimbursement would constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A. Any payment or reimbursement otherwise due under this Section 10 and subject to the Specified Employee 6-month delay shall be within the first 5 business days after the expiration of such 6-month delay. Any payment or reimbursement that is not "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A or not subject to the Specified Employee 6-month delay shall be paid or reimbursed as otherwise provided herein.
     11. . To secure payment of the benefits herein provided for, the Company agrees to maintain in the Company's name an irrevocable escrow account in the form of an unfunded rabbi trust (the "Escrow Account") at a national bank that is (a) a legal business entity organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, in good standing, having an office in the State of Ohio, that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and that has at the time of its appointment a combined capital and surplus of at least One Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000) or (b) an affiliate of a national bank described in clause (a) of this sentence (the "Bank"), and to keep on deposit in the Escrow Account such amount, if any, as shall at all times be at least equal to the required security hereinafter provided for. The maximum amount of required security to be kept on deposit at any time shall be (A) an amount equal to three times your annualized Base Compensation (defined as your annual base salary and your target annual incentive compensation (based on achievement of performance goals at the 100% level), with such amount to be recalculated each November to reflect changes in your annualized Base Compensation, or (B) if there has been a determination with your written consent or by a final arbitral award rendered in accordance with this Agreement that a specific lesser amount fully secures the Company's obligations under this Agreement, or that the Company has fully performed its obligations under this Agreement, then such specific lesser amount or, in the case that the Company has fully performed its obligations under this Agreement, nothing. The full maximum amount of required security shall be kept on deposit at all times after there shall have been a Change in Control of the Company.

Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession that constitutes a Change in Control shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle you to compensation from the Company, upon a termination by you for Other Good Reason in accordance with Section 3(e)(B), in the same amount and on the same terms as you would be entitled hereunder under Section 4. As used in this Agreement "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 12 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.

No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and you with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except to the extent a specific compensation program provides for benefits upon a Change in Control relative to that program, which provisions shall remain in effect, no agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement supersedes and replaces in its entirety any prior agreement relating to the subject matter hereof.

Legal Fees and Expenses
     (a) It is the intent of the Company that you shall not be required to incur the expenses associated with the enforcement of your rights under this Agreement by arbitration, litigation, other legal action or negotiation to resolve any disputes because the cost and expenses thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to you hereunder. Accordingly, if it should appear to you that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event the Company or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any arbitration or litigation designed to deny, or to recover from, you the benefits intended to be
 
provided to you hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes you from time to time to retain counsel of your choice, at the expense of the Company, to represent you in connection with the initiation or defense of any arbitration, litigation, other legal action or negotiation to resolve any disputes whether by or against the Company or any director, officer, shareholder or other person affiliated with the Company, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client relationship between the Company and such counsel, the Company irrevocably consents to your entering into an attorney-client relationship with such counsel, and in that connection the Company and you agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between you and such counsel. The Company shall also pay or cause to be paid and shall be solely responsible for any and all attorneys' and related fees and expenses incurred by you as a result of the Company's failure to perform this Agreement or any provision hereof (including this Section 19) or as a result of the Company or any person contesting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
     (b) The payment or reimbursement of fees and expenses under this Section 19 shall be subject to the following conditions:
     (i) You must incur any expense authorized by this Section 19 no later than three years after the Date of Termination;
     (ii) The amount eligible for reimbursement and the provision of in-kind benefits during any calendar year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or the provision of in-kind benefits in any other calendar year;
     (iii) The reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred; and
     (iv) The right to reimbursement or right to in-kind benefit shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
     (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 19, if at the Date of Termination you are a Specified Employee, no payment or reimbursement shall be provided under Section 19 prior to the first day that is six months after the Date of Termination; provided that the Specified Employee six-month delay under this Section 19 shall be effective only to the extent that payment or reimbursement would constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A. Any payment or reimbursement otherwise due under this Section 19 and subject to the Specified Employee six-month delay shall commence within the first five business days after the expiration of such six-month delay. Any payment or reimbursement that is not "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A or not subject
 
to the Specified Employee six-month delay shall be paid or reimbursed as otherwise provided herein.
     20. . No benefit under this Agreement shall at any time be subject in any manner to alienation or encumbrance. If you attempt to, or shall, alienate or in any way encumber your rights or benefits under the Agreement, or any part thereof, or if by reason of his bankruptcy or other event happening at any time any such benefits would otherwise be received by anyone else or would not be enjoyed by you, your interest in all such benefits shall automatically terminate and the same shall be held or applied to or for the benefit of such person, his spouse, children, or other dependents as the Company may select.
Non-Alienation
     21. . The Company (or any agent of the Company) shall report all income required to be reported, and withhold from any payment under the Agreement the amount of withholding taxes due, in the opinion of the Company, in respect of such income or payment and shall take any other action as may be necessary, in the opinion of the Company, to satisfy all obligations for the reporting of such income and payment of such taxes. Except as specifically provided herein, the Company shall not be held liable for any taxes, penalties, interest, or other monetary amounts owed by a Participant or other person, including any taxes, penalties, and/or interest under Section 409A, as a result of the payment or deferral of any amounts under the Agreement. Although the Company shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, penalties, and/or interest under Section 409A, tax treatment of payment under this Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed.
Taxes
     22. This Agreement is intended to be treated as an unfunded deferred compensation arrangement under the Code. The obligation of the Company shall constitute the unsecured promise of the Company to make payments as provided herein, and no person shall have any interest in, or a lien or prior claim upon, any property of the Company.

(c) The limitations of this Section 13.4 will not apply to (i) fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Parent or Sellers with respect to of any of Sellers' representations and warranties under this Agreement or to any intentional breach by Sellers of any covenant or obligation hereunder or (ii) failure by Buyer to pay the Purchase Price as and when due.
13.5 .
Indemnification Procedure
(a) Upon the occurrence of any event that a party asserts to be the basis for a claim for indemnification against the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Section (a "Claim"), then the party to be indemnified (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly give notice (a "Claim Notice") to the Indemnifying Party thereof in writing, provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this Agreement except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced.
 
(b) If the Claim involves the claim of any third party, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes (unless the Indemnifying Party is also a party to such Proceeding and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate) to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section 13 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other than reasonable costs of investigation. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Proceeding, (i) no compromise or settlement of such claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnified Party's consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party; and (ii) the Indemnified Party will have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the Indemnifying Party does not, within ten (10) business days after the Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of such Proceeding, subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to assume the defense of such Proceedings at a later date, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise, or settle such Proceeding, and the Indemnifying Party will be bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement effected.
(c) If the Indemnified Party provides a Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a third-party claim, the Indemnifying Party may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim for indemnification set forth in such Claim Notice (a "Dispute Notice"). If, with respect to the claim for indemnification set forth in a Claim Notice, no Dispute Notice is given to the Indemnified Party within such thirty (30) day period, the Claim shall be deemed valid, and the Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay to the Indemnified Party the amount specified in the Claim Notice with respect to such Claim. If a Dispute Notice is given to the Indemnified Party, the dispute that is the subject of such notice shall be resolved as follows: the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through a good faith discussion of the Claim. If such discussion does not result in a resolution acceptable to either the Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party, either party may resort to any remedies available in law or in equity in a court of competent jurisdiction subject to Section 20.
 
(d) Upon the Closing, Sellers shall obtain and deliver to Buyer a Guaranty made by Wilmington Investments, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("WII"), in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "Wilmington Guaranty"), by which WII shall unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee to Buyer the prompt and complete payment and performance of the obligations of Sellers under Section 3.3 and Section 13.1.

(d) By Buyer, if the Sellers have breached any of the representations and warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement which breach (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Sections 8.1 or 8.5 or (ii) is either incapable of being cured by the Sellers, or, if curable, is not cured within the Buyer's sole discretion within 30 days of receipt from Buyer of notice thereof;
(e) by Buyer providing written notice to Sellers following the delivery by Sellers to Buyer of amended schedules pursuant to Section 6.4, so long as (i) the development that is the subject of the amendment to the Schedules has, had or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Business, (ii) Buyer has provided the Sellers with written notice of its intent to terminate the Agreement in accordance with Section 6.4 within 10 business days of the delivery by Sellers to Buyer of the amended Schedules, and (iii) the matter, condition or occurrence described in such amendment to the Schedules causing a reasonable expectation of a material adverse effect has continued without cure for a period of 30 days after such notice; and
(f) by either Sellers or Buyer if any court or other governmental authority has issued, enforced or entered any final and non-appealable order that is in effect and prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, so long as the existence of the order is not due to a breach of this Agreement by the terminating part.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported sales and earnings for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2008 year ended June 30. Fiscal 2008 sales increased 3.7% to a record $2,089,456,000 from $2,014,109,000 in fiscal 2007. Net income for the year also established a new high as it rose 11% to $95,456,000 versus $86,022,000 in the previous year. Earnings per share increased 13.5% to $2.19 compared with $1.93 last year.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, August 8, 2008
Net sales for the fourth quarter increased slightly to $529,745,000 from $528,025,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $24,437,000 compared with $24,640,000 last year. The prior year quarter benefited from nonrecurring year end adjustments for self-insurance reserves. Fiscal 2008 fourth quarter earnings per share were $0.57 compared with $0.56 last year.
Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, We are pleased with our fiscal 2008 performance having hit our sixth consecutive year of record sales and earnings. Our active management of inventory and other assets, productivity improvements, and implementation of cost controls have again yielded strong financial results.
While our financial performance was strong, we definitely saw the effect of a slowing economy during the second half of our fiscal year with only half of our top thirty industries showing positive growth. Our sales to the forest products industry and the transportation industry, historically strong markets for us, were especially soft.
 
Our operating margin continued to show strength, as we achieved 7.3% for both our fourth quarter and our full year. We also enjoyed significant cash flow, ending the year with $101,830,000 in cash, giving us a strong balance sheet with which to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities. In the second half of our fiscal year, we strengthened our presence in Mexico with the acquisitions of VYCMEX and Suministros Industriales Enol. While these acquisitions had little impact on our 2008 sales and earnings, they will provide a nice boost going forward. Additionally, we recently reached an agreement to acquire Fluid Power Resource (FPR) and seven of its fluid power distribution businesses in the United States.
Looking ahead to fiscal 2009, we expect certain segments of the economy to remain soft. We believe we will achieve earnings of $2.20 to $2.40 per share on sales of $2.13 to $2.24 billion. This guidance does not include any amounts from the pending acquisition of FPR.
During 2008, the Company purchased 1,144,900 shares of the Companys common stock on the open market for approximately $33,224,000. No shares were purchased during the fourth quarter. At June 30, 2008, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 1,065,000 additional shares.
Applied will host its fourth quarter conference call for investors and analysts at 3 p.m. today. To join in the call, dial 1-888-581-9259, passcode 54843171.

Cleveland, OH, August 29, 2008

Exhibit 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported first quarter sales and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2008.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, October 27, 2008
Net sales for the first quarter increased 4.9% to $543,906,000 from $518,547,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Same store sales in the United States were slightly down primarily due to weak housing and automotive markets. These decreases were offset by sales increases from recent acquisitions and by growth in its Canadian business.
Net income for the quarter was $22,536,000 or $0.52 per share compared to $24,457,000 or $0.56 per share last year. Current period costs were increased by interest expense and amortization of intangibles related to recent acquisitions. Gross margins were slightly lower as a result of the on-going challenges of passing through supplier price increases as well as a mix shift to larger contract business.
"Our sales slowed in the quarter as we saw mixed demand within the industries we serve," stated David L. Pugh, Applied's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Housing related and transportation markets have slowed considerably, while energy related markets have continued to show strength. Primary metals and food production markets are still strong for us as well.
 
"In August we completed the acquisition of Fluid Power Resource (FPR) and seven of its fluid power distribution businesses in the United States, which contributed one month to our quarterly sales," said Mr. Pugh. "We continue to generate significant cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet with which to continue to pursue strategic growth opportunities.
"In response to the challenging and uncertain economic outlook, we feel fiscal 2009 sales and earnings will be less than our original projection," said Mr. Pugh. "We now expect to achieve earnings of $1.90 to $2.15 per share on sales of $2.20 to $2.30 billion." Previously, the Company had forecasted earnings of $2.22 to $2.44 per share on sales of $2.32 to $2.43 billion.
The Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. At September 30, 2008, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 1,065,000 additional shares.
Applied will host its first quarter conference call for investors and analysts at 11:00 a.m. today. To join in the call, dial 1-888-581-9259 (US/Canada) or 1-706-679-2792 (International), ID 67210594. The call will be conducted by Chairman & CEO David L. Pugh, President & COO Benjamin J.

Exhibit 99.1
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements
The Acquired Entities of Fluid Power Resource, LLC Year Ended December 31, 2007 With Report of Independent Auditors
 
 
The Board of Directors and Members The Acquired Entities of Fluid Power Resource, LLC
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of The Acquired Entities of Fluid Power Resource, LLC as of December 31, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, members' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of The Acquired Entities of Fluid Power Resource, LLC at December 31, 2007, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

1. Organization and Nature of Business
Description
The Acquired Entities of Fluid Power Resource, LLC (the Company) is a group of distributors of hydraulic, pneumatic, electronic, and support hardware, that provides services such as product application expertise, project management, and repair. The Company extends credit to customers, substantially all of whom are located near the Company's distribution centers and sales offices, throughout the United States.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of The Acquired Entities of Fluid Power Resource, LLC (the Company or FPR), a Delaware Limited Liability Company, include the accounts of the following wholly owned subsidiaries which were acquired by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. on August 29, 2008: Bay Advanced Technologies, LLC (BAT), Carolina Fluid Components, LLC (CFC), DTS Fluid Power, LLC (DTS), FluidTech, LLC (FT), H.E.B., LLC (HEB), Hughes HiTech, LLC (HHT), Mach V, Inc. (MV), Hydro Air, LLC (HA), and FPR Corporate (Holdings). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, (SFAS 157). This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements, but does not require any new fair value measurements. The standard covers financial assets and liabilities, as well as for any other assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in financial statements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, for financial assets and liabilities, and for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on its financial statements.
Fair Value Measurements
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, (SFAS 159). This statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. This statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement, which is consistent with the FASB's long-term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments. SFAS 159 is effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 159 but does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements.
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an Amendment of SFAS No. 115
 
1. Organization and Nature of Business (continued)
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160 changes the classification of non-controlling (minority) interests on the balance sheet and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such interests. Under the new standard, interests are considered equity and are to be reported as an element of stockholders' equity rather than within the mezzanine or liability sections of the balance sheet. In addition, the current practice of reporting minority interest expense or benefit also will change. Under the new standard, net income will encompass the total income before minority interest expense. The income statement will include separate disclosure of the attribution of income between the controlling and non-controlling interests. Increases and decreases in the non-controlling ownership interest amount are to be accounted for as equity transactions. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and earlier application is prohibited. Upon adoption, the balance sheet and the income statement will be recast retrospectively for the presentation of non-controlling interests. The other accounting provisions of the statement are required to be adopted prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 160.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits and short-term investments that can be easily converted into cash and that have original maturities of three months or less.
Accounts Receivable
The Company records accounts receivable at the time when the criteria for revenue recognition have been satisfied. Collectibility of receivables is periodically assessed by the Company. This assessment provides the basis for the allowance for doubtful accounts and the related bad debt expense. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and generally does not require collateral.
Activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows (in thousands):
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, or market. Cost is determined by the average cost method for substantially all inventory. Market is net realizable value.
Fixed Assets
Machinery and equipment and office furniture are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company provides for depreciation of machinery and equipment and office furniture using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for machinery, warehouse and shop equipment, and office equipment and furniture, and three to five years for computer equipment and vehicles.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Expenses for repairs, maintenance, and renewals are charged to operations as incurred. Expenditures that improve an asset or extend its useful life are capitalized.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with (SFAS 142). Goodwill attributable to each of the Company's operating entities is tested annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of each operating entity with its carrying amount.
FASB SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
In 2007, the Company did not incur any impairment charges.
Recorded goodwill of approximately $29,678,000 relates to excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets, which were acquired during the HEB acquisition.
Intangibles and Other Assets
Intangibles and other assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs and costs associated with employment and non-compete agreements with several former owners of acquired businesses (former owners).
Deferred financing costs relate to the costs of obtaining financing and are amortized using sum-of-the-years digits, which approximates the effective interest rate method. In September 2007 in connection with refinancing its debt obligations, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (see Note 6). In accordance with EITF 96-19, and EITF 98-14, , the Company capitalized $614,000, of debt issuance costs related to the amendments. These costs are being amortized over the remaining life of the amended and restated revolving credit facility. Unamortized costs related to the previous credit agreement were charged to interest expense in the current year.
Debtor's Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments,
Debtor's Accounting for Changes in or Revolving-Debt Arrangements
Line-of-Credit
Costs associated with the employment and non-compete agreements are being amortized on a straight-line basis from five to ten years  in conjunction with the terms of the agreements.
Long-Lived Assets
In accordance with SFAS No. 144, , the Company reviews long-lived assets and related intangibles for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. To date, no such impairment has been indicated. If a review indicates that the carrying amount of these assets would not be recoverable as measured based on estimated undiscounted cash flows over their remaining life, the carrying amount would be adjusted to fair value. The cash flow estimates used contain management's best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections.
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of
Lease Arrangements
The Company conducts its operations from leased facilities and finances certain equipment expenditures through lease agreements. In those cases in which the lease term approximates the useful life of the leased asset or the lease meets certain other prerequisites, the leasing arrangement is classified as a capital lease. The remaining arrangements are treated as operating leases.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Revenue Recognition
Generally, revenues and associated costs are recognized as services are provided, goods are shipped, or when title passes.
Shipping and Handling Costs
All fees billed to the customer for shipping and handling are classified as a component of net sales and were approximately $1,921,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007. All other costs associated with shipping and handling are classified as cost of sales and approximated $3,679,000 for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Significant Vendors and Concentration of Risk
Purchases from two vendors for the year ended December 31, 2007, totaled approximately 23% of consolidated purchases. No other single vendor accounted for more than 10% of purchases in either year. For those vendors that exceeded 10% of purchases, their collective outstanding accounts payable were 22% of total accounts payable as of December 31, 2007.
Financial Instruments
The Company uses a derivative to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. SFAS No. 133, (SFAS 133), as amended, defines derivatives, requires that derivatives be carried at fair value on the balance sheet, and provides for hedge accounting when certain conditions are met. In accordance with SFAS 133, the Company's derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as "cash flow" hedges, to the extent the hedges are highly effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Ineffective portions of cash flow hedges, if any, are recognized in current period earnings. Other comprehensive income is reclassified into current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative used as the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or ceases to be highly effective, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.
The table below summarizes the outstanding interest rate swap designated as a hedge as of December 31, 2007. The variable component of the interest rate swap outstanding was based on LIBOR (London InterBank Offered Rate) in 2007.
 
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is based on the net present value of the future cash flows using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect at the respective year-ends. This amount also represents the recorded amount at the consolidated balance sheet date. The carrying amounts of the Company's borrowings under its credit agreement approximate fair value because it is a variable rate instrument.
Income Taxes
The Company consists of limited liability companies and is, therefore, not a taxpaying entity for federal or state income tax purposes, and thus no income tax expense has been recorded in the accompanying financial statements. Income of the Company is taxed to the members in their respective income tax returns.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
3. Inventories
Inventories as of December 31, 2007, consisted of the following:
The allowance for slow-moving inventory is made based on management's analysis of inventory levels, historical sales activity, and future sales forecasts.
Activity related to the allowance for slow-moving inventory is as follows (in thousands):
 
4. Fixed Assets
Machinery and equipment consisted of the following at December 31, 2007:
Depreciation expense related to fixed assets for the year ended December 31, 2007, approximated $932,000.
5. Intangibles
As of December 31, 2007, the Company's intangible assets consisted of non-compete agreements, deferred financing costs, and a trade name and are summarized as follows (in thousands):
Estimated amortization expense related to intangibles for the next five years is summarized as follows (in thousands):
 
6. Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt at December 31, 2007, consisted of the following:
On September 21, 2007, the Company refinanced its debt obligations and entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (New Agreement) with a syndication of six banks. The New Agreement provides a $55 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $55 million senior secured term loan. Revolver credit facility borrowings are limited by applying a formula to accounts receivable and inventory. The New Agreement includes a $10 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit, and a $5 million sublimit for swingline advances. The Company is permitted to increase maximum borrowings under the revolving facility by up to $15 million.
The New Agreement contains covenants that require the Company to, among other things, maintain minimum financial ratios and provide certain financial reports to the syndication of six banks.
Under the New Agreement, the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at various rate options based on the bank's prime lending rate, LIBOR, and the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to annual consolidated EBITDA, as defined. The term loan is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and is payable in quarterly installments of $1,250,000 through 2013, with the remainder due at that time. At December 31, 2007, the interest rate applicable to the outstanding principal amounts was 7.48%.
The revolving credit facility is used by the Company for general working capital purposes as necessary from time to time and to finance acquisitions. The revolving credit facility expires in 2012. The interest rate applicable to amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility was 7.23% at December 31, 2007. A commitment fee ranging from .25% to .35% of the unused facility is also payable quarterly. At December 31, 2007, approximately $26.2 million was available under the revolving credit facility of which $10.0 million was available for the issuance of letters of credit.
Commitment fees incurred by the Company totaled approximately $76,600 in 2007.
Included in other notes payable and capital lease obligations are certain instruments with terms ranging through April 2011 with interest rates ranging from 6% to 8%.
The New Agreement allows distributions to members necessary to permit the members to make their required quarterly estimated tax payments. Other distributions are permitted after certain leverage and covenant levels are attained as defined in the New Agreement.
 
6. Long-Term Debt (continued)
Aggregate maturities of long-term debt instruments over the next five years are as follows (in thousands):
7. Lease Commitments
The Company leases various corporate offices and distribution warehouses under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases have initial terms of three to ten years with renewal options for an additional three to five years. Rent expense totaled approximately $1,838,000 for 2007.
Future minimum rental commitments for the aforementioned operating leases, including commitments to affiliated entities, over the next five years are as follows (in thousands):
8. Incentive Compensation
The Board of Directors has established a deferred compensation plan for Company executives. The ultimate payment of this plan is dependent on an increase in the enterprise value of the Company and is based upon a percentage of the increase in enterprise value. Payments related to this plan are payable upon sale of the Company, death or total disability of the employee, termination of the employee for a reason other than cause, and employee's attainment of age 65 (however, the Board may specify the attainment of an earlier age). Amounts related to this plan are not significant for 2007.
9. Employee Benefits  401(k) Plans
The Company maintains various voluntary, contributory 401(k) plans for participating employees. Company contributions to the plans, which are made in accordance with the applicable plans, and are based upon various matching formulas and other factors, amounted to approximately $750,000 for 2007.
10. Related-Party Transactions
The Company has executed employment and non-compete agreements with certain former owners of acquired businesses. The agreements provided for base annual salaries, plus bonuses equal to a percentage of the respective LLC's operating income, as defined, in excess of specified bases. The agreements also preclude the former owners from engaging in any businesses that directly or indirectly compete with the LLCs.
 
10. Related-Party Transactions (continued)
An affiliated entity provided management services to the Company. The Company recognized the related management service expense of $1,000,000 for 2007.
11. Subsequent Events
On April 1, 2008, Bay Advanced Technologies, LLC acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of an air and vacuum automation components supplier in Mission Viejo, California, for $1.3 million.
On August 29, 2008, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. acquired substantially all of the assets of the acquired entities (BAT, CFC, DTS, FT, HEB, MV, HHT, HA, and Holdings) of Fluid Power Resources, LLC for an aggregate purchase price of $166 million, including certain assumed liabilities.

Pending New Accounting Standards
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 160 changes the classification of non-controlling (minority) interests on the balance sheet and the accounting for and reporting of transactions between the reporting entity and holders of such non-controlling interests. Under the new standard, interests are considered equity and are to be reported as an element of stockholders' equity rather than within the mezzanine or liability sections of the balance sheet. In addition, the current practice of reporting minority interest expense or benefit also will change. Under the new standard, net income will encompass the total income before minority interest expense. The income statement will include separate disclosure of the attribution of income between the controlling and non-controlling interests. Increases and decreases in the non-controlling ownership interest amount are to be accounted for as equity transactions. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and earlier application is prohibited. Upon adoption, the balance sheet and the income statement will be recast retrospectively for the presentation of non-controlling interests. The other accounting provisions of the statement are required to be adopted prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 160.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in accordance with (SFAS 142). Goodwill attributable to each of the Company's operating entities is tested annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of each operating entity with its carrying amount.
FASB SFAS No. 142,
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
During the six month periods ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, the Company did not incur any impairment charges.
Recorded goodwill of approximately $30.5 million relates to excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets, which were acquired during the HEB and Pacific Air Technology acquisitions.
Intangibles and Other Assets
Intangibles and other assets consist primarily of deferred financing costs and costs associated with employment and non-compete agreements with several former owners of acquired businesses (former owners).
Deferred financing costs relate to the costs of obtaining financing and are amortized using sum-of-the-years digits, which approximates the effective interest rate method. In September 2007 in connection with refinancing its debt obligations, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (see Note 6). In accordance with EITF 96-19, and EITF 98-14, , the Company capitalized $614,000, of debt issuance costs related to the amendments. These costs are being amortized over the remaining life of the amended and restated revolving credit facility. Unamortized costs related to the previous credit agreement were charged to interest expense in the current year.

Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
4. Inventories
Inventories as of June 30, 2008, consisted of the following:
The allowance for slow-moving inventory is made based on management's analysis of inventory levels, historical sales activity, and future sales forecasts.
5. Long-Term Debt
Long-term debt at June 30, 2008, consisted of the following:
On September 21, 2007, the Company refinanced its debt obligations and entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (New Agreement) with a syndication of six banks. The New Agreement provides a $55 million senior secured revolving credit facility and a $55 million senior secured term loan. Revolver credit facility borrowings are limited by applying a formula to accounts receivable and inventory. The New Agreement includes a $10 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit, and a $5 million sublimit for swingline advances. The Company is permitted to increase maximum borrowings under the revolving facility by up to $15 million.
The New Agreement contains covenants that require the Company to, among other things, maintain minimum financial ratios and provide certain financial reports to the syndication of six banks.
Under the New Agreement, the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at various rate options based on the bank's prime lending rate, LIBOR, and the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to annual consolidated EBITDA, as defined. The term loan is secured by substantially all assets of the Company and is payable in quarterly installments of $1,250,000 through 2013, with the remainder due at that time. At June 30, 2008, the interest rate applicable to the outstanding principal amounts was 4.46%.
The revolving credit facility is used by the Company for general working capital purposes as necessary from time to time and to finance acquisitions. The revolving credit facility expires in 2012. The interest rate applicable to amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility was 4.21% at June 30, 2008. A commitment fee ranging from .25% to .35% of the unused facility is also payable quarterly. At June 30, 2008, approximately $27.0 million was available under the revolving credit facility of which $10.0 million was available for the issuance of letters of credit.
 
5. Long-Term Debt (continued)
The New Agreement allows distributions to members necessary to permit the members to make their required quarterly estimated tax payments. Other distributions are permitted after certain leverage and covenants levels are attained as defined in the New Agreement.
6. Acquisition of a Business
On April 1, 2008, Bay Advanced Technologies, LLC (BAT) purchased substantially all of the assets of Pacific Air Technology (PAT), a division of Pacific Air Engineering, Inc. and assumed certain of its operating liabilities for a total cash purchase price of approximately $1.3 million. The purchase price was funded by borrowings from BAT's parent company, Fluid Power Resource, LLC. This acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired approximated $833,000 and has been recorded as goodwill. PAT distributes pneumatic components and compressors throughout the Southern California marketplace.
7. Subsequent Event
On August 29, 2008, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. acquired substantially all of the assets of the acquired entities (BAT, CFC, DTS, FT, HEB, HHT, MV, HA, and Holdings) of Fluid Power Resources, LLC for an aggregate purchase price of $166 million, including certain assumed liabilities.

Exhibit 99.3
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
On August 29, 2008, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc ("Applied") completed its acquisition of certain of the assets of Fluid Power Resource, LLC (the "Seller" or "FPR") including the following fluid power distribution businesses: Bay Advanced Technologies, LLC; Carolina Fluid Components, LLC; DTS Fluid Power, LLC; FluidTech, LLC; Hughes HiTech, LLC; Hydro Air, LLC; H.E.B., LLC and Mach V, Inc.
Applied acquired certain of the assets and specified liabilities of the Seller for an aggregate cash purchase price of $166.0 million. The final purchase price was funded with existing cash of $62.0 million and borrowings of $104.0 million through an established revolving credit facility.
The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is derived from and should be read in conjunction with historical financial statements and related notes of Applied included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2008, and the historical financial statements and related notes of FPR filed as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 herein.
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of June 30, 2008 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended June 30, 2008 are presented herein. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the acquisition as if it occurred on June 30, 2008. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income for the year ended June 30, 2008 gives effect to the acquisition as if it occurred on July 1, 2007 and combines the historical consolidated statement of income of Applied for the year ended June 30, 2008 with the historical consolidated statement of income of FPR for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008. As FPR's fiscal year end is December 31, we derived the FPR statement of income for the twelve months ended June 30, 2008 by using the available financial information.
The historical financial statements have been adjusted to give effect to pro forma items that are (i) directly attributable to the acquisition and (ii) factually supportable. With respect to the statement of income, the pro forma events must be expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results. The pro forma adjustments described in the accompanying notes have been made based on available information and, in the opinion of management, are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined consolidated financial information should not be considered indicative of actual combined results that would have been achieved had the acquisition occurred on the date indicated and do not purport to indicate combined results of operations for any future period.
The acquisition of FPR has been accounted for as a purchase in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, , with intangible assets recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 142, . Accordingly, we have adjusted the historical consolidated financial information to give effect to the cash paid in connection with the acquisition. In the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, Applied's cost to acquire FPR has been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon management's preliminary estimate of their respective fair values. Any excess of the fair value of the amount paid over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been recorded as goodwill. The final purchase price allocation is subject to adjustments based on the final determination of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Therefore, the resulting effect on the combined balance sheet and income from operations may differ from the unaudited pro forma amounts included herein.
Business Combinations
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income does not include any impacts of any revenue, costs or operating synergies that may result from the acquisition or any related restructuring costs.
Based on Applied's review of FPR's summary of significant accounting policies disclosed in the latter's historical financial statements, the nature and amount of any adjustments to the historical financial statements of FPR to conform their accounting policies to those of Applied are not expected to be significant. Upon consummation of the acquisition, further review of FPR's accounting policies and financial statements may result in required revisions to FPR's policies and classifications to conform to Applied's accounting policies.
 
Pro Forma Adjustments
Pro forma retention adjustments give effect to the exclusion of certain activities included in the historical financial statements of FPR that were not acquired by Applied. Pro forma adjustments for the acquisition, as recorded under the purchase method of accounting, represent the adjustments necessary to give effect to the acquisition of FPR as of June 30, 2008 (condensed combined balance sheet) and as of July 1, 2007 (condensed combined statement of income). The adjustments are based upon a preliminary allocation of the purchase price, which is expected to be finalized within one year of the acquisition date.
The pro forma adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet and statement of income are as described below.

Description
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
CLEVELAND, Ohio, January 26, 2009  Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported sales and earnings for its fiscal 2009 second quarter, ended December 31, 2008.
Net sales for the second quarter decreased 1.7% to $502,412,000 compared to $511,008,000 in the same period last year. Net income for the quarter declined 29.5% to $16,194,000, or $0.38 per share compared to $22,967,000 or $0.52 per share last year.
For the six months ended December 31, 2008, sales were $1,046,318,000 compared to $1,029,555,000 in the same period last year. Net income was $38,730,000 or $0.90 per share compared to $47,424,000 or $1.08 per share, last year.
Commenting on the Companys performance, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, The rate of decline in the industrial economy has increased, and its scope has broadened beyond our expectations. Our sales for the quarter, excluding acquisitions, were down 11.9% from prior year. Consumer demand continues to decline, and there are inventory adjustments occurring throughout the supply chain. This is a very difficult business climate, and economic indicators would suggest the market has yet to hit bottom.
We are making appropriate adjustments to our cost structure while maintaining a high level of customer service. Our efforts are focused heavily on asset management to protect the interests of our shareholders as we navigate this increasingly turbulent storm.
Even with these moves, it is obvious that our prior guidance of $1.90 to $2.15 earnings per share on sales of $2.2 to $2.3 billion is unattainable. While it is very difficult to forecast with much certainty in this current climate, we are now projecting our full year earnings per share to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.70 on sales ranging between $1.95 billion and $2.1 billion.
The company is stable and our balance sheet is strong, providing an effective basis to weather the current economic challenge.

Date: April 23, 2009
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
- Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported sales and earnings for its fiscal 2009 third quarter, ended March 31, 2009.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 23, 2009
Net sales for the third quarter decreased 14.8% to $451,647,000 compared to $530,156,000 in the same period last year. Net income for the quarter declined 51% to $11,560,000, or $0.27 per share compared to $23,595,000 or $0.55 per share last year.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2009, sales were $1,497,965,000 a decrease of 4% compared to $1,559,711,000 in the same period last year. Net income declined 29.2% to $50,290,000 compared to $71,019,000 last year. Earnings per share declined 27.8% to $1.17 from $1.62 for the nine months last year.
"Our results contained no surprises given the overall economic climate," said Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh. "Sales generation and margin management will continue to be our greatest challenges for the near term as our customers respond to significant consumer withdrawal and we face increases in the competitive environment as a result.
"In light of this, we have made prudent moves to reduce costs in line with demand with a strong focus on asset management. As a result, our cash generation continues to be strong which puts us in a solid strategic position going forward.
"The future remains difficult to forecast as the economic turmoil continues. At this time, we see no relief in this calendar year. We believe our full-year earnings guidance of $1.30 to $1.70 per share is appropriate. From a sales perspective, we believe we will be at, or close to, the low end of our guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.1 billion.
"The company is stable and our balance sheet is healthy, providing an effective base to weather the current economic challenges. We believe our balanced focus on business fundamentals will protect us in the short term and position us well for the long term."
Applied will host its conference call for investors and analysts at 4 p.m. ET today, Thursday, April 23.

(d) Exhibits.
Exhibit 99.1  Press release of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. dated August 7, 2009.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
Date: August 7, 2009
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported lower sales and earnings for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 year ended June 30, 2009.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, August 7, 2009
Results for the fourth quarter and full year were impacted by a $36.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge which is primarily associated with goodwill from the August 2008 acquisition of Fluid Power Resource.
Fiscal 2009 sales decreased 8.0% to $1.9 billion from $2.1 billion in fiscal 2008. Net income for the year decreased to $42.3 million, or $0.99 per share, versus $95.5 million, or $2.19 per share, in the previous year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impairment charge, net income for fiscal 2009 was $65.3 million, or $1.53 per share.
Net sales for the fourth quarter declined 19.7% to $425.2 million from $529.7 million in the comparable period a year ago. Net loss for the quarter was $8.0 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to net income of $24.4 million, or $0.57 per share, last year. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impairment charge, net income for the fourth quarter was $15.0 million, or $0.35 per share.
On a non-GAAP basis, excluding the impairment charge, operating income for fiscal 2009 and the fourth quarter was $109.1 million, or 5.7% of sales, and $21.9 million, or 5.2% of sales, respectively.
Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "As we expected, our fiscal fourth quarter operating performance reflected the impact of the worsening global recession on our customers, which resulted in significantly lower sales.
"We began making significant adjustments to our cost structure last fall and accelerated our efforts in December with aggressive actions aimed at controlling costs, managing assets, and preserving margins. As a result, and in spite of the difficult economic environment, we generated $81 million in cash from operations in fiscal 2009. We have always managed the business conservatively, focusing on cash generation and maintaining a healthy balance sheet to protect the interests of shareholders. Considering the shape of the economy and much of the U.S. industrial sector, we believe we are protected in the short term and are in a solid strategic position for the long term.
 
"Looking ahead to fiscal 2010, we expect the majority of the markets we serve will remain soft, and we will continue to see competitive pricing pressure. Accordingly, we will continue to take actions to adjust our cost structure and to manage assets. While there is speculation that the general economy will improve over the next 12 months, we have yet to see an upturn in sales trends and therefore will continue to manage conservatively going forward. Given this uncertainty and lack of visibility, we expect earnings per share for fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $0.90 to $1.30, a wider range than typically provided, on expected sales of $1.65 billion to $1.85 billion."
In addition to reporting results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), the Company is also reporting non-GAAP results of operations that excludes the charge for goodwill impairment. This non-GAAP information complements the results provided in accordance with GAAP, and supplies investors with relevant and useful data about the Company's ongoing operations.
Applied will host its conference call for investors and analysts on Friday, August 7, 2009, at 1 p.m. ET. To join the call, dial 1-800-446-2782 or 1-847-413-3235 (for International callers) using passcode 24990347. The call will be conducted by Chairman & CEO David L. Pugh, President & COO Ben J. Mondics, and CFO Mark O. Eisele. The call will also be webcast and can be accessed live online at http://www.applied.com and will be archived there for 14 days. A replay of the teleconference will be available for two weeks at 1-888-843-8996 (passcode 24990347).
Applied will hold its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Tuesday, October 20, 2009, 10 a.m. ET, at its Corporate Headquarters, 1 Applied Plaza (E. 36th & Euclid Avenue), Cleveland, Ohio. August 24, 2009, is the record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting.

(1) Cost of sales for interim financial statements are computed using estimated gross profit percentages which are adjusted throughout the year based upon available information. Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based on periodic physical inventory and the effect of year end inventory quantities on LIFO costs. Reductions in year end inventories during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 resulted in liquidations of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. The effect of these liquidations for the years ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 increased gross profit by $4,419 and $626, net income by $2,693 and $383 and net income per share by $0.06 and $0.01.
(2) During the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the Company performed an interim impairment test, which indicated that goodwill in the fluid power segment was impaired at June 30, 2009. Therefore, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge that decreased operating income by $36,605, net income by $23,000 and net income per share by $0.54.
(3)  During the quarter ended June 30, 2009, the Company reduced income tax expense by $1.3 million due to tax benefits that are not expected to re-occur in fiscal 2010. Additionally, adjustments in the quarter reduced SD&A expenses $3.5 million related to the reversal of prior years' long-term incentive accruals and other items not expected to re-occur. These items combined to increase net income per share by $0.08.
(4) At the end of August 2008, we completed the acquisition of Fluid Power Resource, LLC, including seven fluid power businesses for a cost of $166.9 million. The results of operations have been included in the condensed statements of consolidated income as of the acquisition date. Preliminary purchase accounting allocations, including amounts for goodwill and intangible assets, have been updated to reflect current information in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2009.

Exhibits.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
Date: September 16, 2009
 

EXHIBIT 10.01
Authority
The annual Management Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is established by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (the "Committee") under the 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "2007 LTPP").
Objective
The Plan's objective is to reward eligible participants for their contributions toward the achievement of Applied's fiscal year business goals.
Participation
The Plan's participants are those key employees of Applied who are designated as Plan participants by the Committee.
Plan Goals
The Committee shall establish the Plan's goals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of (i) a merger, a consolidation, an acquisition or divestiture, the issuance or repurchase of a substantial amount of capital stock, a reorganization or restructuring, or any other transaction or series of transactions, or (ii) asset write-downs, or litigation or claim judgments or settlements, or foreign exchange gains or losses, or (iii) changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, or (iv) other extraordinary nonrecurring items, then the Committee, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Plan goals, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be conferred, in such manner as the Committee determines is equitably required by the changes or events.
Eligibility for Awards
If Plan goals are met, to be eligible for an award under the Plan, a participant must comply with the terms and conditions of the 2007 LTPP. In addition, except as provided in the 2007 LTPP, the participant must be actively employed by Applied on the last day of the fiscal year, except that,
 
Plan awards are intended to create an incentive for participants to act in Applied's best interests. Notwithstanding anything in these terms to the contrary,
The provisions of this section are a fundamental term of the award.
Other
The Committee has the authority to construe the Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations, in the Committee's judgment, necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration.
The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency with respect to the Plan in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under these provisions shall be conclusive for all purposes.
The provisions of these terms and conditions are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
The validity, construction, interpretation, and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.

EXHIBIT 10.02
Your Stock Appreciation Rights Award (the "SARs" or the "Award") is made by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Applied"). For purposes of these terms and conditions, employment by a parent, subsidiary, or an affiliate of Applied shall be considered employment by Applied.
The Award is governed by Applied's 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan"), including the policies adopted by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of Applied's Board of Directors (the "Committee") under the Plan, and these terms and conditions. Upon valid exercise, the Award entitles you to receive such number of shares of Applied common stock ("Shares") that have a fair market value equal to the difference (if positive) between the fair market value of (i) a Share on the date of exercise over (ii) the Base Price, multiplied by (iii) the number of Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised, subject to the following conditions:
1. Grant of SARs; Exercisability.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2 and 7, below, your Award will be exercisable only if and after you have remained in Applied's continuous employ from the Award's grant date (the "Grant Date") to the vesting date of all or the specified portion of your Award. Your Award vests with respect to only 25% of the aggregate number of Shares to which it relates after one year of continuous employment from the Grant Date, which percentage increases to 50% after two years, to 75% after three years, and to 100% after four years of continuous employment from the Grant Date.
(b) Your Award shall expire at the end of the 10-year period commencing with the Grant Date (the "Term"), or upon such earlier expiration or separation from service date as may be provided by Sections 2 and 7 below. The SARs shall not be exercisable thereafter.
If, during the Term, you incur a separation from service from Applied for any reason, you may exercise your SARs, to the extent you were entitled to exercise them immediately prior to your separation from service, at any time within three months after your separation from service (but only during the Term); , that (i) if you retire under an Applied retirement plan, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within three years after your retirement (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; (ii) if you incur a separation from service due to your permanent and total disability, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your separation from service (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; and (iii) if you die while employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your death (but only during the Term), the person entitled by will or applicable law to exercise the SARs may do so.
2. Termination of SARs.
provided, however
 
Awards are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests. Notwithstanding anything in these terms to the contrary,
(a) Your Award may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required to immediately repay all Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous six months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending six months following your separation from service, you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, or vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective at the time of your act.
(b) The committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (I) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (II) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (x) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (y) your earnings pursuant to the Award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
The provisions of this section are a fundamental term of the Award.
During your life, your Award may be exercised only by you, your guardian, or legal representative. Upon your death, your Award may be exercised by the person entitled by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
3. Method of Exercise; Rights of Holder.
Your SARs may be exercised by delivering to Applied at its principal executive offices (directed to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Secretary) a written notice (which may include facsimile transmission or electronic mail), signed by you or such other person entitled to exercise the SARs, of the election to exercise the SARs and stating the number of Shares as to which the SARs are being exercised. The SARs shall be deemed exercised as of the date Applied receives the notice. If the SARs are exercised, as provided herein, by any person other than you, the notice shall be accompanied by appropriate evidence of that person's right to exercise the SARs. As a condition to your valid exercise of the SARs, you hereby consent to Applied withholding from the Shares issuable upon exercise (if any), such number of Shares the fair market value of which Applied determines to be equal to the amount required to be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state or local law, including tax withholding requirements. Promptly following the proper exercise of the SARs, Applied shall issue in the name of the person exercising the SARs, a certificate representing the Shares due hereunder. Your SARs may be exercised only with respect to a whole number of Shares, and may not be exercised in fractional amounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and the restrictions on exercise contained in Section 2, if a Change in Control of Applied occurs, then your SARs then outstanding shall become fully exercisable as of the date of the Change in Control.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled under this Award or the Plan, including the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c) below. In the event of the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c), the provisions in Section 7 purporting to terminate your SARS shall not apply and you shall have the option either to exercise your rights under Section 7 or to deem the SARs assumed by the successor within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever is more favorable to you.
As an SAR holder, you shall have absolutely no rights as a shareholder, whether before or after vesting of all or any portion of your Award.
 
Your SARs shall not be exercisable if such exercise or the issuance of Shares pursuant to your Award would violate:
4. Limitations on Exercise.
(a) Any state securities law;
(b) Any registration or other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any stock exchange's listing requirements; or
(c) Any other legal requirement of any governmental authority.
If your exercise of SARs is prevented by the terms of any of the foregoing subsections, and the Term of the SARs expires, then you may, within 30 days after Applied notifies you that your exercise is no longer prevented by this Section 4, exercise the SARs to the extent they would have been exercisable but for the operation of this Section 4.
Furthermore, if a registration statement with respect to Shares issuable upon exercise of the SARs is not in effect or if Applied's counsel otherwise deems it necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible violations of the Act, Applied may require, as a condition to its issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares, the delivery to Applied of a commitment in writing by the person exercising the SARs that (i) at the time of the exercise it is his intention to acquire the Shares for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof; (ii) the person understands that the Shares may be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 issued under the Act; and (iii) any resale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares will be accomplished only in compliance with Rule 144, the Act, or other or subsequent rules and regulations thereunder. Applied may place on the certificates representing the Shares a legend reflecting that commitment and Applied may refuse to permit transfer of the Shares until it has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it that no violation of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would be involved in the transfer.
The Award is not a guaranty of employment or commitment by Applied of continued employment. Nothing in the Award or these terms and conditions alters, limits or restricts any right Applied would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of your employment.
5. No Guaranty of Employment.
The Award is not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, and may not be otherwise disposed of by you, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or with the prior written consent of Applied.
6. Nonassignability.
If (i) Applied is to be merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity so that Applied is not the surviving corporation and, immediately after such event, the holders of Shares immediately prior to the event hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity, (ii) Applied is to be dissolved or liquidated, or (iii) substantially all of Applied's assets are to be sold, then the Committee shall give you 30 days' prior written notice. Upon the giving of that notice, if you are employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully vested and exercisable. Within the 30-day period (but only during the Term), you shall have the right to exercise your SARs. Thereafter, notwithstanding any other provision of these terms and conditions, the SARs shall expire, unless "assumed" by another corporation within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
7. Liquidation, Dissolution, Merger, Sale of Substantially All Assets.
In the event (i) of a stock dividend or stock split or (ii) the Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the Shares purchasable or the Base Price hereunder shall be equitably adjusted so that the SARs represent the right to acquire Shares or the number and kind of other securities that are economically equivalent to what the Shares would have represented had the SARs been fully exercised immediately preceding such event.
8. Adjustments.
 
In the event other changes or events relating to the Shares fundamentally change the value of the Shares or securities for which the SARs are exercisable, then the Committee may make, in its sole discretion, such adjustments in the terms of the SARs as the Committee may determine is equitably required by the change or event.
The Committee shall have authority, subject to the Plan's express provisions, to construe these terms and conditions and the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the Committee's judgment necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or these terms and conditions in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under this Section shall be conclusive for all purposes.
9. Committee Authority.
In the event of any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and any provision of the Plan or the Committee's policies, the Plan or the policies shall govern. Terms used but not otherwise defined in these terms and conditions shall have the meaning ascribed them in the Plan. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, these terms and conditions and the SARs granted shall be subject to all of the Plan's provisions in effect from time to time, which are incorporated herein by reference.
10. Relationship to the Plan.
The provisions of these terms and conditions are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
11. Severability.
.  The validity, construction, interpretation and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.

Applicable Law.

EXHIBIT 10.03
. The Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied") on the Grant Date awarded you a certain number of restricted stock units (the "RSUs"). Such award represents your right to receive an equal number of shares of Applied common stock ("Shares"), issuable from Applied's available treasury shares, upon the expiration of the Restriction Period (as defined in Section 3 hereof). The terms and conditions of the RSUs as set forth herein (the "Terms") together with the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan") govern your rights with respect to the RSUs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the Terms, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. Moreover, it should be noted that unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized words in the Terms shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Plan.
1. Award of Restricted Stock Units
. You shall not have the right to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber or dispose of the RSUs until all conditions with respect to vesting and distribution have been met. Nevertheless, during the Restriction Period and so long as no forfeiture has occurred, you shall be entitled to receive cash payments equal to the dividends and cash distributions paid on Shares underlying the RSUs ("Dividend Equivalents") to the same extent and on the same date as if each RSU were a Share; provided, however, that no Dividend Equivalents shall be payable to you with respect to dividends or distributions the record date for which occurs on or after (i) the date on which a forfeiture of the RSUs has occurred, (ii) the date on which the Restriction Period has expired, or (iii) the date on which issuance of Shares to you has occurred. You shall not have voting rights with respect to the RSUs and, until the issuance of Shares in settlement of the RSUs, you shall not be treated as a shareholder with respect to the Shares.
2. Rights during Restriction Period
. The term "Restriction Period" means the period from the Grant Date until the 3 anniversary of the Grant Date.
3. Restriction Period
rd
. Except as specifically provided otherwise in Sections 5 and 6, you will be 100% vested in the RSUs as of the end of the Restriction Period; provided, however, that in the event you incur a Separation from Service during the Restriction Period after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, you will be vested at the end of the Restriction Period in a pro rata portion of the RSUs equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the number of fiscal quarters (including a portion of a quarter) elapsed in the Restriction Period prior to the date of such Separation from Service and the denominator of which is twelve.
4. Vesting
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, but subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) hereunder, if, during the Restriction Period, you incur a Separation from Service (as defined in Section 409A) from Applied due to death or Disability (as defined under Section 409A) then (i) you (or your beneficiary designated to Applied in writing) shall be vested in a pro rata portion of the RSUs equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the number of fiscal quarters (including a portion of a quarter) elapsed in the Restriction Period prior to the date of such Separation from Service and the denominator of which is twelve, and (ii) the remaining RSUs shall be deemed forfeited. In the event, however, that you, during the Restriction Period, incur a Separation from Service from Applied for any reason other than (i) those specifically set forth above or in Section 6, or (ii) termination after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, then the entire award of RSUs shall be forfeited and no amount shall be due or payable to you under the Terms. Because awards of RSUs are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests, notwithstanding anything in the Terms to the contrary:
5. Separation from Service
(a) Your award of RSUs may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends, distributions, and Dividend Equivalents thereon) issued pursuant to the award of RSUs hereunder within the previous six months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending six months following the your Separation from Service, you committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers, or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, or vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective as of the time of your act.
 
(b) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends, distributions, and Dividend Equivalents thereon) issued pursuant to the award of RSUs hereunder within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (I) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (II) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (x) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (y) your earnings pursuant to the award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, upon the occurrence of any Change in Control (as defined under Section 409A) during the Restriction Period, all of the RSUs awarded hereunder to you shall be 100% vested.
6. Change in Control
. In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, exchange, spin-off, spin-out, or other distribution of assets to shareholders, or other similar event or change in capitalization such that shares of Applied common stock are changed into or become exchangeable for a different number of shares, thereafter the number of RSUs will be increased or decreased, as the case may be, in direct proportion to the increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock by reason of such change in corporate structure; provided, however, that the number of RSUs shall always be a whole number. If there occurs any other change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of common stock or other Applied securities, or of any shares of stock or other securities into which such shares of common stock shall have been changed or for which they shall have been exchanged, then Applied may adjust the number or kind of RSUs or other securities into which the RSUs may be settled, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine is equitable, and such adjustment so made shall be effective and binding for all purposes.
7. Adjustment of RSUs for Certain Events
. Your award of RSUs hereunder shall be settled in whole Shares. Fractional Shares shall not be issuable hereunder and any fractional Share shall be disregarded. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Section 8, Shares subject to an award of RSUs hereunder shall only be issued and distributed to you in a single sum of whole Shares within the 75-day period after the end of the Restriction Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that your RSUs become vested due to death, Disability or a Change in Control, the award of RSUs hereunder shall be settled in a single sum of whole Shares within the 75-day period after such vesting. In the event that any such 75-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, you (or your beneficiary as the case may be) shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Moreover, notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution of Shares may not be made until within the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following the month of any Separation from Service for reasons other than Disability or a Change in Control, or, if earlier, your death, except as maybe otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
8. Settlement of Award and Distribution of Shares
. Upon (or immediately prior to) the vesting of the RSUs, you will be required to pay to Applied, or make arrangements satisfactory to the Committee regarding payment of, any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by Applied attributable to the award of the RSUs hereunder.
9. Payment of Taxes
. To the extent applicable, it is intended the Terms and the award of RSUs shall comply with or be exempt from the provisions of Section 409A and any interpretations of these terms shall be consistent with such intent.
10. Section 409A Compliance
 
. The Committee shall have conclusive authority, subject to the express provisions of the Plan as in effect from time to time and the Terms, to construe the Terms and the Plan, and to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Terms in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect, and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. Applied's Board of Directors (the "Board") may from time to time grant to the Committee such further powers and authority as the Board shall determine to be necessary or desirable. Notwithstanding any other provision of these terms, any amendment, construction, establishment, rescission or correction of the type referred to above which is made or adopted following a Change in Control, and which amendment, construction, establishment or correction adversely affects your rights hereunder, shall be in writing and shall be effective only with your express and prior written consent .
11. Administration of the Plan
. The Terms is subject to the terms of the Plan and any administrative policies adopted by the Committee. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms and the Plan or such policies, the Plan and the policies, in that order, shall govern. References in the Terms to Applied shall include Applied's subsidiaries.
12. Relationship to the Plan
. The provisions of the Terms are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
13. Severability
. The Terms and your award shall not confer upon you any rights whatsoever other than those expressly set forth herein, in the Plan or in policies adopted by the Committee. Nothing in the Terms shall (i) interfere with or limit in any way Applied's right to terminate your employment at any time, (ii) confer upon you any right to continued employment with Applied, or (iii) create any contractual or other right to receive additional awards or other Plan benefits in the future.
14. No Guarantee of Employment
. The granting of the RSUs hereunder shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agency, national securities exchange, or automated quotation system may be required. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Terms, Applied shall not be obligated to issue, deliver or transfer any Shares, make any distribution of benefits under the Plan or the Terms, or take any other action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, the requirements of the Securities Act and Section 409A).
15. Requirements of Law
. All obligations of Applied under the Terms with respect to the RSUs shall be binding upon any successor to Applied, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all, or substantially all, of the business and/or assets of Applied. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, in the event any such successor does not agree to be bound by the Terms, the RSUs granted hereunder shall immediately become vested.
16. Successors
. The validity, construction, interpretation and enforceability of these Terms shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
17. Applicable Law
(September 2009)

EXHIBIT 10.04
. The Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied") may award Performance Shares (the "Award") to key senior officers of Applied who have broad policy-making functions and who directly contribute to the long-term success and profitability of Applied. The Committee has awarded you an Award with an Effective Date. The terms and conditions are set forth herein (the "Terms") and together with the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan") govern your rights with respect to the Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the Terms, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. Moreover, it should be noted that unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized words in the Terms shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Plan.
1. Award of Performance Shares
. You shall not have the right to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber your Award until all conditions with respect to vesting and distribution have been met. Nevertheless, after the first anniversary of the Effective Date and so long as no forfeiture has occurred, you shall be entitled to receive cash payments equal to the dividends and cash distributions paid on the Shares underlying the Award ("Dividend Equivalents") to the same extent and on the same date as if the Shares, if any, attributable to your Award had been payable to you; provided, however, that no Dividend Equivalents shall be payable to you with respect to dividends or distributions for which the record date occurs on or after (i) the date on which forfeiture of the Award has occurred; (ii) the date on which the Performance Period has expired; or (iii) the date on which the issuance of shares of Applied common stock ("Shares") to you in settlement of your Award has occurred. Until the issuance of Shares in settlement of your Award has occurred, you shall not be treated as a shareholder with respect to the Shares.
2. Rights during Performance Period
. The term "Performance Period" shall mean, for purposes of the Terms, the period from the Effective Date until the third year anniversary of the Effective Date.
3. Performance Period
. Subject to the provisions of Section 6, your Award will be 100% vested at the end of the Performance Period, in whole or in part based upon the achievement of the performance goals set by the Committee.
4. Vesting
. If, during the Performance Period, you incur a Separation from Service (as defined in Section 409A) from Applied due to death or Disability (as defined in Section 409A), then, promptly following the availability of audited financial statements for the final year of the Performance Period, you (or your beneficiary whom you have designated to Applied in writing) shall be entitled to receive a pro rata payment under the Award equal to (i) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of fiscal quarters (including a portion of a quarter) elapsed in the Performance Period prior to the date of your Separation from Service and the denominator of which is twelve, multiplied by (ii) what would have been your Award for the Performance Period based on the actual achievement of the performance goals, if you had not incurred a Separation from Service during the Performance Period. In the event, however, that during the Performance Period, you incur a Separation from Service from Applied for any reason other than (i) those specifically set forth above or in Section 6 hereof, or (ii) termination after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, then your Award will be forfeited and no amount shall be due or payable to you pursuant to the Award. In addition, if, during the Performance Period, you cease to be a Board-elected executive officer of Applied (but remain an employee of Applied), then your Award shall be forfeited and no amount shall be due or payable to you pursuant to the Award. Since Awards are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests, notwithstanding anything in the Terms to the contrary:
5. Separation from Service or Termination of Executive Officer Status
(a) Your Award may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous six months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending six months following your Separation from Service, you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, and vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective at the time of your act.
 
(b) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (I) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (II) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (x) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (y) your earnings pursuant to the Award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined under Section 409A) during the Performance Period, you shall be 100% vested and entitled to receive a pro rata amount of Shares under the Award equal to (i) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of fiscal quarters (including a portion of a quarter) elapsed in the Performance Period prior to the date of the Change in Control and the denominator of which is twelve, multiplied by (ii) your target award amount.

Exhibit 99.1  Press release of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. dated October 20, 2009.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
Date: October 20, 2009
 

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported first quarter 2010 sales and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2009.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, October 20, 2009
Net sales for the first quarter decreased 19.5% to $437,743,000 from $543,906,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $11,187,000 or $0.26 per share compared to $22,536,000 or $0.52 per share last year.
"Our sales, while significantly lower than those of the same period in the prior year, were slightly ahead of our fourth quarter 2009 results. We feel this shows a stabilization in what had been a steadily declining pace," said David L. Pugh, Applied's Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. "While a portion of this might be attributed to federal stimulus spending, we are hopeful we have found a bottom to the recession. The rate of recovery is still undefined.
"We continue to manage the fundamentals well. While gross margins experienced mild degradation under heightened competitive price pressure in the marketplace, our asset management was excellent in both inventory and receivables. Our cost control processes are actively helping us identify a wide variety of improvement opportunities that are consistent with changes in our level of activity and customer base.
"We expect that our sales volume will continue close to its current rate, at least through our second quarter. Our focus will be on improving earnings with this reduced sales volume. For the full fiscal year 2010, we still expect to achieve earnings of $0.90 to $1.30 per share on sales of $1.65 to $1.85 billion."
 
The Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. At September 30, 2009, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 997,100 additional shares.
The Company will host its quarterly conference call for investors and analysts at 4 p.m. ET on October 20, 2009. To join the call, dial 1-800-697-5978 or 1-630-691-2750 (for International callers) using passcode 8983558. The call will be conducted by Chairman & CEO David Pugh, President & COO Benjamin Mondics, and CFO Mark Eisele. A live audio webcast can be accessed online at www.Applied.com. A replay of the call will be available for two weeks by dialing 1-888-843-8996 or 1-630-652-3044 (International) using passcode 8983558.

This press release contains statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "expect," "believe", "will," and similar expressions. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Applied assumes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, or events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

(1) The Company uses the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can be made only at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination. The Company is estimating reductions in certain U.S. inventories during fiscal 2010 which would result in the liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years.
The Company recorded LIFO income of $700 thousand during the quarter ended September 30, 2009 which reduced the overall LIFO reserve by the same amount. The effect of LIFO layer liquidations during the current quarter increased gross profit by $4.3 million. There were no comparable LIFO layer liquidations recorded for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported sales and earnings for its fiscal 2010 second quarter, ended December 31, 2009.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, January 20, 2010
Net sales for the second quarter decreased 11% to $446,253,000 compared to $502,412,000 in the same period last year. Net income for the quarter was $10,487,000 or $0.24 per share compared to $16,194,000 or $0.38 per share last year.
For the six months ended December 31, 2009, sales were $883,996,000 compared to $1,046,318,000 in the same period last year. Net income was $21,674,000 or $0.51 per share compared to $38,730,000 or $0.90 per share, last year.
Commenting on the Company's performance, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "The general market continues to be difficult. While some sectors have shown improvement in activity, there is a concern that it may be a transient response to stimulus initiatives. Other sectors, especially those impacted by new construction, are still declining. Overall, demand is low and tight competition has lead to gross margin pressure. Business activity is consistent with our expectations for a slow, protracted economic recovery.
"Remaining nimble in such an environment is essential. Our efforts remain focused on the underlying fundamentals of our business with an emphasis on tight cost control and conservative asset management. The Company is stable and our cash position is strong and well-positioned for the long-term.
"For fiscal 2010, we now expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.25 on sales of $1.75 billion to $1.85 billion."
The Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. At December 31, 2009, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 997,100 additional shares.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2010 year ended June 30, 2010.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, August 10, 2010
Fiscal 2010 full-year sales were $1,893,208,000, down 1.6% from fiscal 2009 sales of $1,923,148,000. Net income for the year was $65,903,000 or $1.54 per share, compared to $42,260,000 or $0.99 per share in fiscal 2009, an increase in net income of 55.9%. Fiscal 2009 results included a non-cash goodwill impairment charge that reduced earnings by $0.54 per share. The charge was primarily associated with the August 2008 acquisition of Fluid Power Resource.
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $523,071,000, up 23.0% from prior year sales of $425,183,000 for the comparable period. Net income for the quarter was $27,704,000 or $0.64 per share, an improvement of 85% compared to last year's fourth quarter adjusted to remove the impairment charge.
Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "We began fiscal 2010 prepared for a tough industrial market. Our sales growth initiatives and operating disciplines helped us perform well during the first six months of the fiscal year despite ongoing weaknesses in the overall economy. We tightly managed expenses and assets which helped us take advantage of the significant sales increase we experienced in the second half as the economy improved. During the second half, and especially in the fourth quarter, our asset management efforts generated LIFO layer liquidation benefits that positively impacted our income statement.

This press release contains statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "expect" and similar expressions. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by Applied or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Applied assumes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, or events, or otherwise.
For investor relations information, contact Mark O. Eisele, Vice President  Chief Financial Officer, at 216-426-4417. For corporate information, contact Richard C. Shaw, Vice President  Communications, at 216-426-4343.
 
(1) Applied uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
Applied began a planned effort to reduce certain excess U.S. inventories in July of 2009 and continued the effort throughout fiscal 2010. These reductions resulted in the liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years. As a result, a LIFO benefit reduced our cost of goods sold by $16.2 million in the fourth quarter and by $23.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2010, equating to a $0.23 and a $0.33 earnings per share benefit, respectively. The overall LIFO reserves were reduced by the same amounts.
If inventory levels had remained constant with the June 30, 2009 levels, instead of recording the benefit as described in the above paragraph, the Company would have recorded LIFO expense of $6.9 million in the three months and $19.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2010.
The overall impact of LIFO layer liquidations during the three months and year ended June 30, 2010, increased gross profit by $23.1 million and $42.7 million, respectively. LIFO layer liquidations recorded in fiscal 2009 increased gross profit by $4.4 million.
(2) In the fiscal 2009 fourth quarter, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge that decreased operating income by $36,605, net income by $23,000 and net income per share by $0.54.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported first quarter fiscal 2011 sales and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2010.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, October 26, 2010
Net sales for the first quarter increased 20.5% to $527,501,000 from $437,743,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 85.5% to $20,755,000 or $0.48 per share compared to $11,187,000 or $0.26 per share last year.
"We are pleased with the strength shown by our first quarter sales and operating results," said David L. Pugh, Applied's Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. "Our sales showed steady growth over prior year comparables throughout the quarter on the basis of increased demand from the majority of our industrial segments. We see this level of demand continuing for the foreseeable future.
"Our attention to detail in the areas of cost control and asset management allowed us to leverage this sales growth into strong operating income and cash flow. Inventories expanded about $10 million net of acquisitions and price increases, as we increased our stock to safeguard against increased lead times in our supply chain. Gross margin percentage of 27.1% was stronger than our projected run-rate due to some one-time benefits. For the remainder of the year, we expect our gross margin will be slightly lower.
"At quarter's end we used $50 million in cash to reduce our short-term debt, and we expect to be free of debt by the end of November. We also used a portion of our cash to fund the acquisitions of UZ Engineered Products and SCS Supply Group, both of which were purchased during the quarter.
"We believe that we will continue to see moderate growth in our daily sales run rates from the current levels throughout the remaining three quarters of our fiscal year. Based on the strength of our first quarter performance, we are raising our earnings guidance for the full fiscal year 2011 and now expect to achieve earnings of $1.80 to $2.05 per share compared to our previous forecast of $1.70 to $1.95. We are maintaining our full-year sales guidance of $2.05 to $2.25 billion."
The Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. At September 30, 2010, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 837,200 additional shares.
 
The Company will host its quarterly conference call for investors and analysts at 4 p.m. ET on October 26, 2010. To join the call, dial 1-800-774-6070 or 1-630-691-2753 (for International callers) using passcode 9629151.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2009, the Company recorded a LIFO benefit as part of a LIFO layer liquidation, that reduced cost of goods sold by $0.7 million and reduced the LIFO reserve by the same amount. The overall effect of the LIFO layer liquidations during the quarter ending September 30, 2009 increased gross profit by $4.3 million.
     (2) In July and August 2010, the Company completed two acquisitions for an aggregate cash purchase price of $32 million. UZ Engineered Products (UZ) is a distributor of industrial supply products for maintenance, repair, and operational needs, in the government and commercial sectors, throughout the US and Canada.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported second quarter fiscal 2011 sales and earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2010.
CLEVELAND, OHIO (January 21, 2011)
Net sales for the second quarter increased 18.7% to $529,517,000 from $446,253,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 102% to $21,193,000 or $0.49 per share compared to $10,487,000 or $0.24 per share last year.
For the six months ended December 31, 2010, sales were $1,057,018,000 compared to $883,996,000 in the same period last year. Net income was $41,948,000 or $0.97 per share compared to $21,674,000 or $0.51 per share, last year.
"We were once again pleased with the strength of our quarterly results, and with our ability to efficiently convert sales increases to proportionately higher levels of profitability," said David L. Pugh, Applied's Chairman & Chief Executive Officer. "Our strong performance is fueled by the recovering industrial economy and, in particular, exceptional results within those segments of our fluid power business that provide products and solutions for automation and machine control applications.
"We continue to execute the business fundamentals quite well with a focus on cost control and operational efficiency. We generated a second quarter operating margin of 6.2%, up from 4.2% in the same quarter a year ago, further demonstrating that we are actively managing our business with the increased pace of the economy. We also paid off the remainder of our existing debt, further improving our capacity to grow our business for the future.
"We believe that we will continue to see moderate growth in our daily sales run rates from the current levels throughout the remaining two quarters of our fiscal year. Based on the strength of our second quarter performance, we are raising our earnings guidance for the full fiscal year 2011 and now expect to achieve earnings of $1.90 to $2.10 per share compared to our previous forecast of $1.80 to $2.05 per share. We are raising the low end of our full-year sales guidance from $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion and maintaining our high end estimate of $2.25 billion."

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
     On April 21, 2011, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied") issued an earnings release related to its third quarter ended March 31, 2011. The earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K.
     The information in this Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit, is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
     Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
Date: April 21, 2011
 

Exhibit 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported third quarter fiscal 2011 sales and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2011.
CLEVELAND, OHIO (April 21, 2011)
Net sales for the third quarter increased 16.4% to $565,970,000 from $486,141,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased 60.6% to $26,536,000 or $0.61 per share compared to $16,525,000 or $0.39 per share last year.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2011, sales increased 18.5% to $1,622,988,000 from $1,370,137,000 in the same period last year. Net income increased 79.3% to $68,484,000 or $1.58 per share compared to $38,199,000 or $0.89 per share, last year.
Commenting on the Company's performance, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "Our third quarter performance was fueled by a solid industrial economy. While we expect this economy to continue its recovery and to deliver a positive ongoing impact, such issues as oil prices and geo-political events dictate that we also maintain a focus on the underlying fundamentals of our business. Our balanced approach will allow us to take maximum advantage of an improved market. Our cost control and margin improvement efforts have positioned us to leverage our sales gains into strong profit contribution. Our asset management is equally strong, providing excellent cash generation to support aggressive strategic initiatives.
 
"Our ERP project is on track both from a timing and a total cost perspective. However, we were able to expense our costs during the quarter at a faster rate than we had forecast. Even with this additional expense, we generated a third quarter operating margin of 6.7%, up from 5.6% in the same quarter a year ago. This further demonstrates that we are executing well with the increased pace of the economy.
"We expect a moderate economic tailwind to help provide continued growth in our daily sales run rates throughout the remainder of our fiscal year.

This press release contains statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "expect," "guidance," and similar expressions. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Applied assumes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, or events, or otherwise, except as required by law.
For investor relations information, contact Mark O. Eisele, Vice President  Chief Financial Officer, at 216-426-4417. For corporate information, contact Richard C. Shaw, Vice President  Communications, at 216-426-4343.
 
     (1) Applied uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
During the quarter and nine months ended March 31, 2011, the Company recorded overall LIFO benefits of $0.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively and the LIFO reserves were reduced by the same amounts. These reductions resulted from some effective supplier price decreases in the first half of our fiscal year as well as LIFO layer liquidation benefits (of $2.0 million for the quarter and $2.7 million year to date) from certain inventory quantity levels decreasing. If inventory levels had remained constant, additional LIFO expense in the amount of the layer liquidation would have been recorded.
In the prior year, overall LIFO benefits were $4.8 million for the quarter and were $7.3 million year to date. These benefits resulted from decreases in inventory quantities which generated LIFO layer liquidation benefits of $9.6 million for the quarter and $19.6 million for the year to date.
     (2) The Company is the owner and beneficiary under life insurance policies with benefits in force of $14.0 million and a net cash surrender value of $3.2 million at June 30, 2010. In January 2011, the Company received $1.8 million in benefits under these policies and realized a gain (included in other (income) expense, net) of $1.7 million in the quarter ending March 31, 2011.

Exhibit 99.1
CLEVELAND, Ohio, August 9, 2011  Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2011 year ended June 30, 2011.
Fiscal 2011 full-year sales were a record $2,212,849,000, up 16.9% from fiscal 2010 sales of $1,893,208,000. Net income for the year was a record $96,759,000, or $2.24 per share, compared with $65,903,000, or $1.54 per share in fiscal 2010, an increase in net income of 46.8%.
Quarterly performance also set new records with net sales for the fourth quarter of $589,861,000, up 12.8% from $523,071,000 in the prior-year quarter. Net income for the quarter was $28,275,000 or $0.65 per share, up 2.1% from $27,704,000 or $0.64 in the same quarter last year. Comparing 2011 fourth quarter net income to the same period last year, 2011 included $4.8 million of expense for the development of Applied's new ERP system, an expense which did not occur in fiscal 2010. Additionally, last year's fourth quarter net income was bolstered by a substantially higher LIFO layer liquidation benefit.
Commenting on results, Applied Chairman & Chief Executive Officer David L. Pugh said, "We had an excellent year, turning in our highest year-over-year percentage sales increase since 1998, and exceeding all expectations on net income. Our sales growth initiatives during the year were very effective and, combined with our attention to detail and our balanced approach to operating fundamentals, enabled us to generate strong earnings growth.
"For the second year in a row, our asset management efforts positioned us to record LIFO benefits and provided excellent cash flow. We ended the year debt free, which puts us in an excellent position to pursue accretive acquisitions.
"We have made good progress on our ERP implementation. We are on-time and on-budget as I would have expected given our advance planning and the level of oversight we have extended to the project." Pugh continued, "First implementation with certain of our Canadian businesses is expected by calendar year end, and we will then roll it out to other North American businesses over the next two years. We fully expect that the new system will contribute to greater productivity, enhanced profitability, improved visibility, and more efficient overall operation of Applied's business.
"Looking forward, we believe we'll see continued improvement in our results, although at a slower pace than we have recently experienced due to tougher comparables and a weaker industrial economy. Based on these expectations, we are providing earnings per share guidance for fiscal 2012 in the range of $2.40 to $2.55, on expected sales of $2.35 billion to $2.45 billion."
During the quarter, the Company purchased 46,800 shares of its common stock in open market transactions for $1.6 million. For the full fiscal year, purchases totaled 189,600 shares for $6.1 million. At June 30, 2011, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 647,600 additional shares.

This press release contains statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "expect," "believe," "will," "guidance," and similar expressions. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by Applied or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Applied assumes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, or events, or otherwise.

(1) Applied uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
During the quarter and year ended June 30, 2011, the Company recorded overall LIFO benefits of $2.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively and the LIFO reserves were reduced by the same amounts. These reductions resulted from some effective supplier price decreases in the first half of our fiscal year as well as LIFO layer liquidation benefits (of $9.6 million for the quarter and $12.3 million for the year) from certain inventory quantity levels decreasing. If inventory levels had remained constant, additional LIFO expense in the amount of the layer liquidation would have been recorded.
In the prior year, overall LIFO benefits were $16.2 million for the quarter and were $23.5 million for the year. These benefits resulted from decreases in inventory quantities which generated LIFO layer liquidation benefits of $23.1 million for the quarter and $42.7 million for the year to date.
(2) During the year end June 30, 2011, the Company received death benefits under two life insurance policies and realized a gain (included in other (income) expense, net) of $1.7 million.

ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: August 12, 2011
 

Exhibit 10.01
Authority
The annual Management Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is established by the Board's Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") under the 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "2007 LTPP").
Objective
The Plan's objective is to reward eligible participants for their contributions toward the achievement of Applied's fiscal year business goals.
Participation
The Plan's participants are those key employees of Applied who are designated as Plan participants by the Committee.
Plan Goals
The Committee shall establish the Plan's goals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of (i) a merger, a consolidation, an acquisition or divestiture, the issuance or repurchase of a substantial amount of capital stock, a reorganization or restructuring, or any other transaction or series of transactions, or (ii) asset write-downs, or litigation or claim judgments or settlements, or foreign exchange gains or losses, or (iii) changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, or (iv) other extraordinary nonrecurring items, then the Committee, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Plan goals, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be conferred, in such manner as the Committee determines is equitably required by the changes or events.
Eligibility for Awards
If Plan goals are met, to be eligible for an award under the Plan, a participant must comply with the terms and conditions of the 2007 LTPP. In addition, except as provided in the 2007 LTPP, the participant must be actively employed by Applied on the last day of the fiscal year, except that,
 
Plan awards are intended to create an incentive for participants to act in Applied's best interests. Notwithstanding anything in these terms to the contrary,
 
 
The provisions of this section are a fundamental term of the award.
Change in Control
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the participant's employment with Applied is terminated during the fiscal year, following any Change in Control of Applied, either by the participant for "Good Reason" or by Applied "Without Cause", then the award shall be deemed to be fully earned at the target incentive value.
For purposes of this award, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by the participant to perform substantially the participant's duties with Applied or one of its affiliates (other than for disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the participant by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of Applied which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the participant has not substantially performed the participant's duties, or (ii) the willful engagement by the participant in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to Applied; , that no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without the participant's reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of Applied. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given the participant pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of Applied or based upon the advice of counsel for Applied shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of Applied. Termination of the participant's employment with Applied shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall
provided, however
have been delivered to the participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the participant and the participant is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the participant is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
For purposes of this award, "Good Reason" shall mean (i) a material diminution in the participant's authority, duties, or responsibilities, (ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom the participant reported immediately prior to a Change in Control, (iii) a material diminution by Applied of the annual base salary that was provided to the participant by Applied immediately prior to the Change in Control, (iv) a material change in the geographic location where the participant provides service to Applied, or (v) any failure of any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Applied, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the participant, to expressly assume and agree to comply with the terms of this award in the same manner and to the same extent that Applied would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; , that, Good Reason shall not have occurred unless the participant gives Applied notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by the participant in good faith to constitute Good Reason and Applied has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition.
provided further
Notwithstanding the definition in the Plan, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall have occurred for purposes of this award (to the extent this award does not constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A) when any of the following events shall occur:
(i) Applied is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock (as that term is hereafter defined) of Applied immediately prior to such transaction;
(ii) Applied sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, and, immediately after such sale, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of Applied immediately prior to such sale;
(iii) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of Applied ("Voting Stock");
(iv) Applied files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of Applied has occurred pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(v) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the directors of Applied cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority
thereof, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (v), each director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by Applied's stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of Applied (or a committee thereof) then still in office who were directors of Applied at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of Applied at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of (iii) or (iv) hereof, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this award solely because (i) Applied, (ii) an entity in which Applied directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Applied-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of Applied, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule 14D-1, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 30% or otherwise, or because Applied reports that a change in control of Applied has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to limit any economic benefit to which the participant is entitled under this award or the Plan.
To the extent this award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of Applied or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Applied that constitutes a "change in control" under Section 409A.
Other
The Committee has the authority to construe the Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations, in the Committee's judgment, necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration.
The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency with respect to the Plan in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under these provisions shall be conclusive for all purposes.
The provisions of these terms and conditions are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
The validity, construction, interpretation, and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
Applied has made no warranties or representations to the participant with respect to the tax consequences (including but not limited to income tax consequences) related to the Plan, and the participant has been advised to consult with the participant's attorney, accountant and/or tax advisor regarding the Plan. Moreover, the participant acknowledges that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for the participant.

To the extent this award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of Applied or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Applied that constitutes a "change in control" under Section 409A.

Moreover, the participant acknowledges that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for the participant.
(August 2011)

Exhibit 10.03
Your Stock Appreciation Rights Award (the "SARs" or the "Award") is made by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Applied"). For purposes of these terms and conditions, employment by a parent, subsidiary, or an affiliate of Applied shall be considered employment by Applied.
The Award is governed by Applied's 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan"), including the policies adopted by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of Applied's Board of Directors (the "Committee") under the Plan, and these terms and conditions. Upon valid exercise, the Award entitles you to receive such number of shares of Applied common stock ("Shares") that have a fair market value equal to the difference (if positive) between the fair market value of (a) a Share on the date of exercise over (b) the Base Price, multiplied by (c) the number of Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised, subject to the following conditions:
1. Grant of SARs; Exercisability.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2 and 7, below, your Award will be exercisable only if and after you have remained in Applied's continuous employ from the Award's grant date (the "Grant Date") to the vesting date of all or the specified portion of your Award. Your Award vests with respect to only 25% of the aggregate number of Shares to which it relates after one year of continuous employment from the Grant Date, which percentage increases to 50% after two years, to 75% after three years, and to 100% after four years of continuous employment from the Grant Date.
(b) Except as otherwise provided, your Award shall expire at the end of the 10-year period commencing with the Grant Date (the "Term"), or upon such earlier expiration or your separation from service date as may be provided by Sections 2 and 7 below. The SARs shall not be exercisable thereafter.
If, during the Term, you incur a separation from service from Applied for any reason, you may exercise your SARs, to the extent you were entitled to exercise them immediately prior to your separation from service, at any time within three months after your separation from service (but only during the Term); , that (i) if you Retire, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within three years after your retirement (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; (ii) if you incur a separation from service due to your permanent and total disability, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your separation from service (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; and (iii) if you die while employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your death (but only during the Term), the person entitled by will or applicable law to exercise the SARs may do so.
2. Termination of SARs.
provided, however
Because Awards are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests, notwithstanding anything in these terms to the contrary,
(a) Your Award may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required to immediately repay all Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous six months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending six months
following your separation from service, you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, or vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective at the time of your act.
(b) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (x) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (y) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (I) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (II) your earnings pursuant to the Award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
The provisions of this section are a fundamental term of the Award.
During your life, your Award may be exercised only by you, your guardian, or legal representative. Upon your death, your Award may be exercised by the person entitled by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
3. Method of Exercise; Rights of Holder.
Your SARs may be exercised by delivering to Applied at its principal executive offices (directed to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Secretary) a written notice (which may include facsimile transmission or electronic mail), signed by you or such other person entitled to exercise the SARs, of the election to exercise the SARs and stating the number of Shares as to which the SARs are being exercised. The SARs shall be deemed exercised as of the date Applied receives the notice. If the SARs are exercised, as provided herein, by any person other than you, the notice shall be accompanied by appropriate evidence of that person's right to exercise the SARs. As a condition to your valid exercise of the SARs, you hereby consent to Applied withholding from the Shares issuable upon exercise (if any), such number of Shares the fair market value of which Applied determines to be equal to the amount required to be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state or local law, including tax withholding requirements. Promptly following the proper exercise of the SARs, Applied shall issue in the name of the person exercising the SARs, a certificate representing the Shares due hereunder. Your SARs may be exercised only with respect to a whole number of Shares, and may not be exercised in fractional amounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and the restrictions on exercise contained in Section 2, if, in the event your employment with Applied is terminated within the three-year period immediately following any Change in Control of Applied either by you for "Good Reason" or by Applied "Without Cause", then your SARs then outstanding shall become fully exercisable as of the date immediately prior to the date of termination of your employment.
For purposes of this Award, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your duties with Applied or one of its affiliates (other than for disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of Applied which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or (ii) the willful engagement by you in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to Applied; , that no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without your reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of Applied. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given you pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief
provided, however
Executive Officer or a senior officer of Applied or based upon the advice of counsel for Applied shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of Applied. Termination of your employment with Applied shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to you and you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
For purposes of this Award, "Good Reason" shall mean a separation from service that occurs no later than two years after (i) a material diminution in your authority, duties, or responsibilities, (ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom you reported immediately prior to a Change in Control, (iii) a material diminution by Applied of your annual base salary that was provided to you by Applied immediately prior to the Change in Control, (iv) a material change in the geographic location where you provide service to Applied, or (v) any failure of any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Applied, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to you, to expressly assume and agree to comply with the terms of this Award in the same manner and to the same extent that Applied would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; , that, Good Reason shall not have occurred unless you give Applied notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by you in good faith to constitute Good Reason and Applied has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition.
provided further
Notwithstanding the definition in the Plan, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall have occurred for purposes of this Award (to the extent this Award does not constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A) when any of the following events shall occur:
(i) Applied is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock (as that term is hereafter defined) of Applied immediately prior to such transaction;
(ii) Applied sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, and, immediately after such sale, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of Applied immediately prior to such sale;
(iii) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of Applied ("Voting Stock");
(iv) Applied files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of Applied has occurred pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(v) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the directors of Applied cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (v), each director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by Applied's stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of Applied (or a committee thereof) then still in office who were directors of Applied at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of Applied at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section (iii) or (iv) hereof, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Award solely because (i) Applied, (ii) an entity in which Applied directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Applied-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of Applied, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule 14D-1, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 30% or otherwise, or because Applied reports that a change in control of Applied has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled under this Award or the Plan, including the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c) below. In the event of the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c), the provisions in Section 7 purporting to terminate your SARS shall not apply and you shall have the option either to exercise your rights under Section 7 or to deem the SARs assumed by the successor within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever is more favorable to you.
To the extent this Award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of Applied or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Applied that constitutes a "change in control" under Section 409A.
In addition, to the extent this Award is subject to Section 409A, Shares will be issued and distributed to you within 90 calendar days after receipt by Applied of your written notice of exercise; provided that if such 90-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, you shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution due to a Separation from Service may not be made until the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of your death, except in each case as may be otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
As an SAR holder, you shall have absolutely no rights as a shareholder, whether before or after vesting of all or any portion of your Award.
Your SARs shall not be exercisable if such exercise or the issuance of Shares pursuant to your Award would violate:
4. Limitations on Exercise.
(a) Any state securities law;
(b) Any registration or other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any stock exchange's listing requirements; or
(c) Any other legal requirement of any governmental authority.
If your exercise of SARs is prevented by the terms of any of the foregoing subsections, and the Term of the SARs expires, then you may, within 30 days after Applied notifies you that your exercise is no longer prevented by this Section 4, exercise the SARs to the extent they would have been exercisable but for the operation of this Section 4.
Furthermore, if a registration statement with respect to Shares issuable upon exercise of the SARs is not in effect or if Applied's counsel otherwise deems it necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible violations of the Act, Applied may require, as a condition to its issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares, the delivery to Applied of a commitment in writing by the person exercising the SARs that (i) at the time of the exercise it is his intention to acquire the Shares for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof; (ii) the person understands that the Shares may be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 issued under the Act; and (iii) any resale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares will be accomplished only in compliance with Rule 144, the Act, or other or subsequent rules and regulations thereunder. Applied may place on the certificates representing the Shares a legend reflecting that commitment and Applied may refuse to permit transfer of the Shares until it has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it that no violation of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would be involved in the transfer.
The Award is not a guaranty of employment or commitment by Applied of continued employment. Nothing in the Award or these terms and conditions alters, limits or restricts any right Applied would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of your employment.
5. No Guaranty of Employment.
The Award is not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, and may not be otherwise disposed of by you, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or with the prior written consent of Applied.
6. Nonassignability.
If (a) Applied is to be merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity so that Applied is not the surviving corporation and, immediately after such event, the holders of Shares immediately prior to the event hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity, (b) Applied is to be dissolved or liquidated, or (c) substantially all of Applied's assets are to be sold, then the Committee shall give you 30 days' prior written notice. Upon the giving of that notice, if you are employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully vested and exercisable. Within the 30-day period (but only during the Term), you shall have the right to exercise your SARs. Thereafter, notwithstanding any other provision of these terms and conditions, the SARs shall expire, unless "assumed" by another corporation within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
7. Liquidation, Dissolution, Merger, Sale of Substantially All Assets.
In the event (a) of a stock dividend or stock split or (b) the Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the Shares purchasable or the Base Price hereunder shall be equitably adjusted so that the SARs represent the right to acquire Shares or the number and kind of other securities that are economically equivalent to what the Shares would have represented had the SARs been fully exercised immediately preceding such event.
8. Adjustments.
In the event other changes or events relating to the Shares fundamentally change the value of the Shares or securities for which the SARs are exercisable, then the Committee may make, in its sole discretion, such adjustments in the terms of the SARs as the Committee may determine is equitably required by the change or event.
The Committee shall have authority, subject to the Plan's express provisions, to construe these terms and conditions and the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the Committee's judgment necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or these terms and conditions in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under this Section shall be conclusive for all purposes.
9. Committee Authority.
In the event of any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and any provision of the Plan or the Committee's policies, the Plan or the policies shall govern. Terms used but not otherwise defined in these terms and conditions shall have the meaning ascribed them in the Plan. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, these terms and conditions and the SARs granted shall be subject to all of the Plan's provisions in effect from time to time, which are incorporated herein by reference.
10. Relationship to the Plan.
. The provisions of these terms and conditions are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
11.
Severability
. . The validity, construction, interpretation and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
12
Applicable Law
. . Applied has made no warranties or representations to you with respect to the tax consequences (including but not limited to income tax consequences) related to the Award or the issuance, transfer or disposition of Shares pursuant to the Award, and you have been advised to consult with your attorney, accountant and/or tax advisor regarding this Award. Moreover, you acknowledge that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for you.

Tax Matters
(August 2011  officers)

Exhibit 10.04
. The Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied") on the Grant Date awarded you a certain number of restricted stock units (the "RSUs"). Such award represents your right to receive an equal number of shares of Applied common stock ("Shares"), issuable from Applied's available treasury shares, upon the expiration of the Restriction Period (as defined in Section 3 hereof). The terms and conditions of the RSUs as set forth herein (the "Terms") together with the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan") govern your rights with respect to the RSUs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the Terms, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. Moreover, it should be noted that unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized words in the Terms shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Plan.
1. Award of Restricted Stock Units
. You shall not have the right to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber or dispose of the RSUs until all conditions with respect to vesting and distribution have been met. Nevertheless, during the Restriction Period and so long as no forfeiture has occurred, you shall be entitled to receive cash payments equal to the dividends and cash distributions paid on Shares underlying the RSUs ("Dividend Equivalents") to the same extent and on the same date as if each RSU were a Share; provided, however, that no Dividend Equivalents shall be payable to you with respect to dividends or distributions the record date for which occurs on or after (i) the date on which a forfeiture of the RSUs has occurred, (ii) the date on which the Restriction Period has expired, or (iii) the date on which issuance of Shares to you has occurred. You shall not have voting rights with respect to the RSUs and, until the issuance of Shares in settlement of the RSUs, you shall not be treated as a shareholder with respect to the Shares.
2. Rights during Restriction Period
. The term "Restriction Period" means the period from the Grant Date until the 3
3. Restriction Period
rd
anniversary of the Grant Date.
. Except as specifically provided otherwise in Sections 5 and 6, you will be 100% vested in the RSUs as of the end of the Restriction Period; provided, however, that in the event you incur a Separation from Service during the Restriction Period after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, you will be vested at the end of the Restriction Period in a pro rata portion of the RSUs equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the number of fiscal quarters (including a portion of a quarter) elapsed in the Restriction Period prior to the date of such Separation from Service and the denominator of which is twelve.
4. Vesting
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, but subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) hereunder, if, during the Restriction Period, you incur a Separation from Service (as defined in Section 409A) from Applied due to death or Disability (as defined under Section 409A) then (i) you (or your beneficiary designated to Applied in writing) shall be vested in a pro rata portion of the RSUs equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the number of fiscal quarters (including a portion of a quarter) elapsed in the Restriction Period prior to the date of such Separation
5. Separation from Service
from Service and the denominator of which is twelve, and (ii) the remaining RSUs shall be deemed forfeited. In the event, however, that you, during the Restriction Period, incur a Separation from Service from Applied for any reason other than (i) those specifically set forth above or in Section 6, or (ii) termination after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, then the entire award of RSUs shall be forfeited and no amount shall be due or payable to you under the Terms.
Because awards of RSUs are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests, notwithstanding anything in the Terms to the contrary:
(a) Your award of RSUs may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends, distributions, and Dividend Equivalents thereon) issued pursuant to the award of RSUs hereunder within the previous six months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending six months following the your Separation from Service, you committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers, or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, or vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective as of the time of your act.
(b) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends, distributions, and Dividend Equivalents thereon) issued pursuant to the award of RSUs hereunder within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (I) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (II) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (x) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (y) your earnings pursuant to the award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 4 and 5, in the event your employment with Applied is terminated during the Restriction Period and within the three-year period immediately following any Change in Control of Applied either by you for "Good Reason" or by Applied "Without Cause", then all of the RSUs awarded hereunder to you shall be 100% vested.
6. Change in Control
For purposes of the RSUs, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your duties with Applied or one of its affiliates (other than for disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of Applied which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or (ii) the willful engagement by you in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to Applied; , that no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without your reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of Applied. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given you pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of Applied or based upon the advice of counsel for Applied shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of Applied. Termination of your employment with Applied shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to you and you are given an opportunity,
provided, however
together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
For purposes of the RSUs, "Good Reason" shall mean a separation from service that occurs no later than two years after (i) a material diminution in your authority, duties, or responsibilities, (ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom you reported immediately prior to a Change in Control, (iii) a material diminution by Applied of your annual base salary that was provided to you by Applied immediately prior to the Change in Control, (iv) a material change in the geographic location where you provide service to Applied, or (v) any failure of any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Applied, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to you, to expressly assume and agree to comply with these Terms in the same manner and to the same extent that Applied would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; , that, Good Reason shall not have occurred unless you give Applied notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by you in good faith to constitute Good Reason and Applied has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition.
provided further
Notwithstanding the definition in the Plan, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall have occurred for purposes of the RSUs (to the extent the RSUs do not constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A) when any of the following events shall occur:
(i) Applied is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock (as that term is hereafter defined) of Applied immediately prior to such transaction;
(ii) Applied sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, and, immediately after such sale, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of Applied immediately prior to such sale;
(iii) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of Applied ("Voting Stock");
(iv) Applied files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of Applied has occurred pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(v) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the directors of Applied cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (v), each director
who is first elected, or first nominated for election by Applied's stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of Applied (or a committee thereof) then still in office who were directors of Applied at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of Applied at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of (iii) or (iv) hereof, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Award solely because (i) Applied, (ii) an entity in which Applied directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Applied-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of Applied, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule 14D-1, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 30% or otherwise, or because Applied reports that a change in control of Applied has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled with respect to the RSUs or under the Plan.
To the extent the RSUs constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of Applied or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Applied that constitutes a "change in control" under Section 409A.
In addition, to the extent the RSUs are subject to Section 409A, Shares will be issued and distributed to you within 90 calendar days after vesting; provided that if such 90-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, you shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution due to a separation from service may not be made until the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of your death, except in each case as may be otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
. In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, exchange, spin-off, spin-out, or other distribution of assets to shareholders, or other similar event or change in capitalization such that shares of Applied common stock are changed into or become exchangeable for a different number of shares, thereafter the number of RSUs will be increased or decreased, as the case may be, in direct proportion to the increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock by reason of such change in corporate structure; provided, however, that the number of RSUs shall always be a whole number. If there occurs any other change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of common stock or other Applied securities, or of any shares of stock or other securities into which such shares of common stock shall have been changed or for which they shall have been exchanged, then Applied may adjust the number or kind of RSUs or other securities into which the RSUs may be settled, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine is equitable, and such adjustment so made shall be effective and binding for all purposes.
7. Adjustment of RSUs for Certain Events
. Your award of RSUs hereunder shall be settled in whole Shares. Fractional Shares shall not be issuable hereunder and any fractional Share shall be disregarded. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Section 8, Shares subject to an award of RSUs hereunder shall only be issued and distributed to you in a single sum of whole
8. Settlement of Award and Distribution of Shares
Shares within the 75-day period after the end of the Restriction Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that your RSUs become vested due to death, Disability or a Change in Control, the award of RSUs hereunder shall be settled in a single sum of whole Shares within the 75-day period after such vesting. In the event that any such 75-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, you (or your beneficiary as the case may be) shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Moreover, notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution of Shares may not be made until within the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following the month of any Separation from Service for reasons other than Disability or a Change in Control, or, if earlier, your death, except as maybe otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
. Upon the vesting of the RSUs, Applied shall withhold Shares from your award for any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by Applied attributable to the award.
9. Payment of Taxes
. To the extent applicable, it is intended the Terms and the award of RSUs shall comply with or be exempt from the provisions of Section 409A and any interpretations of these terms shall be consistent with such intent.
10. Section 409A Compliance
. The Committee shall have conclusive authority, subject to the express provisions of the Plan as in effect from time to time and the Terms, to construe the Terms and the Plan, and to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Terms in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect, and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. Applied's Board of Directors (the "Board") may from time to time grant to the Committee such further powers and authority as the Board shall determine to be necessary or desirable. Notwithstanding any other provision of these terms, any amendment, construction, establishment, rescission or correction of the type referred to above which is made or adopted following a Change in Control, and which amendment, construction, establishment or correction adversely affects your rights hereunder, shall be in writing and shall be effective only with your express and prior written consent .
11. Administration of the Plan
. The Terms are subject to the provisions of the Plan and any administrative policies adopted by the Committee. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms and the Plan or such policies, the Plan and the policies, in that order, shall govern. References in the Terms to Applied shall include Applied's subsidiaries.
12. Relationship to the Plan
. The provisions of the Terms are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
13. Severability
. The Terms and your award shall not confer upon you any rights whatsoever other than those expressly set forth herein, in the Plan or in policies adopted by the Committee. Nothing in the Terms shall (i) interfere with or limit in any way Applied's right to terminate your employment at any time, (ii) confer upon you any right to continued employment with Applied, or (iii) create any contractual or other right to receive additional awards or other Plan benefits in the future.
14. No Guarantee of Employment
. The granting of the RSUs hereunder shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agency, national securities exchange, or automated quotation system may be required. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Terms, Applied shall not be obligated to issue, deliver or transfer any Shares, make any distribution of benefits under the Plan or the Terms, or take any other action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, the requirements of the Securities Act and Section 409A).
15. Requirements of Law
. All obligations of Applied under the Terms with respect to the RSUs shall be binding upon any successor to Applied, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all, or substantially all, of the business and/or assets of Applied. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, in the event any such successor does not agree to be bound by the Terms, the RSUs granted hereunder shall immediately become vested.
16. Successors
. The validity, construction, interpretation and enforceability of these Terms shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
17. Applicable Law
. Applied has made no warranties or representations to you with respect to the tax consequences (including but not limited to income tax consequences) related to the RSUs or the issuance, transfer or disposition of Shares pursuant to the RSUs, and you have been advised to consult with your attorney, accountant and/or tax advisor regarding the RSUs. Moreover, you acknowledge that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for you.

("Applied") may award Performance Shares (the "Award") to key senior officers of Applied who have broad policy-making functions and who directly contribute to the long-term success and profitability of Applied. The Committee has awarded you an Award with an Effective Date. The terms and conditions are set forth herein (the "Terms") and together with the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan") govern your rights with respect to the Award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the Terms, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. Moreover, it should be noted that unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized words in the Terms shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Plan.
1. Award of Performance Shares
. You shall not have the right to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber your Award until all conditions with respect to vesting and distribution have been met. Until the issuance of shares of Applied common stock ("Shares") to you in settlement of your Award has occurred, you shall not be treated as a shareholder with respect to the Shares.
2. Rights during Performance Period
. The term "Performance Period" shall mean, for purposes of the Terms, the period from the Effective Date until the third year anniversary of the Effective Date.
3. Performance Period
. Subject to the provisions of Section 6, your Award will be 100% vested at the end of the Performance Period, in whole or in part based upon the achievement of the performance goals set by the Committee.
4. Vesting
. If, during the Performance Period, you incur a Separation from Service (as defined in Section 409A) from Applied due to death or Disability (as defined in Section 409A) or termination after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, then, promptly following the availability of audited financial statements for the final year of the Performance Period, you (or your beneficiary whom you have designated to Applied in writing) shall be entitled to vesting of a portion of the Award based on Applied's actual performance relative to the performance goals for the individual years (partial years shall be prorated by quarter, including a portion of a quarter) in the Performance Period that elapsed prior to your Separation from Service. In the event, however, that during the Performance Period, you incur a Separation from Service from Applied for any reason other than those specifically set forth above or in Section 6 hereof, then your Award will be forfeited and no amount shall be due or payable to you pursuant to the Award. In addition, if, during the Performance Period, you cease to be a Board-elected executive officer of Applied (but remain an employee of Applied), then your Award shall be forfeited and no amount shall be due or payable to you pursuant to the Award.
5. Separation from Service or Termination of Executive Officer Status
Because Awards are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests, notwithstanding anything in the Terms to the contrary:
(a) Your Award may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous six months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending six months following your Separation from Service, you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, and vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective at the time of your act.
(b) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (I) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (II) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (x) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (y) your earnings pursuant to the Award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, in the event your employment with Applied is terminated during the Performance Period and following any Change in Control of Applied either by you for "Good Reason" or by Applied "Without Cause," then you shall be 100% vested and entitled to receive a pro rata amount of Shares under the Award equal to (i) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of fiscal quarters (including a portion of a quarter) elapsed in the Performance Period prior to the date of the Change in Control and the denominator of which is twelve, multiplied by (ii) your target award amount.
6. Change in Control
For purposes of this Award, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your duties with Applied or one of its affiliates (other than for disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of Applied which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or (ii) the willful engagement by you in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to Applied; , that no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without your reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of Applied. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given you pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of Applied or based upon the advice of counsel for Applied shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of Applied. Termination of your employment with Applied shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to you and you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
provided, however
For purposes of this Award, "Good Reason" shall mean a separation from service that occurs no later than two years after (i) a material diminution in your authority, duties, or responsibilities, (ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom you reported immediately prior to a Change in Control, (iii) a material diminution by Applied of your annual base
salary that was provided to you by Applied immediately prior to the Change in Control, (iv) a material change in the geographic location where you provide service to Applied, or (v) any failure of any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Applied, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to you, to expressly assume and agree to comply with the terms of this award in the same manner and to the same extent that Applied would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; , that, Good Reason shall not have occurred unless you give Applied notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by you in good faith to constitute Good Reason and Applied has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition.
provided further
Notwithstanding the definition in the Plan, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall have occurred for purposes of this Award when any of the following events shall occur:
(i) Applied is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock (as that term is hereafter defined) of Applied immediately prior to such transaction;
(ii) Applied sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of Applied immediately prior to such sale;
(iii) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule 14D-1 (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of Applied ("Voting Stock");
(iv) Applied files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of Applied has occurred pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(v) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the directors of Applied cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (v), each director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by Applied's stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of Applied (or a committee thereof) then still in office who were directors of Applied at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of Applied at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section (iii) or (iv) hereof, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Award solely because (i) Applied, (ii) an entity in which Applied directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Applied-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of Applied, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement
under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule 14D-1, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 30% or otherwise, or because Applied reports that a change in control of Applied has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled under this Award or the Plan.
To the extent this Award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of Applied or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Applied that constitutes a "change in control" under Section 409A. In addition, to the extent this Award is subject to Section 409A, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution due to a Separation from Service may not be made until the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of your death, except in each case as may be otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
. Your Award shall be settled, based upon achieved performance goals, in Shares. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Section 7, any Shares payable with respect to your Award shall be settled within the 75-day period after the end of the Performance Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that your Award becomes vested due to a Change in Control, your Award shall be settled in Shares within the 75-day period after such vesting. In the event that any such 75-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, you shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Moreover, notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution of Shares, but only to the extent that such distribution is deemed to be deferred compensation under Section 409A, may not be made until within the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following the month of any Separation from Service for reasons other than Change in Control, or if earlier, your death, except as may be otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
7. Settlement of Award
. Upon the vesting of the Award, Applied shall withhold Shares from your award for any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by Applied attributable to the Award.
8. Payments of Taxes
In the event that, during the Performance Period, Applied merges, consolidates, sells or acquires a substantial amount of assets, issues a substantial amount of its capital stock, reorganizes, or engages in any other transaction or series of transactions, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may change the performance goals upon which the vesting of your Award is conditioned, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be conferred by the Award in such manner as the Committee may determine is equitably required by the changes or events. In the event (a) of a stock dividend or stock split or (b) Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the target Award opportunity shall be equitably adjusted. In the event other changes or events relating to the Shares fundamentally change the value of the Shares, then the Committee may make, in its sole discretion, such adjustments in the terms of the Award as the Committee may determine is equitably required by the change or event.
9. Discretionary Adjustment Following Certain Events.
The Award shall not confer upon you any rights whatsoever other than those expressly set forth herein, in the Plan or in policies adopted by the Committee, including without limitation any rights as a shareholder in respect of Shares that may become issuable pursuant to the Award until and unless Applied has issued a certificate or certificates for the Shares. Nothing in the Terms shall (i) interfere with or limit in any way Applied's right to terminate your employment at any
10. Limitation on Rights.

. The Award and the rights granted thereunder are not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, and may not be otherwise disposed of by you, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
11. Nonassignability
. It is intended that payments under the Award are "short-term deferrals" (as is defined under Section 409A) and, therefore, exempted from coverage under Section 409A, and any interpretations of these Terms shall be consistent with this intent. Notwithstanding such intention, in the event that the Terms, or any portion thereof, and the Award, or any portion thereof, shall be deemed to be governed by Section 409A, such Terms and Award, or portion thereof, shall be interpreted, to the extent applicable, as complying with the provisions of Section 409A.
12. Section 409A Compliance
. The Committee shall have conclusive authority, subject to the express provisions of the Plan as in effect from time to time and the Terms, to construe the Terms and the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the Committee's judgment necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or the Terms in the manner and to the extent it deems expedient to carry the Plan into effect. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, the Terms and the Award shall be subject to all of the Plan's provisions in effect from time to time, which are incorporated herein by reference.
13. Committee Authority
. The Terms are subject to the provisions of the Plan and any administrative policies adopted by the Committee. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms and the Plan or such policies, the Plan and the policies, in that order, shall govern. Reference in the Terms to Applied shall include Applied's subsidiaries.
14. Relationship to the Plan
. The provisions of the Terms are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
15. Severability
. The granting of the Award hereunder shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agency, national securities exchange, or automated quotation system as may be required. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Terms, Applied shall not be obligated to issue, deliver or transfer any Shares, make any distribution of benefits under the Plan or the Terms, or take any other action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, the requirements of the Securities Act and Section 409A).
16. Requirements of Law
. All obligations of Applied under the Terms with respect to the Award shall be binding upon any successor to Applied, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all, or substantially all, of the business and/or assets of Applied. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, in the event any such successor does not agree to be bound by the Terms, the Award granted hereunder shall immediately become vested.
17. Successors
. The validity, construction, interpretation and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.

This press release contains statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as "see," "expect," "will," "guidance," and similar expressions. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Applied assumes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, or events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

(1) Applied uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
There were no LIFO layer liquidation benefits recognized for the quarter ended September 30, 2011, nor are any expected to be realized for the year ending June 30, 2012. We recorded $301 of LIFO layer liquidation benefits in the quarter ended September 30, 2010.

EXHIBIT 10.1
Authority
The annual Incentive Plan for Neil A. Schrimsher (the "Plan") is established by the Board's Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") under the 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "2007 LTPP").
Objective
The Plan's objective is to reward the participant for his contributions toward the achievement of Applied's business goals.
Plan Goals
The Committee shall establish the Plan's goals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of (i) a merger, a consolidation, an acquisition or divestiture, the issuance or repurchase of a substantial amount of capital stock, a reorganization or restructuring, or any other transaction or series of transactions, or (ii) asset write-downs, or litigation or claim judgments or settlements, or foreign exchange gains or losses, or (iii) changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, or (iv) other extraordinary nonrecurring items, then the Committee, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Plan goals, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be conferred, in such manner as the Committee determines is equitably required by the changes or events.
Eligibility for Awards
If Plan goals are met, to be eligible for an award under the Plan, a participant must comply with the terms and conditions of the 2007 LTPP. In addition, except as provided in the 2007 LTPP, the participant must be actively employed by Applied on the last day of the fiscal year, except that,
 
Plan awards are intended to create an incentive for participants to act in Applied's best interests. Notwithstanding anything in these terms to the contrary,
 
 
The provisions of this section are a fundamental term of the award.
Change in Control
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the participant's employment with Applied is terminated during the fiscal year, following any Change in Control of Applied, either by the participant for "Good Reason" or by Applied "Without Cause", then the award shall be deemed to be earned at the target incentive value, prorated based on the number of calendar days elapsed in the fiscal year through the date of termination.
For purposes of this award, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by the participant to perform substantially the participant's duties with Applied or one of its affiliates (other than for disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the participant by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of Applied which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the participant has not substantially performed the participant's duties, or (ii) the willful engagement by the participant in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to Applied;
, that no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without the participant's reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of Applied. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given the participant pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of Applied or based upon the advice of counsel for Applied shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of Applied. Termination of the participant's employment with Applied shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the participant and the participant is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the participant is guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
provided, however
For purposes of this award, "Good Reason" shall mean (i) a material diminution in the participant's authority, duties, or responsibilities, (ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom the participant reported immediately prior to a Change in Control, (iii) a material diminution by Applied of the annual base salary that was provided to the participant by Applied immediately prior to the Change in Control, (iv) a material change in the geographic location where the participant provides service to Applied, or (v) any failure of any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Applied, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the participant, to expressly assume and agree to comply with the terms of this award in the same manner and to the same extent that Applied would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; , that, Good Reason shall not have occurred unless the participant gives Applied notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by the participant in good faith to constitute Good Reason and Applied has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition. For purposes of this award, "Good Reason" shall not exist if you have given your prior written consent to any of the events that would otherwise constitute "Good Reason".
provided further
Notwithstanding the definition in the Plan, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall have occurred for purposes of this award (to the extent this award does not constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A) when any of the following events shall occur:
(i) Applied is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock (as that term is hereafter defined) of Applied immediately prior to such transaction;
(ii) Applied sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, and, immediately after such sale, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of Applied immediately prior to such sale;
(iii) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of Applied ("Voting Stock");
(iv) Applied files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of Applied has occurred pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(v) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the directors of Applied cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (v), each director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by Applied's stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of Applied (or a committee thereof) then still in office who were directors of Applied at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of Applied at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of (iii) or (iv) hereof, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this award solely because (i) Applied, (ii) an entity in which Applied directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Applied-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of Applied, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule TO, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 30% or otherwise, or because Applied reports that a change in control of Applied has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to limit any economic benefit to which the participant is entitled under this award or the Plan.
To the extent this award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of Applied or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Applied that constitutes a "change in control" under Section 409A.
Other
The Committee has the authority to construe the Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations, in the Committee's judgment, necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration.
The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency with respect to the Plan in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under these provisions shall be conclusive for all purposes.
The provisions of these terms and conditions are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
The validity, construction, interpretation, and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
Applied has made no warranties or representations to the participant with respect to the tax consequences (including but not limited to income tax consequences) related to the Plan, and the participant has been advised to consult with the participant's attorney, accountant and/or tax advisor regarding the Plan. Moreover, the participant acknowledges that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for the participant.

Mr. Neil A. Schrimsher

Fayetteville, GA 30215
Dear Neil:
As a material inducement to you joining Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (the "Company"), the parties desire to set forth in this Severance Agreement (the "Agreement") their mutual agreements concerning the terms and conditions of any severance benefits in the event your employment with the Company is terminated within a year of the date hereof (the "Term"), subject to automatic annual renewal each year unless the Company gives you written notice 30 days in advance of expiration of the Term (as the same may be renewed from time-to time) of the Company's election not to renew, as determined in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board"), including its duly authorized committees.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent either you or the Company from terminating your employment at any time, for cause or otherwise, subject only to the specific payment, if any, and other provisions hereinafter set forth in this Agreement.
The Company hereby agrees to employ you, and you agree to serve, as the Company's Chief Executive Officer during the Term (as the same may be renewed), subject to the supervisory powers of the Board. In the event your employment with the Company is terminated, the parties hereby agree that (a) you shall be entitled to severance payments from the Company only to the extent specifically provided for herein and (b) the Company's obligation to make any severance payments to you hereunder shall be conditioned upon your satisfaction of all terms and conditions relating to such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if your employment with the Company is terminated for any reason, you shall be entitled to payment of all compensation and benefits earned and fully vested through your Date of Termination (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with the terms of any plan, agreement or terms and conditions relating to such compensation or benefits and that no such amount shall be deemed to be a severance payment.
1.
Employment.
2. Severance Payment Amount.
(a) If your employment with the Company is terminated within the Term (as the same may be extended by renewal), either by you for Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause, you shall be entitled to a severance payment equal to (i) your full base salary that would have been payable to you from your Date of Termination through the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement (or the latest renewal date hereof) (the "Severance Period"), at the highest rate in effect at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and (ii) 100% of your targeted annual incentive payment that would have been payable to you from your Date of Termination through the Severance Period, at the highest rate in effect at any time on or after the date of this Agreement, prorated based on the number of calendar days remaining during the Severance Period. You acknowledge that no severance payment shall be due under this Agreement to the extent you receive or are legally entitled to receive severance payments under any other agreement, plan or arrangement with the Company; provided, however, you may give notice to the Company of your election to decline severance payments hereunder in favor of severance payments under any other agreement, plan or arrangement with the Company or to accept severance payments hereunder and, thereby, decline severance payments under any other agreement, plan or arrangement with the Company.
(b) For purposes of this Agreement the term "Without Cause" shall mean termination of your employment for reasons other than your death, Retirement, Disability or Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
(i) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than for Disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or
(ii) the willful engagement by you in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this Section 2(b), no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without your reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given you pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. Termination of your employment with the Company shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to you and you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail;
(i) a material diminution in your authority, duties, or responsibilities;
(ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom you reported immediately prior to the Effective Date;
(iii) a material diminution by the Company of your annual base salary that was provided to you by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Date; or
(iv) a material change in the geographic location where you provide service to the Company
provided that, for purposes of this Section 2(c), Good Reason shall be interpreted to comply with Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(n)(2)(ii) and shall not have occurred unless you give the Company notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by you in good faith to constitute Good Reason and the Company has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition and provided further that such separation from service occurs no later than six months after one or more of the conditions constituting "Good Reason" occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall not exist if you have given your prior written consent to any of the events that would otherwise constitute "Good Reason".
(d) For purposes of this Agreement, except in the case of death, your "Date of Termination") shall be the earlier of the date specified by either you or the Company in a written notice of termination to the other party hereto or the date that you incur a Separation from Service for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder ("Section 409A").

Form and Time of Severance Payment
 
 
(i) .

Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) shall be paid within the first five business days following your Date of Termination and the remaining portion of your severance payment shall be made on the first day of the seventh calendar month following your Date of Termination. Each payment of your severance payment made hereunder shall be deemed to be a separate payment for purposes of applying the provisions of Section 409A.
Specified Employee
(ii) . If you are not a Specified Employee on your Date of Termination, the Company will pay the amount described in Section 2(a) hereof within the first five business days following your Date of Termination.
Not Specified Employee

In the event more than one plan, agreement, award or other arrangement with the Company contains covenants of a similar subject matter to those set forth in Section 14 of the Offer of Employment, the most favorable provisions to the Company of each such covenant, taken as a whole, shall govern.
5.
Nonmerger of Restrictive Covenants.
The Company's obligation to make any payment under Section 2(a) of this Agreement shall be conditioned upon your delivering, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Company, a release of all claims or causes of action that may have arisen out of your employment or the termination of his employment, any transaction, or any state of facts existing on or prior to the Date of Termination, including, but not limited to, any and all claims and causes of action arising under any severance plan, policy, or practice of the Company, against the Company or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, assigns, shareholders, employees, insurers, officers, directors, or agents, be they common law or statutory, legal or equitable, in contract or tort including claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Fair Labor Standards, Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the fair employment practices acts and all other employment laws of the various states arising out of or relating in any way to your employment with the Company or the termination of that employment.

October 25, 2011
Mr. Neil Schrimsher
320 Highgrove Drive
Fayetteville, GA 30215
Dear Neil:
Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (the "Company") considers it essential to the best interest of the Company and its shareholders that the Company's management be encouraged to remain with the Company and to continue to devote their full attention to the Company's business. The Company recognizes that the possibility of a change in control of the Company may exist and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of key members of the Company's management, including you, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company.
In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company until the termination of your employment in conjunction with a "Change in Control" of the Company (as defined in Section 2 hereof), this letter agreement ("Agreement") sets forth the severance benefits that the Company agrees will be provided to you in the event your employment with the Company is terminated within the two year period immediately following any change in control of the Company either by you for "Good Reason" or by the Company "Without Cause" (both as defined in Section 3 hereof). In the event that a change in control of the Company does not occur, your severance benefits, if any, shall be determined without regard to this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall be construed so as to prevent either you or the Company from terminating your employment at any time, for cause or otherwise, subject only to the specific payment and other provisions hereinafter set forth in this Agreement in the event that a Change in Control of the Company occurs prior to the date your termination becomes effective. In addition, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated, and of no further force and effect, in the event that you cease to be a Board-elected officer or an appointed officer of the Company prior to a Change in Control. You hereby specifically acknowledge that your employment by the Company is employment-at-will, subject to termination by you, or by the Company, at any time with or without cause. You also acknowledge that such employment-at-will status cannot be modified except in a specific writing that has been authorized or ratified by the Board.
1. . The parties agree that you have advised the Company that, in consideration of, among other things, the Company's entering into this Agreement with you, it is your present intention to remain in the employ of the Company unless and until there occurs a Change in Control.
Continued Employment
2. . No benefits shall be payable hereunder unless a Change in Control occurs and your employment with the Company is terminated within two years thereafter either by you for Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause. This Agreement is not intended to apply to termination of your employment by reason of Death, Disability or Retirement (as defined in Section 3 hereof). For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" of the Company shall mean:
Change in Control
(a) The Company is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock (as that term is hereafter defined) of the Company immediately prior to such transaction;
(b) The Company sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, and, immediately after such sale, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of the Company immediately prior to such sale;
(c) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company ("Voting Stock");
(d) The Company files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of the Company has occurred or will occur in the future pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(e) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period are the directors of the Company cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that for purposes of this subparagraph (e), each director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by the Company's shareholders, by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) then still in
office who were directors of the Company at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of the Company at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the events specified in subparagraphs (c) and (d) above, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred solely because (i) the Company, (ii) an entity in which the Company directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Company-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of the Company, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule TO, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 30% or otherwise, or because the Company reports that a change in control of the Company has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
The first date upon which a Change in Control takes place shall be known as the "Effective Date." Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Change in Control occurs and if your employment with the Company is terminated prior to the date on which the Change in Control occurs, and if it is reasonably demonstrated by you that such termination (i) was at the request of a third party who had taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in Control or (ii) was by the Company and arose with or in anticipation of a Change in Control, then for all purposes of this Agreement, your employment shall be deemed to have been terminated by the Company Without Cause under Section 3(f) of this Agreement and the "Effective Date" shall mean the date immediately prior to the Date of Termination (as defined in Section 3 hereof).
3. . Your employment with the Company shall or may be terminated, as the case may be, for any of the following reasons; provided that in each case such termination of employment constitutes a "separation from service" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations issued thereunder ("Separation from Service"):
Termination of Employment
(a) . Termination of your employment with the Company due to your death;
Death
(b) . Termination of your employment with the Company at or after the attainment of age sixty-five (65);
Retirement
(c) . Termination of your employment with the Company either by you or the Company after you are physically or mentally incapacitated for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days such that you cannot substantially perform your duties of employment with the Company on a full-time basis;
Disability
(d) . Termination of your employment with the Company at any time for Cause. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean:
Cause
(i) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your duties with the Company or one of its affiliates (other than for Disability or Good
Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or
(ii) the willful engagement by you in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company.
For purposes of this Section 3(d), no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without your reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given you pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. Termination of your employment with the Company shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to you and you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail;
(e)(A) . You may separate from service with the Company for 409A Good Reason, provided that the notice and cure requirements set forth below are satisfied and provided further that such separation from service occurs no later than two years after one or more of the conditions constituting "409A Good Reason" occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, "409A Good Reason" shall mean:
409A Good Reason
(i) a material diminution in your authority, duties, or responsibilities;
(ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom you reported immediately prior to the Effective Date;
(iii) a material diminution by the Company of your annual base salary that was provided to you by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Date;
(iv) a material change in the geographic location where you provide service to the Company; or
(v) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 11 of this Agreement;
provided that, for purposes of this Section 3(e), 409A Good Reason shall not have occurred unless you give the Company notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition
claimed by you in good faith to constitute 409A Good Reason and the Company has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition.
(B) . You may terminate your employment with the Company for Other Good Reason. For purposes of this Agreement, "Other Good Reason" shall mean:
Other Good Reason
(i) the assignment of any duties inconsistent in any respect with your position (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements), authority, duties or responsibilities, or any other action by the Company which results in a diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities, excluding for this purpose an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent action not taken in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after receipt of notice thereof given by you;
(ii) any failure by the Company to continue to provide you with an annual base salary, employee benefits and an opportunity to earn incentive and bonus compensation equal or greater to that which was provided to you by the Company immediately prior to the Effective Date other than an isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure not occurring in bad faith and which is remedied by the Company promptly after the receipt of notice thereof given by you;
(iii) the Company's requiring you to be based at or generally work from any location other than the location that you were based at or generally worked from prior to the Effective Date or the Company's requiring you to travel on Company business to a substantially greater extent than required immediately prior to the Effective Date; or
(iv) any failure by the Company to comply with and satisfy Section 11 of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Section 3(e)(B), your good faith determination of "Other Good Reason" shall be conclusiveYou shall specify in your notice of separation from service with the Company under Section 3(e)(A) or termination of employment under Section 3(e)(B) whether your separation or termination is for 409A Good Reason or Other Good Reason. If you fail to specify whether your notice is given pursuant to Section 3(e)(A) or Section 3(e)(B), the Company will presume that the notice is given pursuant to Section 3(e)(B). Collectively, 409A Good Reason and Other Good Reason may be collectively referred to herein as "Good Reason." For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall not exist if you have given your prior written consent to any of the events that would otherwise constitute "Good Reason".
.
(f) . The Company may terminate your employment with the Company Without Cause. For purposes of this Agreement the term "Without Cause" shall mean termination of your employment for reasons other than for Death, Retirement, Disability or Cause. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if, at any time prior to a Change in Control of the Company, you receive notice from the Company that you will be terminated Without Cause and will receive severance benefits under another arrangement between you and the Company, no benefits shall be payable to you hereunder.
Without Cause

Amount of Severance Pay
(i) (A) your full base salary earned through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect ten days prior to the date Notice of Termination is given, to the extent not theretofore paid and (B) 100% of your targeted annual incentive payment for the Company's fiscal year during which your Date of Termination occurs, prorated based on the number of calendar days elapsed in such fiscal year through the Date of Termination;

(iii) in lieu of annual incentive compensation, commissions, and bonuses that would otherwise be payable, an amount equal to the product of (1) your target annual incentive compensation, commissions, and bonuses (excluding amounts realized from the exercise of any stock options or SARs), based on the deemed achievement of performance goals at the 100% level, for the then-current fiscal year of the Company and (2) the lesser of the number three or a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months from and including the month in which the Date of Termination occurs to and including the month in which you would attain the age sixty-five and the denominator of which is twelve; and

provided, however, in the event it is determined that any payment or distribution to or for your benefit, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement or similar right (a "Payment"), would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any successor provision thereto), or any interest or penalties with respect to such excise tax (such excise tax, together with any such interest and penalties, are hereafter collectively referred to as the "Excise Tax"), then in lieu of such Payments, you shall be entitled to elect to receive the greatest amount of Payments to which you are entitled without triggering the Excise Tax and Applied will reasonably cooperate with you in designating those particular types of Payments (e.g., welfare benefits, cash compensation, or outplacement benefits) that shall be paid and those that shall be forfeited or rescinded so as to avoid triggering the Excise Tax.

,
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5(a), to the extent that any welfare benefits involve reimbursements or in-kind benefits:
(i) The amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement and the provision of in-kind benefits during any calendar year shall not affect the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement or the provision of in-kind benefits in any other calendar year;
(ii) The reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred; and
(iii) The right to reimbursement or right to in-kind benefit shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

6. . If a Change in Control of the Company occurs and within two years thereafter your employment with the Company is terminated either by you for Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause, then the Company shall provide you reasonable outplacement services for a period of up to one year of a nature customarily provided at your executive officer level.
Outplacement Services
7. . You shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in Section 4 or 5 by seeking other employment or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may own less than one percent of the combined voting power of all issued and outstanding voting securities of any publicly held corporation whose stock is traded on a major stock exchange.
Noncompetition, Nonsolicitation and Nondisparagement
9. . You hereby agree that you shall not at any time (whether employed by the Company or not), either directly or indirectly, disclose or make known to any person or entity any confidential information, trade secret, or proprietary information that you acquired during the course of your employment with the Company which shall not have become public knowledge (other than by your actions in violation of this Agreement). You further agree that upon the termination of your employment with the Company or at any time upon the request of the Company you shall deliver to the Company any and all literature, documents, correspondence, and other materials and records furnished to or acquired by you from the Company during the course of your employment with the Company. In no event shall an asserted violation of the provisions of this Section 9 constitute a basis for deferring or withholding any amounts otherwise payable to you under this Agreement.
Confidential Information
10. . To secure payment of the benefits herein provided for, the Company agrees to maintain in the Company's name an irrevocable escrow account in the form of an unfunded rabbi trust (the "Escrow Account") at a national bank that is (a) a legal business entity organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, in good standing, having an office in the State of Ohio, that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and that has at the time of its appointment a combined capital and surplus of at least One Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000) or (b) an affiliate of a national bank described in clause (a) of this sentence (the "Bank"), and to keep on deposit in the Escrow Account cash, securities or property with a fair market value, if any, as shall at all times be at least equal to the required security hereinafter provided for. The maximum amount of required security to be kept on deposit at any time shall be (A) an amount equal to three times your annualized Base Compensation (defined as your annual base salary and your target annual incentive compensation (based on achievement of performance goals at the 100% level)), with such amount to be recalculated each November to reflect changes in your annualized Base Compensation, or (B) if there has been a determination with your written consent or by a final arbitral award rendered in accordance with this Agreement that a specific lesser amount fully secures the Company's obligations under this Agreement, or that the Company has fully performed its obligations under this Agreement, then such specific lesser amount or, in the case that the Company has fully performed its obligations under this Agreement, nothing. The full maximum amount of required security shall be kept on deposit at all times after there shall have been a Change in Control. Unless and until such a Change in Control shall have occurred, however, the Company shall only be obliged to maintain on deposit in the Escrow Account 50% of the maximum amount of required security. Amounts deposited in the Escrow Account shall be paid out by the Bank only to you, in such amounts as the Company shall certify in good faith to the Bank as amounts that the Company is in default in paying to you under this Agreement, or to the Company, to the extent that the amount on deposit exceeds the maximum amount of required security as specified by the Company in good faith to the Bank or in a final settlement or judgment relating to this Agreement.
Security
11. . The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to you, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession that constitutes a Change in Control shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle you to compensation from the Company, upon a termination by you for Other Good Reason in accordance with Section 3(e)(B), in the same amount and on the same terms as you would be entitled hereunder under Section 4. As used in this Agreement "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 11 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees. If you should die while any amounts would still be payable to you hereunder if you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisees, legatees, or other designee or, if there be no such designee, to your estate within 90 days of your death; provided that where such 90-day period begins in one calendar year and
Successors, Binding Agreement
ends in another calendar year, your devisees, legatees, other designee, or estate shall not be entitled to designate the taxable year of payment.
12. . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere contained in this Agreement, if you cease to be a Board-elected officer or an appointed officer of the Company prior to a Change in Control, this Agreement shall be deemed terminated and of no further force and effect.
Continued Status as Elected Officer or Appointed Officer
13. . Notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed by United States registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed to the respective addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement, provided that all notices to the Company shall be directed to the attention of the Secretary of the Company, or to such other address as either party may have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith, except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.
Notice
14. . No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by you and such officer as may be specifically designated by the Board; provided, that the Company shall have the right to terminate its obligations to you under this Agreement by written notice given to you at any time prior to a Change in Control, so long as such termination is not done in anticipation of or in connection with a Change in Control. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and you with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except to the extent a specific compensation program provides for benefits upon a Change in Control relative to that program, which provisions shall remain in effect, no agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this Agreement supersedes and replaces in its entirety any prior agreement relating to the subject matter hereof. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.
Miscellaneous
15. . The invalidity or unenforceability of any one or more provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
Validity
16. . This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
Counterparts
17. . In the event of any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement, you and the Company hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the Common
Jurisdiction
Pleas Court of the State of Ohio (Cuyahoga County) or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
18. .
Legal Fees and Expenses
(a) It is the intent of the Company that you shall not be required to incur the expenses associated with the enforcement of your rights under this Agreement by arbitration, litigation, other legal action or negotiation to resolve any disputes because the cost and expenses thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to you hereunder. Accordingly, if it should appear to you that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event the Company or any other person takes any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any arbitration or litigation designed to deny, or to recover from, you the benefits intended to be provided to you hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes you from time to time to retain counsel of your choice, at the expense of the Company, to represent you in connection with the initiation or defense of any arbitration, litigation, other legal action or negotiation to resolve any disputes whether by or against the Company or any director, officer, shareholder or other person affiliated with the Company, in any jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any existing or prior attorney-client relationship between the Company and such counsel, the Company irrevocably consents to your entering into an attorney-client relationship with such counsel, and in that connection the Company and you agree that a confidential relationship shall exist between you and such counsel. The Company shall also pay or cause to be paid and shall be solely responsible for any and all attorneys' and related fees and expenses incurred by you as a result of the Company's failure to perform this Agreement or any provision hereof (including this Section 18) or as a result of the Company or any person contesting the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
(b) The payment or reimbursement of fees and expenses under this Section 18 shall be subject to the following conditions:
(i) You must incur any expense authorized by this Section 18 no later than three years after the Date of Termination;
(ii) The amount eligible for reimbursement and the provision of in-kind benefits during any calendar year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement or the provision of in-kind benefits in any other calendar year;
(iii) The reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made on or before December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred; and
(iv) The right to reimbursement or right to in-kind benefit shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 18, if at the Date of Termination you are a Specified Employee, no payment or reimbursement shall be provided under Section 18
prior to the first day that is six months after the Date of Termination; provided that the Specified Employee six-month delay under this Section 18 shall be effective only to the extent that payment or reimbursement would constitute "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A. Any payment or reimbursement otherwise due under this Section 18 and subject to the Specified Employee six-month delay shall commence within the first five business days after the expiration of such six-month delay. Any payment or reimbursement that is not "nonqualified deferred compensation" under Section 409A or not subject to the Specified Employee six-month delay shall be paid or reimbursed as otherwise provided herein.
19. . No benefit under this Agreement shall at any time be subject in any manner to alienation or encumbrance. If you attempt to, or shall, alienate or in any way encumber your rights or benefits under the Agreement, or any part thereof, or if by reason of his bankruptcy or other event happening at any time any such benefits would otherwise be received by anyone else or would not be enjoyed by you, your interest in all such benefits shall automatically terminate and the same shall be held or applied to or for the benefit of such person, his spouse, children, or other dependents as the Company may select.
Non-Alienation
20. . The Company (or any agent of the Company) shall report all income required to be reported, and withhold from any payment under the Agreement the amount of withholding taxes due, in the opinion of the Company, in respect of such income or payment and shall take any other action as may be necessary, in the opinion of the Company, to satisfy all obligations for the reporting of such income and payment of such taxes. Except as specifically provided herein, the Company shall not be held liable for any taxes, penalties, interest, or other monetary amounts owed by a Participant or other person, including any taxes, penalties, and/or interest under Section 409A, as a result of the payment or deferral of any amounts under the Agreement. Although the Company shall use its best efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, penalties, and/or interest under Section 409A, tax treatment of payment under this Agreement is not warranted or guaranteed.
Taxes
21. This Agreement is intended to be treated as an unfunded deferred compensation arrangement under the Code. The obligation of the Company shall constitute the unsecured promise of the Company to make payments as provided herein, and no person shall have any interest in, or a lien or prior claim upon, any property of the Company.
If this letter correctly sets forth our agreement on the subject matter hereof, kindly sign and return to the Company the enclosed copy of the letter which will then constitute our agreement on this subject.

vested at the end of the Restriction Period in a pro rata portion of the RSUs equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the number of fiscal quarters (including a portion of a quarter) elapsed in the Restriction Period prior to the date of such Separation from Service and the denominator of which is twelve.
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, but subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) hereunder, if, during any Restriction Period, you incur a Separation from Service (as defined in Section 409A) from Applied due to death or "Disability" (as defined under Section 409A) then (i) you (or your beneficiary designated to Applied in writing) shall be vested in 100% of the RSUs awarded to you hereunder. In the event, however, that you, during the Restriction Period, incur a Separation from Service from Applied for any reason other than (i) those specifically set forth above or in Section 6, or (ii) termination after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, then the portion of the award of RSUs hereunder still subject to a Restriction Period shall be forfeited and no amount shall be due or payable to you under the Terms.
5.
Separation from Service
Because awards of RSUs are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests, notwithstanding anything in the Terms to the contrary:
(a) Your award of RSUs may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends, distributions, and Dividend Equivalents thereon) issued pursuant to the award of RSUs hereunder within the previous six months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending six months following the your Separation from Service, you committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers, or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, or vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective as of the time of your act.
(b) The Committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends, distributions, and Dividend Equivalents thereon) issued pursuant to the award of RSUs hereunder within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (I) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (II) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (x) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (y) your earnings pursuant to the award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 4 and 5, in the event your employment with Applied is terminated during the Restriction Period and within the two year period immediately following any Change in Control of Applied either by you for "Good Reason" or by Applied "Without Cause", then all of the RSUs awarded hereunder to you shall be 100% vested.
6.
Change in Control
For purposes of the RSUs, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your duties with Applied or one of its affiliates (other than for Disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of Applied which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or (ii) the willful engagement by you in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to Applied; , that no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without your reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of Applied. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given you pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the
provided, however
Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of Applied or based upon the advice of counsel for Applied shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of Applied. Termination of your employment with Applied shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to you and you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
For purposes of the RSUs, "Good Reason" shall mean a separation from service that occurs no later than two years after (i) a material diminution in your authority, duties, or responsibilities, (ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom you reported immediately prior to a Change in Control, (iii) a material diminution by Applied of your annual base salary that was provided to you by Applied immediately prior to the Change in Control, (iv) a material change in the geographic location where you provide service to Applied, or (v) any failure of any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Applied, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to you, to expressly assume and agree to comply with these Terms in the same manner and to the same extent that Applied would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; , that, Good Reason shall not have occurred unless you give Applied notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by you in good faith to constitute Good Reason and Applied has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall not exist if you have given your prior written consent to any of the events that would otherwise constitute "Good Reason".
provided further
Notwithstanding the definition in the Plan, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall have occurred for purposes of the RSUs (to the extent the RSUs do not constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A) when any of the following events shall occur:
(i) Applied is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock (as that term is hereafter defined) of Applied immediately prior to such transaction;
(ii) Applied sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, and, immediately after such sale, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of Applied immediately prior to such sale;
(iii) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of Applied ("Voting Stock");
(iv) Applied files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any
successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of Applied has occurred pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(v) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the directors of Applied cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (v), each director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by Applied's stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of Applied (or a committee thereof) then still in office who were directors of Applied at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of Applied at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of (iii) or (iv) hereof, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Award solely because (i) Applied, (ii) an entity in which Applied directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Applied-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of Applied, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule TO, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 30% or otherwise, or because Applied reports that a change in control of Applied has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled with respect to the RSUs or under the Plan.
To the extent the RSUs constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of Applied or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Applied that constitutes a "change in control" under Section 409A.
In addition, to the extent the RSUs are subject to Section 409A, Shares will be issued and distributed to you within 90 calendar days after vesting; provided that if such 90-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, you shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution due to a separation from service may not be made until the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of your death, except in each case as may be otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
. In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, exchange, spin-off, spin-out, or other distribution of assets to shareholders, or other similar event or change in capitalization such that shares of Applied common stock are changed into or become exchangeable for a different number of shares, thereafter the number of RSUs will be increased or decreased, as the case may be, in direct proportion to the increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock by reason of such change in corporate structure; provided, however, that the number of RSUs shall always be a whole number. If there occurs a stock split, combination, reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, as a result of which shares of Applied common stock are converted solely into cash or the right to receive cash, then the RSUs shall thereafter be converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the cash that the number of shares of Applied common stock corresponding to the RSU would be
7.
Adjustment of RSUs for Certain Events
converted. If there occurs any other change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of common stock or other Applied securities, or of any shares of stock or other securities into which such shares of common stock shall have been changed or for which they shall have been exchanged, then Applied may adjust the number or kind of RSUs or other securities into which the RSUs may be settled, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine is equitable, and such adjustment so made shall be effective and binding for all purposes.
. Your award of RSUs hereunder shall be settled in whole Shares. Fractional Shares shall not be issuable hereunder and any fractional Share shall be disregarded. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Section 8, Shares subject to an award of RSUs hereunder shall only be issued and distributed to you in a single sum of whole Shares within the 75-day period after the end of the Restriction Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that your RSUs become vested due to death, Disability or a Change in Control, the award of RSUs hereunder shall be settled in a single sum of whole Shares within the 75-day period after such vesting. In the event that any such 75-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, you (or your beneficiary as the case may be) shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Moreover, notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution of Shares may not be made until within the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following the month of any Separation from Service for reasons other than Disability or a Change in Control, or, if earlier, your death, except as maybe otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
8.
Settlement of Award and Distribution of Shares
. Upon the vesting of the RSUs, Applied shall withhold Shares from your award for any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by Applied attributable to the award.
9.
Payment of Taxes
. To the extent applicable, it is intended the Terms and the award of RSUs shall comply with or be exempt from the provisions of Section 409A and any interpretations of these terms shall be consistent with such intent.
10.
Section 409A Compliance
. The Committee shall have conclusive authority, subject to the express provisions of the Plan as in effect from time to time and the Terms, to construe the Terms and the Plan, and to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Terms in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect, and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. Applied's Board of Directors (the "Board") may from time to time grant to the Committee such further powers and authority as the Board shall determine to be necessary or desirable. Notwithstanding any other provision of these terms, any amendment, construction, establishment, rescission or correction of the type referred to above which is made or adopted following a Change in Control, and which amendment, construction, establishment or correction adversely affects your rights hereunder, shall be in writing and shall be effective only with your express and prior written consent .
11.
Administration of the Plan
. The Terms are subject to the provisions of the Plan and any administrative policies adopted by the Committee. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms and the Plan or such policies, the Plan and the policies, in that order, shall govern. References in the Terms to Applied shall include Applied's subsidiaries.
12.
Relationship to the Plan
. The provisions of the Terms are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
13.
Severability
. The Terms and your award shall not confer upon you any rights whatsoever other than those expressly set forth herein, in the Plan or in policies adopted by the
14.
No Guarantee of Employment
Committee. Nothing in the Terms shall (i) interfere with or limit in any way Applied's right to terminate your employment at any time, (ii) confer upon you any right to continued employment with Applied, or (iii) create any contractual or other right to receive additional awards or other Plan benefits in the future.
. The granting of the RSUs hereunder shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agency, national securities exchange, or automated quotation system may be required. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Terms, Applied shall not be obligated to issue, deliver or transfer any Shares, make any distribution of benefits under the Plan or the Terms, or take any other action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, the requirements of the Securities Act and Section 409A).
15.
Requirements of Law
. All obligations of Applied under the Terms with respect to the RSUs shall be binding upon any successor to Applied, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all, or substantially all, of the business and/or assets of Applied. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, in the event any such successor does not agree to be bound by the Terms, the RSUs granted hereunder shall immediately become vested.
16.
Successors
. The validity, construction, interpretation and enforceability of these Terms shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
17.
Applicable Law
. Applied has made no warranties or representations to you with respect to the tax consequences (including but not limited to income tax consequences) related to the RSUs or the issuance, transfer or disposition of Shares pursuant to the RSUs, and you have been advised to consult with your attorney, accountant and/or tax advisor regarding the RSUs. Moreover, you acknowledge that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for you.

Tax Matters
(October 2011)

EXHIBIT 10.5
Your Stock Appreciation Rights Award (the "SARs" or the "Award") is made by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Applied"). For purposes of these terms and conditions, employment by a parent, subsidiary, or an affiliate of Applied shall be considered employment by Applied.
The Award is governed by Applied's 2007 Long-Term Performance Plan (the "Plan"), including the policies adopted by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of Applied's Board of Directors (the "Committee") under the Plan, and these terms and conditions. Upon valid exercise, the Award entitles you to receive such number of shares of Applied common stock ("Shares") that have a fair market value equal to the difference (if positive) between the fair market value of (a) a Share on the date of exercise over (b) the Base Price, multiplied by (c) the number of Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised, subject to the following conditions:
1. Grant of SARs; Exercisability.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2 and 7, below, your Award will be exercisable only if and after you have remained in Applied's continuous employ from the Award's grant date (the "Grant Date") to the vesting date of all or the specified portion of your Award. Your Award will vest with respect to 100% of the aggregate number of Shares to which it relates upon the earlier of (x) three years of continuous employment from the Grant Date or (y) the date your employment with Applied is terminated, either by you for "Good Reason" (as hereinafter defined but, for purposes of this section, after eliminating references in such definitions to "immediately prior to a Change in Control") or by the Company "Without Cause." The term "Without Cause" shall mean termination of your employment by Applied for reasons other than your death, Retirement, Disability or Cause (each, as hereinafter defined).
(b) Except as otherwise provided, your Award shall expire at the end of the 10-year period commencing with the Grant Date (the "Term"), or upon such earlier expiration or your separation from service date as may be provided by Sections 2 and 7 below. The SARs shall not be exercisable thereafter.
If, during the Term, you incur a separation from service from Applied for any reason, you may exercise your SARs, to the extent you were entitled to exercise them immediately prior to your separation from service, at any time within three months after your separation from service (but only during the Term); , that (i) if you Retire, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within three years after your retirement (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; (ii) if you incur a separation from service due to your permanent and total disability, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your separation from service (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; and (iii) if you die while employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your death (but only during the Term), the person entitled by will or applicable law to exercise the SARs may do so.
2. Termination of SARs.
provided, however
Awards are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests.
Notwithstanding anything in these terms to the contrary,
 
 
The provisions of this section are a fundamental term of the Award.
During your life, your Award may be exercised only by you, your guardian, or legal representative. Upon your death, your Award may be exercised by the person entitled by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
3. Method of Exercise; Rights of Holder.
Your SARs may be exercised by delivering to Applied at its principal executive offices (directed to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Secretary) a written notice (which may include facsimile transmission or electronic mail), signed by you or such other person entitled to exercise the SARs, of the election to exercise the SARs and stating the number of Shares as to which the SARs are being exercised. The SARs shall be deemed exercised as of the date Applied receives the notice. If the SARs are exercised, as provided herein, by any person other than you, the notice shall be accompanied by appropriate evidence of that person's right to exercise the SARs. As a condition to your valid exercise of the SARs, you hereby consent to Applied withholding from the Shares issuable upon exercise (if any), such number of Shares the fair market value of which Applied determines to be equal to the amount required to be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state or local law, including tax withholding requirements. Promptly following the proper exercise of the SARs, Applied shall issue in the name of the person exercising the SARs, a certificate representing the Shares due hereunder. Your SARs may be exercised only with respect to a whole number of Shares, and may not be exercised in fractional amounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and the restrictions on exercise contained in Section 2, if, in the event your employment with Applied is terminated within the two-year period immediately following any Change in Control of Applied either by you for "Good Reason" or by Applied "Without Cause", then your SARs then outstanding shall become fully exercisable as of the date immediately prior to the date of termination of your employment.
For purposes of this Award, "Cause" shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by you to perform substantially your duties with Applied or one of its affiliates (other than for disability or Good Reason), after a
written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of Applied which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that you have not substantially performed your duties, or (ii) the willful engagement by you in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to Applied; , that no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without your reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of Applied. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given you pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of Applied or based upon the advice of counsel for Applied shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of Applied. Termination of your employment with Applied shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to you and you are given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, you are guilty of the conduct described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.
provided, however
For purposes of this Award, "Good Reason" shall mean a separation from service that occurs no later than two years after (i) a material diminution in your authority, duties, or responsibilities, (ii) a material diminution in the authority, duties, or responsibilities of the person to whom you reported immediately prior to a Change in Control, (iii) a material diminution by Applied of your annual base salary that was provided to you by Applied immediately prior to the Change in Control, (iv) a material change in the geographic location where you provide service to Applied, or (v) any failure of any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Applied, by agreement in form and substance satisfactory to you, to expressly assume and agree to comply with the terms of this Award in the same manner and to the same extent that Applied would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; , that, Good Reason shall not have occurred unless you give Applied notice within 90 days of the initial existence of the condition claimed by you in good faith to constitute Good Reason and Applied has at least 30 days in which to remedy the condition. For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall not exist if you have given your prior written consent to any of the events that would otherwise constitute "Good Reason".
provided further
Notwithstanding the definition in the Plan, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall have occurred for purposes of this Award (to the extent this Award does not constitute nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A) when any of the following events shall occur:
(i) Applied is merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another corporation or other legal person, and immediately after such merger, consolidation or reorganization less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such transaction are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock (as that term is hereafter defined) of Applied immediately prior to such transaction;
(ii) Applied sells all or substantially all of its assets to any other corporation or other legal person, and, immediately after such sale, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of such corporation or person immediately after such sale are held in the aggregate by the holders of Voting Stock of Applied immediately prior to such sale;
(iii) There is a report filed or required to be filed on Schedule 13D or Schedule TO (or any successor schedule, form or report), each as promulgated pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), disclosing that any person (as the term "person" is used in Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) has become the beneficial owner (as the term "beneficial owner" is defined under Rule 13d-3 or any successor rule or regulation promulgated under the Exchange Act) of securities representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of Applied ("Voting Stock");
(iv) Applied files a report or proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Exchange Act disclosing in response to Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) that a change in control of Applied has occurred pursuant to any then-existing contract or transaction; or
(v) If during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of any such period constitute the directors of Applied cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, provided, however, that for purposes of this clause (v), each director who is first elected, or first nominated for election by Applied's stockholders by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors of Applied (or a committee thereof) then still in office who were directors of Applied at the beginning of any such period will be deemed to have been a director of Applied at the beginning of such period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of Section (iii) or (iv) hereof, unless otherwise determined in a specific case by majority vote of the Board, a "Change in Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of this Award solely because (i) Applied, (ii) an entity in which Applied directly or indirectly beneficially owns 50% or more of the voting securities or interest, or (iii) any Applied-sponsored employee stock ownership plan or any other employee benefit plan of Applied, either files or becomes obligated to file a report or a proxy statement under or in response to Schedule 13D, Schedule TO, Form 8-K or Schedule 14A (or any successor schedule, form or report or item therein) under the Exchange Act, disclosing beneficial ownership by it of shares of Voting Stock, whether in excess of 30% or otherwise, or because Applied reports that a change in control of Applied has occurred or will occur in the future by reason of such beneficial ownership.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled under this Award or the Plan, including the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c) below. In the event of the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c), the provisions in Section 7 purporting to terminate your SARs shall not apply and you shall have the option either to exercise your rights under Section 7 or to deem the SARs assumed by the successor within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever is more favorable to you.
To the extent this Award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A, a "Change in Control" of Applied shall mean a change in the ownership or effective control of Applied or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of Applied that constitutes a "change in control" under Section 409A.
In addition, to the extent this Award is subject to Section 409A, Shares will be issued and distributed to you within 90 calendar days after receipt by Applied of your written notice of exercise; provided that if such 90-day period begins in one calendar year and ends in another, you shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution due to a Separation from Service may not be made until the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following such Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of your death, except in each case as may be otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
As an SAR holder, you shall have absolutely no rights as a shareholder, whether before or after vesting of all or any portion of your Award.
Your SARs shall not be exercisable if such exercise or the issuance of Shares pursuant to your Award would violate:
4. Limitations on Exercise.
(a) Any state securities law;
(b) Any registration or other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any stock exchange's listing requirements; or
(c) Any other legal requirement of any governmental authority.
If your exercise of SARs is prevented by the terms of any of the foregoing subsections, and the Term of the SARs expires, then you may, within 30 days after Applied notifies you that your exercise is no longer prevented by this Section 4, exercise the SARs to the extent they would have been exercisable but for the operation of this Section 4.
Furthermore, if a registration statement with respect to Shares issuable upon exercise of the SARs is not in effect or if Applied's counsel otherwise deems it necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible violations of the Act, Applied may require, as a condition to its issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares, the delivery to Applied of a commitment in writing by the person exercising the SARs that (i) at the time of the exercise it is his intention to acquire the Shares for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof; (ii) the person understands that the Shares may be "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 issued under the Act; and (iii) any resale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares will be accomplished only in compliance with Rule 144, the Act, or other or subsequent rules and regulations thereunder. Applied may place on the certificates representing the Shares a legend reflecting that commitment and Applied may refuse to permit transfer of the Shares until it has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it that no violation of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would be involved in the transfer.
The Award is not a guaranty of employment or commitment by Applied of continued employment. Nothing in the Award or these terms and conditions alters, limits or restricts any right Applied would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of your employment.
5. No Guaranty of Employment.
The Award is not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, and may not be otherwise disposed of by you, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or with the prior written consent of Applied.
6. Nonassignability.
If (a) Applied is to be merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity so that Applied is not the surviving corporation and, immediately after such event, the holders of Shares immediately prior to the event hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity, (b) Applied is to be dissolved or liquidated, or (c) substantially all of Applied's assets are to be sold, then the Committee shall give you 30 days' prior written notice. Upon the giving of that notice, if you are employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully vested and exercisable. Within the 30-day period (but only during the Term), you shall have the right to exercise your SARs. Thereafter, notwithstanding any other provision of these terms and conditions, the SARs shall expire, unless "assumed" by another corporation within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
7. Liquidation, Dissolution, Merger, Sale of Substantially All Assets.
In the event (a) of a stock dividend or stock split or (b) the Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the Shares purchasable or the Base Price hereunder shall be equitably adjusted so that the SARs represent the right to acquire Shares or the number and kind of other securities that are economically equivalent to what the Shares would have represented had the SARs been fully exercised immediately preceding such event.

On December 19, 2011, the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied"), approved and adopted (i) the First Amendment (the "First Amendment") to the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Plan (Restated Post -2004 Terms) (the "SERP"), effective as of December 31, 2011 and (ii) the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. Key Executive Restoration Plan (the "KERP"), effective as of January 1, 2012. The First Amendment and KERP are attached to this Form 8-K as exhibits.
The First Amendment freezes participation in the SERP and ceases the accrual of additional plan benefits (both by virtue of years of service and compensation levels) to existing SERP participants, effective as of the close of business on December 31, 2011.
The KERP is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that was adopted as a replacement plan for the SERP, which generally provided more generous retirement or termination benefits to participants who met certain age and service requirements. To be eligible to participate in the KERP, a participant (each, a "Participant") must be a full-time, select management employee of Applied who is designated for participation in the KERP by the Committee or the Board. Under the KERP, Applied will credit a bookkeeping account for each Participant with an amount equal to (i) 6.25% (unless a different company contribution percentage is specified by the Committee or the Board) of the Participant's base salary and annual cash incentive pay minus (ii) the amount of any company contributions credited to the Participant under Applied's Retirement Savings Plan, a qualified 401(k) plan (the "RSP"), for such period. To be eligible to receive an allocation under the KERP, Participants must elect to make 401(k) contributions under the RSP of either 6% of compensation or the contribution limit applicable under the United States Internal Revenue Code and must be employed on the last day of a payment period or have retired, died, or become disabled during the payment period. Payment periods shall be designated by the Committee or the Board. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or the Board, credits to a Participant's account vest based on years of service of the Participant, 25% per year of service. In addition, a Participant will be 100% vested in the event of attainment of age 65, death, disability, or certain separations from service within one year after a Change in Control (as defined in the KERP). Each Participant's account balance will be deemed to be invested in mutual funds selected by the Participant from among those approved under the KERP.
The Committee has designated the following executives as Participants under the KERP: Messrs. Neil A. Schrimsher, Thomas E. Armold, Todd A. Barlett, Fred D. Bauer, Michael L. Coticchia, Mark O. Eisele, Benjamin J. Mondics, and Jeffrey A. Ramras. The Committee has provided that the company contribution percentage for Mr. Schrimsher, Applied's Chief Executive Officer, will be 10% and that he will vest in 50% of his account after three years of service, 75% after four years of service and 100% after five years of service.
The summaries of the terms of the First Amendment and the KERP are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full terms and provisions of such plans set forth in Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2 attached to this Form 8-K.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

If necessary, the Company may reduce, in accordance with Code Section 409A, the vested portion of the Participant's Company Contribution Account in order to comply with this Section 3.4.
Company Contribution Amounts
(b) . The Participant's Employer shall withhold from any payments made to a Participant under the Plan all federal, state and local income, employment and other taxes required to be withheld by the Employer in connection with such payments, in amounts and in a manner to be determined in the sole discretion of the Employer.
Distributions
 
. Upon the written request of a Participant and the showing of an Unforeseeable Emergency prior to the occurrence of a distribution event described in Articles V through VIII, as applicable, the Committee may, upon determining that such an emergency exists, cause an amount of such Participant's Account Balance to be paid to him. Such amount shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the Participant's vested Account Balance, calculated as of the close of business on the Benefit Distribution Date for such distribution, as determined by the Committee in accordance with provisions set forth below, or (ii) the amount necessary to satisfy the Unforeseeable Emergency (plus amounts necessary to pay federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution) after taking into account the extent to which the Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved (A) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, (B) by liquidation of the Participant's assets, to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship, or (C) by cessation of deferrals under any Employer-sponsored deferred compensation plan.

Committee Determination
. If the Committee, in its sole discretion, approves a Participant's request for a distribution under the Plan due to Unforeseeable Emergency, the Participant's Benefit Distribution Date shall be the date on which such approval occurs and such distribution shall be made to the Participant in a lump sum no later than 60 days after such Benefit Distribution Date; provided, however, that if the 60-day period begins in one taxable year and ends in another, the Participant shall not have a right to designate the taxable year of payment. In addition, in the event of such approval, the Participant's outstanding deferral elections under the Plan shall be cancelled.
4.2

The Participant may elect to receive such Company Contribution Account in the form of a lump sum or an Annual Installment Method of two or three years. If a Participant does not make any election with respect to the payment of his or her Company Contribution Account, then the Participant shall be deemed to have elected to receive such Company Contribution Account as a lump sum.

. The Termination Benefit of a Participant shall be paid to the Participant no later than 60 days after the Participant's Benefit Distribution Date; provided, however, that if the 60-day period begins in one taxable year and ends in another, the Participant shall not have a right to designate the taxable year of payment.

The Disability Benefit of a Participant shall be valued as of the close of business on the Participant's Benefit Distribution Date for such benefit (or, in the event such Benefit Distribution Date is not a business day, the Disability Benefit shall be valued as of the close of business of the next business day immediately following such Benefit Distribution Date), which shall be the date on which the Participant becomes Disabled.
7.1
Disability Benefit
.
7.2
Payment of a Disability Benefit
(a) Any Participant, in connection with his or her commencement of participation in the Plan, shall have elected on an Election Form to receive the Disability Benefit in a lump sum or pursuant to an Annual Installment Method of three years. If a Participant did not make any election with respect to the payment of this Disability Benefit, then such Participant shall be deemed to have elected to receive the Disability Benefit as a lump sum.
(b) A Participant may change the form of payment for the Disability Benefit by submitting an Election Form to the Company in accordance with the following criteria:
(i) The election shall not take effect until at least 12 months after the date on which the election is made; and
(ii) The election must be made at least 12 months prior to the Benefit Distribution Date that would otherwise have been applicable to the Disability Benefit.
For purposes of applying the requirements of this Section 7.2(b), a Participant's election to change the form of payment for the Disability Benefit shall not be considered to be made until the date on which the election becomes irrevocable. Such an election shall become irrevocable no later than the date that is 12 months prior to the Benefit Distribution Date that would otherwise have been applicable to the Participant's Disability Benefit. Subject to the requirements of this Section 7.2(b), the Election Form most recently accepted by the Company that has become effective shall govern the form of payout of the Participant's Disability Benefit.
 
(c) The lump sum payment shall be made, or installment payments shall commence, no later than 60 days after the Participant's Benefit Distribution Date and remaining installments, if any, shall be paid no later than 60 days after the first day of each Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the Participant's Benefit Distribution Date occurs; provided, however, that if the 60-day period begins in one taxable year and ends in another, the Participant shall not have a right to designate the taxable year of payment.
 
. In the event of a Participant's death prior to the complete distribution of his or her vested Account Balance, the Participant's Beneficiary shall receive the Participant's unpaid vested Account Balance in a lump sum payment (the "Death Benefit"). The Death Benefit shall be valued as of the close of business on the Benefit Distribution Date for such benefit (or, in the event such Benefit Distribution Date is not a business day, the Retirement Benefit shall be valued as of the close of business of the next business day immediately following such Benefit Distribution Date), which shall be the date of the Participant's death.
8.1
Death Benefit
. Any Death Benefit shall be paid to the Participant's Beneficiary no later than 60 days after the applicable Benefit Distribution Date; provided, however, that if the 60-day period begins in one taxable year and ends in another, the Participant's Beneficiary shall not have a right to designate the taxable year of payment.
8.2
Payment of a Death Benefit
 
. Each Participant shall have the right, at any time, to designate his or her Beneficiary (both primary as well as contingent) to receive any benefits payable under the Plan to a beneficiary upon the death of a Participant. The Beneficiary designated under the Plan may be the same as or different from the Beneficiary designation under any other plan of the Company in which the Participant participates.
9.1
Beneficiary
. A Participant shall designate his or her Beneficiary by completing and signing the Beneficiary Designation Form, and returning it to the Company. A Participant shall have the right to change a Beneficiary by completing, signing and otherwise complying with the terms of the Beneficiary Designation Form and the Company's rules and procedures, as in effect from time to time. The Company shall be entitled to rely on the last Beneficiary Designation Form filed by the Participant and accepted by the Company prior to his or her death.
9.2
Beneficiary Designation
. No designation or change in designation of a Beneficiary shall be effective until received and acknowledged in writing by the Company or its designated agent.
9.3
Acknowledgment
. If a Participant fails to designate a Beneficiary as provided in Sections 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 above, or if all designated Beneficiaries predecease the Participant or die prior to complete distribution of the Participant's benefits, then the Participant's designated Beneficiary shall be deemed to be his or her surviving spouse. If the Participant has no surviving spouse, the benefits remaining under the Plan to be paid to a Beneficiary shall be payable to the executor or personal representative of the Participant's estate.
9.4
No Beneficiary Designation
 
. If the Company has any doubt as to the proper Beneficiary to receive payments pursuant to the Plan, the Company shall have the right, exercisable in its discretion, to withhold such payments until this matter is resolved to the Company's satisfaction.
9.5
Doubt as to Beneficiary
. The payment of benefits under the Plan to a Beneficiary shall fully and completely discharge the Company from all further obligations under the Plan with respect to the Participant.
9.6
Discharge of Obligations
 
. If a Participant is authorized by the Participant's Employer to take a paid leave of absence from the employment of the Employer, and such leave of absence does not constitute a Separation from Service, the Participant shall continue to be considered eligible for the benefits provided under the Plan.
10.1
Paid Leave of Absence
. If a Participant is authorized by the Participant's Employer to take an unpaid leave of absence from the employment of the Employer for any reason, and such leave of absence does not constitute a Separation from Service, such Participant shall continue to be eligible for the benefits provided under the Plan.
10.2
Unpaid Leave of Absence
 
. Although Company anticipates that it will continue the Plan for an indefinite period of time, there is no guarantee that the Company will continue the Plan or will not terminate the Plan at any time in the future. In the event of a Plan termination no new deferral elections shall be permitted for the affected Participants and such Participants shall no longer be eligible to receive new Company Contribution Amounts. The Measurement Funds available to Participants following the termination of the Plan shall be comparable in number and type to those Measurement Funds available to Participants in the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the Plan termination is effective. In addition, following a Plan termination, Account Balances of Participants shall remain in the Plan and shall not be distributed until such amounts become eligible for distribution in accordance with the other applicable provisions of the Plan. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent permitted by Code Section 409A, the Company may provide that upon termination of the Plan, all Account Balances of the Participants shall be distributed, subject to and in accordance with any rules established by the Company deemed necessary to comply with the applicable requirements and limitations of Code Section 409A.
11.1
Termination of Plan
. The Company may, at any time, amend or modify the Plan in whole or in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no amendment or modification shall be effective to decrease the value of a Participant's vested Account Balance in existence at the time the amendment or modification is made, and (ii) no amendment or modification of this Section 11.2 or Section 12.2 of the Plan shall be effective.
11.2
Amendment
 
. The full payment of the Participant's vested Account Balance in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Plan shall completely discharge all obligations to a Participant and his or her designated Beneficiaries under the Plan.
11.3
Effect of Payment
 
. In general, unless specifically provided otherwise in the Plan or by the Committee, the Company shall have the discretion and authority to: (a) make, amend, interpret, and enforce all appropriate rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan; and (b) decide or resolve any and all questions, including benefit entitlement determinations and interpretations of the Plan, as may arise in connection with the Plan.
12.1
Duties of the Company
. In the administration of the Plan, the Company may, from time to time, employ agents and delegate to them such administrative duties as it sees fit (including acting through a duly appointed representative) and may from time to time consult with counsel.
12.2
Agents
. The decision or action of the Company with respect to any question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.
12.3
Binding Effect of Decisions
 
. The benefits provided for or with respect to a Participant under the Plan are in addition to any other benefits available to such Participant under any other plan, program or agreement of or with the Company or the Participant's Employer. The Plan shall supplement and shall not supersede, modify or amend any other such plan or program except as may otherwise be expressly provided.
13.1
Coordination with Other Benefits
. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, any amounts, including deferrals and Employer contributions, to be credited under the Plan with respect to a Participant shall only be credited under the Plan if such crediting will not cause the Plan to fail to comply with Code Section 409A.
13.2
Compliance with Code Section 409A
 
. The Company shall establish and maintain reasonable procedures governing the filing of benefit claims, notification of benefit determinations, and appeal of benefit determinations under the Plan (collectively, the "Claims Procedures") that comply with the requirements of ERISA Section 503 and regulations issued thereunder. Participants shall be notified of the existence of the Claims Procedures in conjunction with enrollment in the Plan and how to obtain a copy of the Claim Procedures upon request. Compliance with the Claims Procedures is a mandatory prerequisite to any claimant's right to commence action under Section 14.2.
14.1
Maintenance of Claims Procedures
. In the event that a claim or dispute is not resolved to the satisfaction of the claimant through the Claims Procedure, such claimant may, within 60 days of the final decision on review under the Claims Procedure, give written notice to the Company to have such claim dispute settled by application for arbitration in Cleveland, Ohio, in accordance with the rules then prevailing of The American Arbitration Association pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. Such arbitration shall apply to all disputes and claims arising from or relating to the Plan and ERISA, and the arbitrator's review shall be limited to a review of the information submitted to the Plan administrator. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of U.S. competent jurisdiction. The cost of any arbitration proceeding shall be shared equally by the claimant and the Company, unless the arbitrator finds it more equitable for the Company to bear the costs.
14.2
Disputes and Resolutions
 
. In order to provide assets from which to fulfill its obligations to the Participants and their Beneficiaries under the Plan, the Company may establish a Trust pursuant to a trust agreement with a third party, the trustee, to which each Employer may, in its discretion, contribute cash or other property, including securities issued by the Company, to provide for the benefit payments under the Plan.
15.1
Establishment of the Trust
. The provisions of the Plan and the Plan Agreement shall govern the rights of a Participant to receive distributions pursuant to the Plan. The provisions of the Trust shall govern the rights of the Company, Employers, Participants and the creditors of the Employers to the assets transferred to the Trust.
15.2
Interrelationship of the Plan and the Trust
. The Employer's obligations under the Plan may be satisfied with Trust assets distributed pursuant to the terms of the Trust, and any such distribution shall reduce the Employer's obligations under the Plan.
15.3
Distributions From the Trust
 
. The Plan is intended to be a plan that is not qualified within the meaning of Code Section 401(a) and that "is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees" within the meaning of ERISA Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1). The Plan is intended to comply with Code Section 409A. The Plan shall be administered and interpreted to the extent possible in a manner consistent with such intent.
16.1
Status of Plan
. Participants and their Beneficiaries, heirs, successors and assigns shall have no legal or equitable rights, interests or claims in any property or assets of an Employer. For purposes of the payment of benefits under the Plan, any and all assets of an Employer shall be, and remain, the general, unpledged unrestricted assets of the Employer. The obligation of an Employer under the Plan shall be merely that of an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money in the future.
16.2
Unsecured General Creditor
. The liability of an Employer for the payment of benefits shall be defined only by the Plan. An Employer shall have no obligation to a Participant under the Plan except as expressly provided in the Plan.
16.3
Employer's Liability
. Neither a Participant nor any other person shall have any right to commute, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, anticipate, mortgage or otherwise encumber, transfer, hypothecate, alienate or convey in advance of actual receipt, the amounts, if any, payable hereunder, or any part thereof, which are, and all rights to which are expressly declared to be, unassignable and non-transferable. No part of the amounts payable shall, prior to actual payment, be subject to seizure, attachment, garnishment or sequestration for the payment of any
16.4
Nonassignability
 
debts, judgments, alimony or separate maintenance owed by a Participant or any other person, be transferable by operation of law in the event of a Participant's or any other person's bankruptcy or insolvency or be transferable to a spouse as a result of a property settlement or otherwise.
. The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to constitute a contract of employment between any Employer and the Participant. Such employment is hereby acknowledged to be an "at will" employment relationship that can be terminated at any time for any reason, or no reason, with or without cause, and with or without notice, unless expressly provided in a written employment agreement. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the right to be retained in the service of any Employer, or to interfere with the right of any Employer to discipline or discharge the Participant at any time.
16.5
Not a Contract of Employment
. A Participant or his or her Beneficiary will cooperate with the Company by furnishing any and all information requested by the Company and take such other actions as may be requested in order to facilitate the administration of the Plan and the payments of benefits hereunder, including but not limited to taking such physical examinations as the Company may deem necessary.
16.6
Furnishing Information
. Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to the Company under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the address below:
16.7
Notice
Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.
        Attn: General Counsel
One Applied Plaza
East 36th Street & Euclid
Cleveland, OH 44115-5056
Such notice shall be deemed given as of the date of delivery or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. Any notice or
 
filing required or permitted to be given to a Participant under the Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand-delivered, or sent by mail, to the last known address of the Participant.
. If the Company determines in its discretion that a benefit under the Plan is to be paid to a minor, a person declared incompetent or to a person incapable of handling the disposition of that person's property, the Company may direct payment of such benefit to the guardian, legal representative or person having the care and custody of such minor, incompetent or incapable person. The Company may require proof of minority, incompetence, incapacity or guardianship, as it may deem appropriate prior to distribution of the benefit. Any payment of a benefit shall be a payment for the account of the Participant and the Participant's Beneficiary, as the case may be, and shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the Plan for such payment amount.
16.8
Incompetency
. The Company is authorized to make any payments directed by court order in any action in which the Plan or the Company has been named as a party. In addition, if a court determines that a spouse or former spouse of a Participant has an interest in the Participant's benefits under the Plan in connection with a domestic relations order (as defined in Code Section 414(p)(1)(B)), the Company shall have the right, notwithstanding any election made by the Participant to immediately distribute the spouse's or former spouse's interest in the Participant's benefits under the Plan to such spouse or former spouse, to the extent necessary to fulfill such domestic relations order.
16.9
Domestic Relations Orders
. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, although the Board and the Company shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the imposition of taxation, penalties, and interest under Code Section 409A and other Code provisions, the tax treatment of Company Contribution Amounts as well as credits and earnings under the Plan shall not be, and are not, warranted or guaranteed. Neither the Board, the
16.10
Tax Treatment
 
Company, any Employer nor any of their designees shall be held liable for any taxes, penalties, or other amounts owed by a Participant or Beneficiary as a result of any deferral or payment under the Plan or the administration of the Plan.
. In case any provision of the Plan shall be illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts hereof, but the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provision had never been inserted herein.
16.11
Validity
. If the Company reasonably anticipates that if a payment under the Plan were made as scheduled, the deduction with respect to such payment would not be permitted solely due to the application of Code Section 162(m), the Company may defer that payment to the extent deemed necessary to ensure deductibility; provided, however, that (i) such deduction limitation shall be applied to all similarly situated Participants on a reasonably consistent basis; (ii) the payment must be made by the earliest of (x) during the Company's first taxable year in which the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably anticipate, that if the payment is made during such year, the deduction of such payment will not be barred by application of Code Section 162(m) or (y) during the period beginning with the date of the Participant's Separation from Service and ending on the later of the last day of the taxable year of the Company in which the Participant incurs a Separation from Service of the 15th day of the third month following the Participant's Separation from Service; (iii) where any scheduled payment to a particular Participant in the Company's taxable year is delayed because of Code Section 162(m), the delay in payment will be treated as a subsequent deferral election unless all scheduled payments to such Participant that could be delayed are also delayed; (iv) where a payment is delayed to a date on or after the Participant's Separation from Service, the payment will be considered a payment upon a Separation from Service for purposes
16.12
Deduction Limitation on Benefit Payments
 
of the 6-month delay for Specified Employees; and (v) no election may be provided to a Participant with respect to the timing of payment hereunder. Any amounts deferred pursuant to the provisions of this Section 16.12 shall continue to be credited/debited with additional amounts, even if such amount is being paid out of installments.
. The provisions of the Plan shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Participant's Employer and its successors and assigns and the Participant and the Participant's designated Beneficiaries.
16.13
Successors
. The captions of the articles, sections and paragraphs of the Plan are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of its provisions.

On January 25, 2012, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. ("Applied") issued an earnings release related to its second quarter ended December 31, 2011. The earnings release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this Report on Form 8-K.
The information in this Report on Form 8-K, including the Exhibit, is being furnished and shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act.
 
 
Exhibit 99.1  Earnings release of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. dated January 25, 2012.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
 
Date: January 25, 2012
 

Exhibit 99.1
 Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported second quarter fiscal 2012 sales and earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2011.
CLEVELAND, OHIO (January 25, 2012)
Net sales for the second quarter increased 7.7% to $570,397,000 from $529,517,000 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $20,935,000 or $0.49 per share compared to $21,193,000 or $0.49 per share last year. Earnings for the quarter were reduced by $4.4 million (pre-tax), or $0.07 per share, due to one-time costs resulting from two items: CEO transition expense and freezing the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Plan ("SERP").
"The curtailment of the SERP is one of our actions to better align executive compensation with broader shareholder interests. The changes will reduce costs associated with executive retirement compensation in the current fiscal year and going forward," said Neil A. Schrimsher, Applied's Chief Executive Officer.
For the six months ended December 31, 2011, sales were $1,149,971,000 compared to $1,057,018,000 in the same period last year. Net income was $47,317,000 or $1.11 per share compared to $41,948,000 or $0.97 per share, last year.
"We are encouraged about our business prospects for the remainder of the fiscal year, and based on our second quarter results and the current state of the industrial economy, we are maintaining our full fiscal 2012 guidance for earnings per share between $2.40 and $2.55, on expected sales of $2.35 billion to $2.45 billion," said Schrimsher.
"In addition to the day-to-day operation of our business, we are updating our long-range strategic plan to accelerate growth. We are in the process of identifying numerous organic growth opportunities with existing and new customers, targeting attractive vertical markets, expanding our product and solutions offering, and building the acquisition pipeline. Operationally, the plan will include generation of continuous improvement across our operating landscape today and benefits from leveraging our new ERP system over the strategic horizon.
"Applied has a strong business foundation. As a leadership team, we are confident in our ability to expand beyond our current offerings and existing geographies  generating strong shareholder value and benefits for all Applied stakeholders."

(1) Applied uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
There were no material LIFO layer liquidation benefits recognized for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, nor are any expected to be realized for the year ending June 30, 2012. We recorded overall LIFO benefits in the quarter and six months ended December 31, 2010 of $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively and LIFO reserves were reduced by the same amount.
(2) On December 19, 2011, the Executive Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors froze participant benefits (credited service and final average earnings) and entry into the Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Plan (SERP) effective December 31, 2011. As a result, we incurred a curtailment loss of approximately $3.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Curtailment of the plan is expected to reduce pension costs in future periods.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On May 15, 2012, Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (the registrant) entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with certain financial institutions party thereto and KeyBank National Association, as Lead Arranger, Sole Book Runner and Administrative Agent for itself and the other financial institutions, providing for a five-year $150,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Agreement, which is scheduled to mature on May 14, 2017, replaces the Registrant's prior $150,000,000 credit facility with KeyBank National Association and various financial institutions. The aggregate maximum principal amount of commitments under the Credit Agreement may be expanded upon the Registrant's request, subject to certain conditions, to $200,000,000. The Credit Agreement also contains sublimits for swingline loans and letters of credit. All of the obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Registrant's U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. As of May 15, 2012, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement or the previous credit facility.
The Credit Facility is available for working capital needs and general corporate purposes of the Registrant including acquisitions.
The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on the Registrant's ability, and in certain instances, the Registrant's subsidiaries' ability to incur liens, make acquisitions and investments, or sell or transfer assets and stock. Additionally, the Registrant may not permit its leverage ratio to exceed 3.0 to 1.0 or its interest coverage ratio to exceed 3.0 to 1.0.
Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Registrant's election, at one of the following rates: (1) the base rate plus a margin that ranges from 0.00 to 32.50 basis points based on the Registrant's leverage ratio; (2) the Eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranges from 66.00 to 132.50 basis points based on the Registrant's leverage ratio; or (3) with respect to swingline loans, the Administrative Agent's cost of funds plus a margin that ranges from 66.00 to 132.50 basis points based on the Registrant's leverage ratio.
Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the Registrant's obligations under the Credit Agreement may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to lenders under the Credit Agreement, covenant defaults, certain ERISA defaults, change of control and other customary defaults.
The lenders under the Credit Agreement and their affiliates have engaged and may engage in commercial and investment banking transactions with the Registrant in the ordinary course of business, and also provide or have provided advisory and financial services to the Registrant. The Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 4 to this Form.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, during the Commitment Period, the Swing Line Lender shall make a Swing Loan or Swing Loans to the Borrower in such amount or amounts as the Borrower, through an Authorized Officer, may from time to time request and to which the Swing Line Lender may agree; provided that the Borrower shall not request any Swing Loan if, after giving effect thereto, (A) the Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment, or (B) the Swing Line Exposure would exceed the Swing Line Commitment. Each Swing Loan shall be due and payable on the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto. The Borrower shall not request that more than two Swing Loans be outstanding at any time.
(ii)
    
Refunding of Swing Loans
. If the Swing Line Lender so elects, by giving notice to the Borrower and the Lenders, the Borrower agrees that the Swing Line Lender shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to require that the then outstanding Swing Loans be refinanced as a Revolving Loan. Such Revolving Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan unless otherwise requested by and available to the Borrower hereunder. Upon receipt of such notice by the Borrower and the Lenders, the Borrower shall be deemed, on such day, to have requested a Revolving Loan in the principal amount of such Swing Loan in accordance with Sections 2.2(a) and 2.5 hereof (other than the requirement set forth in Section 2.5(d) hereof). Such Revolving Loan shall be evidenced by the Revolving Credit Notes (or, if a Lender has not requested a Revolving Credit Note, by the records of the Administrative Agent and such Lender). Each Lender agrees to make a Revolving Loan on the date of such notice, subject to no conditions precedent whatsoever. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that such Lender's obligation to make a Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.2(a) hereof when required by this Section 2.2(c)(ii) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or Event of Default, and that its payment to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swing Line Lender, of the proceeds of such Revolving Loan shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not the Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. The Borrower irrevocably authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to apply the proceeds of any borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(ii) to repay in full such Swing Loan. Each Lender is hereby authorized to record on its records relating to its Revolving Credit Note (or, if such Lender has not requested a Revolving Credit Note, its records relating to Revolving Loans) such Lender's pro rata share of the amounts paid to
28
refund such Swing Loan.
(iii)
    
Participation in Swing Loans
. If, for any reason, the Swing Line Lender is unable to or, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, it is impracticable to, convert any Swing Loan to a Revolving Loan pursuant to the preceding Section 2.2(c)(ii), then on any day that a Swing Loan is outstanding (whether before or after the maturity thereof), the Administrative Agent shall have the right to request that each Lender fund a participation in such Swing Loan, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender thereof (by facsimile or email (confirmed by telephone) or telephone (confirmed in writing). Upon such notice, but without further action, the Swing Line Lender hereby agrees to grant to each Lender, and each Lender hereby agrees to acquire from the Swing Line Lender, an undivided participation interest in the right to share in the payment of such Swing Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the principal amount of such Swing Loan. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Swing Line Lender, such Lender's ratable share of such Swing Loan (determined in accordance with such Lender's Commitment Percentage). Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in Swing Loans pursuant to this Section 2.2(c)(iii) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including, without limitation, the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, recoupment, counterclaim, withholding or reduction whatsoever and whether or not the Revolving Credit Commitment shall have been reduced or terminated. Each Lender shall comply with its obligation under this Section 2.2(c)(iii) by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.5 hereof with respect to Revolving Loans to be made by such Lender.
(iv)
    
Requests for Swing Loan When One or More Lenders are Affected Lenders
. If a Swing Loan is requested at such time that a Lender is an Affected Lender hereunder, then (A) such Swing Loan shall be issued to the extent that the Administrative Agent shall have entered into satisfactory (to the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line Lender) arrangements with the Borrower (if such Affected Lender is not a Downgraded Lender) or such Affected Lender to eliminate or mitigate the reimbursement risk with respect to such Affected Lender (including, without limitation, the posting of cash collateral), or (B) the Administrative Agent shall issue a Swing Loan in an amount that is the amount of the requested Swing Loan less the Commitment Percentage of such Affected Lender times the amount of the requested Swing Loan.
(v)
    
Swing Loans Outstanding When One or More Lenders are Affected Lenders
. With respect to any Swing Loans that are outstanding at the time any Lender is an Affected Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to require that such Affected Lender cash collateralize, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, such Swing Loans so as to eliminate or mitigate the reimbursement risk with respect to such Affected Lender.

Interest on such Base Rate Loan shall be payable, commencing June 30, 2012, and continuing on each Regularly Scheduled Payment Date thereafter and at the maturity thereof.
(ii)
    
Eurodollar Loans
. The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan outstanding from time to time, with the interest rate to be fixed in advance on the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto through the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto (but subject to changes in the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans), at the Derived Eurodollar Rate. Interest on such Eurodollar Loan shall be payable on each Interest Adjustment Date with respect to an Interest Period (provided that, if an Interest Period shall exceed three months, the interest must also be paid every three months, commencing three months from the beginning of such Interest Period).
(b)
    
Swing Loans
. The Borrower shall pay interest to the Administrative Agent, for the sole benefit of the Swing Line Lender (and any Lender that shall have funded a participation in such Swing Loan), on the unpaid principal amount of each Swing Loan outstanding from time to time from the date thereof until paid at the Derived Swing Loan Rate applicable to such Swing Loan. Interest on each Swing Loan shall be payable on the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto. Each Swing Loan shall bear interest for a minimum of one day.
(c)
    
Default Rate
. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, upon the election of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, (i) the principal of each Loan and the unpaid interest thereon shall bear interest, until paid, at the Default Rate, (ii) the fee for the aggregate undrawn amount of all issued and outstanding Letters of Credit shall be increased by two percent (2%) in excess of the rate otherwise applicable thereto, and (iii) in the case of any other amount not paid when due from the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document, such amount shall bear interest at the Default Rate; provided that, during an Event of Default under Section 7.1 or 7.10 hereof, the applicable Default Rate shall apply without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable law (the Maximum Rate). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) characterize any payment that is not principal as an
30
expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations.
Section 2.4.

(b)
    
Swing Loans

An Authorized Officer of the Borrower may verbally request a Loan, so long as a Notice of Loan is received by the end of the same Business Day, and, if the Administrative Agent or any Lender provides funds or initiates funding based upon such verbal request, the Borrower shall bear the risk with respect to any information regarding such funding that is later determined to have been incorrect. The Borrower shall comply with the notice provisions set forth in Section 2.2(b) hereof with respect to Letters of Credit.
(b)
    
Funding of Loans
. The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the date, amount and Interest Period (if applicable) promptly upon the receipt of a Notice of Loan (other than for a Swing Loan, or a Revolving Loan to be funded as a Swing Loan), and, in any event, by 2:00 P.M. (Eastern time) on the date such Notice of Loan is received. On the date that the Credit Event set forth in such Notice of Loan is to occur, each such Lender shall provide to the Administrative Agent, not later than 3:00 P.M. (Eastern time), the amount in federal or other immediately available funds, required of it. If the Administrative Agent shall elect to advance the proceeds of such Loan prior to receiving funds from such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall have the right, upon prior notice to the Borrower, to debit any account of the Borrower or otherwise receive such amount from the Borrower, promptly after demand, in the event that such Lender shall fail to reimburse the
31
Administrative Agent in accordance with this subsection (b).

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Borrower requests a Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.5(a) hereof (and all conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.1 hereof are met) at a time when one or more Lenders are Defaulting Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall require the non-Defaulting Lenders to honor such request by making a non pro-rata Revolving Loan to the Borrower in an amount equal to (i) the amount requested by the Borrower, minus (ii) the portions of such Revolving Loan that should have been made by such Defaulting Lenders. For purposes of such Revolving Loans, the Lenders that are making such Revolving Loan shall do so in an amount equal to their Commitment Percentages of the amount requested by the Borrower. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Loans made by a Lender (other than Swing Loans made by the Swing Line Lender), when combined with such Lender's pro rata share, if any, of the Letter of Credit Exposure and the Swing Line Exposure, be in excess of the Maximum Amount for such Lender.

33
first, to cash collateralize its unfunded risk participation in Swing Loans and the Letters of Credit pursuant to Sections 2.2(b)(vi), 2.2(c)(iii) and 2.5(b) hereof, and, with respect to any Defaulting Lender, second, to fulfill its obligations to make Loans.

(a)
    
Optional Reduction of Revolving Credit Commitment
. The Borrower may at any time and from time to time permanently reduce in whole or ratably in part the Revolving Credit Commitment to an amount not less than the then existing Revolving Credit Exposure, by giving the Administrative Agent not fewer than three Business Days' notice of such reduction, provided that any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount, for all of the Lenders, of not less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), increased in increments of One Million Dollars ($1.000,000). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the date of each such reduction and such Lender's proportionate share thereof. After each such partial reduction, the facility fees payable hereunder shall be calculated upon the Revolving Amount as so reduced. If the Borrower reduces in whole the Revolving Credit Commitment, on the effective date of such reduction (the Borrower having prepaid in full the unpaid principal balance, if any, of the Loans, together with all interest (if any) and facility and other fees accrued and unpaid with respect thereto, and provided that no Letter of Credit Exposure or Swing Line Exposure shall exist), all of the Revolving Credit Notes shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent marked Canceled and the Administrative Agent shall redeliver such Revolving Credit Notes to the Borrower. Any partial reduction in the Revolving Amount shall be effective during the remainder of the Commitment Period. Upon each decrease of the Revolving Amount, the Maximum Revolving Amount and the Total Commitment Amount shall be proportionally decreased.
(b)
    
Increase in Commitment
.
(i)
    
At any time during the Commitment Increase Period, the Borrower may by written notice to the Administrative Agent request an increase in the Revolving Amount from the Closing Revolving Amount up to an amount that shall not exceed the Maximum Revolving Amount. Each such request for an increase shall be in an amount of at least Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), increased by increments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), and may be made by either (A) increasing, for one or more Lenders, with their
35
prior written consent, their respective Revolving Credit Commitments, or (B) including one or more Additional Lenders, each with a new commitment under the Revolving Credit Commitment, as a party to this Agreement (each an Additional Commitment and, collectively, the Additional Commitments).
(ii)
    
During the Commitment Increase Period, all of the Lenders agree that the Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion, may permit one or more Additional Commitments upon satisfaction of the following requirements: (A) each Additional Lender, if any, shall execute an Additional Lender Assumption Agreement, (B) the Administrative Agent shall provide to the Borrower and each Lender a revised
Schedule 1
to this Agreement, including revised Commitment Percentages for each of the Lenders, if appropriate, at least three Business Days prior to the date of the effectiveness of such Additional Commitments (each an Additional Lender Assumption Effective Date), (C) each Additional Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment shall be for an amount of no less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), and (D) the Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders such replacement or additional Revolving Credit Notes as shall be required by the Administrative Agent (and requested by the Lenders). The Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to execute each Additional Lender Assumption Agreement on behalf of the Lenders.
(iii)
    
On each Additional Lender Assumption Effective Date, the Lenders shall make adjustments among themselves with respect to the Revolving Loans then outstanding and amounts of principal, interest, facility fees and other amounts paid or payable with respect thereto as shall be necessary, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, in order to reallocate among such Lenders such outstanding amounts, based on the revised Commitment Percentages and to otherwise carry out fully the intent and terms of this Section 2.9(b) (and the Borrower shall pay to the Lenders any amounts that would be payable pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof if such adjustments among the Lenders would cause a prepayment of one or more Eurodollar Loans). In connection therewith, it is understood and agreed that the Maximum Amount of any Lender will not be increased (or decreased except pursuant to subsection (a) hereof) without the prior written consent of such Lender. The Borrower shall not request any increase in the Revolving Amount pursuant to this subsection 2.9(b) if a Default or an Event of Default shall then exist, or, after giving pro forma effect to any such increase, would exist. Upon each increase of the Revolving Amount, the Total Commitment Amount shall be increased by a like amount.
36
Section 2.10.
Computation of Interest and Fees
. With the exception of Base Rate Loans, interest on Loans, Letter of Credit fees and facility and other fees and charges hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year having three hundred sixty (360) days and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed. With respect to Base Rate Loans, interest shall be computed on the basis of a year having three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and calculated for the actual number of days elapsed.

Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan or Swing Loan pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be subject to the prepayment provisions set forth in Article III hereof.
Section 2.12.
Addition of a Borrower

A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.1 together with a reasonably detailed calculation and description of such amounts contemplated by this Section 3.1, submitted by any Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence as to such additional amounts.

Section 3.2.
Taxes
.
(a)
    
All payments made by any Credit Party under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes or Other Taxes. If any Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after deducting, withholding and payment of all Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in the Loan Documents.
(b)
    
Whenever any Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be withheld and paid by a Credit Party, such Credit Party shall timely withhold and pay such taxes to the relevant Governmental Authorities. As promptly as possible thereafter, such Credit Party shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt received by such Credit Party showing payment thereof or other evidence of payment reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent or such Lender. If such Credit Party shall fail to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate Governmental Authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, such Credit Party and the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and the appropriate Lenders within five Business Days after request for payment is made for
39
any incremental Taxes or Other Taxes paid or payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender as a result of any such failure.
(c)
    
If any Lender shall be so indemnified by a Credit Party, such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to obtain the benefits of any refund, deduction or credit for any taxes or other amounts with respect to the amount paid by such Credit Party and shall reimburse such Credit Party to the extent, but only to the extent, that such Lender shall receive a refund with respect to the amount paid by such Credit Party or an effective net reduction in taxes or other governmental charges (including any taxes imposed on or measured by the total net income of such Lender) of the United States or any state or subdivision or any other Governmental Authority thereof by virtue of any such deduction or credit, after first giving effect to all other deductions and credits otherwise available to such Lender. If, at the time any audit of such Lender's income tax return is completed, such Lender determines, based on such audit, that it shall not have been entitled to the full amount of any refund reimbursed to such Credit Party as aforesaid or that its net income taxes shall not have been reduced by a credit or deduction for the full amount reimbursed to such Credit Party as aforesaid, such Credit Party, upon request of such Lender, shall promptly pay to such Lender the amount so refunded to which such Lender shall not have been so entitled, or the amount by which the net income taxes of such Lender shall not have been so reduced, as the case may be.
(d)
    
Each Lender that is not (i) a citizen or resident of the United States of America, (ii) a corporation, partnership or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America (or any jurisdiction thereof), or (iii) an estate or trust that is subject to federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income (any such Person, a Non-U.S. Lender) shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W8BEN, Form W-8IMY or Form W-8ECI, or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of portfolio interest, a statement with respect to such interest and two copies of a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by Credit Parties under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to this Agreement or such other Loan Document. In addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms or appropriate replacements promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it determines that such Lender is no longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant to this subsection (d) that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(e)
    
Any Lender that is not a Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax.
40
(f)
    
A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under any Loan Document shall use reasonable efforts to deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; provided that (i) such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such Lender's judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender, and (ii) to the extent that such Lender fails to comply with the requirements of this subpart (f), such Lender shall not be entitled to additional compensation otherwise payable under this Section 3.2 if such additional compensation would not have been required had such Lender so complied.
(g)
    
If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.
(h)
    
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(i)
    
The agreements in this Section 3.2 shall survive the termination of the Loan Documents and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
41
Section 3.3.
Funding Losses
. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender, promptly after receipt of a written request therefor, and to hold each Lender harmless from, any properly documented loss or expense that such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice (including a written or verbal notice that is subsequently revoked) requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion from Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice (including a written or verbal notice that is subsequently revoked) thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, (c) the making of a prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, (d) the making of a prepayment of a Swing Loan on a day that is not the Swing Loan Maturity Date applicable thereto, or (e) any conversion of a Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto. Such indemnification shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amounts so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such failure) or the applicable Swing Loan Maturity Date in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the appropriate London interbank market, along with any administration fee charged by such Lender. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 submitted to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) by any Lender, together with a reasonably detailed calculation and description of such amounts shall be rebuttably presumptive evidence as to such amounts. The obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Section 3.4.
Eurodollar Rate Lending Unlawful; Inability to Determine Rate
.
(a)
    
If any Lender shall determine (which determination shall, upon notice thereof to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, be conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that, after the Closing Date, (i) the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or (ii) any Governmental Authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender to make or continue any Loan as, or to convert (if permitted pursuant to this Agreement) any Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan, the obligations of such Lender to make, continue or convert into any such Eurodollar Loan shall, upon such determination, be suspended until such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and all outstanding Eurodollar Loans payable to such Lender shall automatically convert (if conversion is permitted under this Agreement) into a Base Rate Loan, or be repaid (if no conversion is permitted) at the end of the then current Interest Periods with respect thereto or sooner, if required by law or such assertion.
42
(b)
    
If the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain such Eurodollar Loan shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of such Eurodollar Loan or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of a Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein.
Section 3.5.
Change of Lending Office
. Each Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 3.1 or 3.2(a) hereof with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office (or an affiliate of such Lender, if practical for such Lender) for any Loans affected by such event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided, that such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; and provided, further, that nothing in this Section 3.5 shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2(a) hereof.
Section 3.6.
Replacement of Lenders
. The Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2(a) hereof, or asserts its inability to make a Eurodollar Loan pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof; provided that (a) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (b) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement, (c) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 3.5 hereof so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2(a) hereof or, if it has taken any action, such request has still been made, (d) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement and assume all commitments and obligations of such replaced Lender (and any such purchase shall be considered a prepayment of such Loans for purposes of Section 3.3 hereof), (e) the Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 3.3 hereof if any Eurodollar Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto, (f) the replacement Lender, if not already a Lender, shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (g) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.10 hereof (provided that the Borrower (or the succeeding Lender, if such Lender is willing) shall be obligated to pay the assignment fee referred to therein), and (h) until such time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 3.1 or 3.2(a) hereof, as the case may be; provided that a Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to replace such Lender cease to apply.
43
Section 3.7.
Discretion of Lenders as to Manner of Funding
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of such Lender's Loans in any manner such Lender deems to be appropriate; it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder shall be made as if such Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan during the applicable Interest Period for such Loan through the purchase of deposits having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

(d)
    
with respect to a Foreign Subsidiary that is not a CFC (or owned by a CFC), if the Administrative Agent, in its reasonable discretion, after consultation with the Borrower, determines that the cost of delivery of any such Guaranty of Payment is illegal, impractical or cost-prohibitive, then the Administrative Agent may agree to forego (until such time as the Administrative Agent determines it is no longer illegal, impractical or cost-prohibitive in light of the circumstances to do so) the delivery of such Guaranty of Payment; and
(e) 
    
notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.19 to the contrary, (i) any Company that is a Guarantor of the obligations under any Material Indebtedness Agreement of the Borrower, and (ii) subject to Section 5.19(a) and (b) hereof, any Domestic Subsidiary that is the parent of a Foreign Subsidiary, shall also be required to execute a Guaranty of Payment pursuant to this Section 5.19, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Administrative Agent.

In no event shall the Administrative Agent or any Lender be obligated or required to return any materials furnished by or on behalf of any Company.

Section 10.20.
No Duty

Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c))
On July 23, 2012, Dan P. Komnenovich and Vincent K. Petrella were elected to the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (Applied). Applied issued the press release attached as Exhibit 99.1 announcing the elections.
Mr. Komnenovich was also named to the Board's Corporate Governance Committee and Mr. Petrella to the Audit Committee.
Mr. Komnenovich, age 59, was elected for a term expiring in 2013. He has been President and Chief Executive Officer of Aviall, Inc. since January 2010. Aviall, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company (NYSE: BA), is one of the world's largest providers of new aviation parts and related aftermarket operations. It also provides maintenance for aviation batteries, wheels and brakes, as well as hose assembly, kitting, and paint-mixing services, and offers a complete set of supply chain and logistics services, including order processing, stocking and fulfillment, automated inventory management, and reverse logistics to OEMs and customers. From 2000 until January 2010, he was Aviall's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
Mr. Komnenovich leads a global multi-billion dollar distribution company which has grown significantly during his service as a senior executive. He brings to Applied's Board extensive experience with distribution sales, marketing, operations, supply chain management, and logistics. Earlier in his career, Mr. Komnenovich also served in finance and accounting roles (he was a Certified Public Accountant) with various companies.
Mr. Petrella, age 51, was elected for a term expiring at the 2012 annual meeting of shareholders, scheduled for October 23. He is Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LECO). Lincoln Electric engages in the design, manufacture, and sale of welding, cutting, and brazing products worldwide.
As one of Lincoln Electric's top executives, Mr. Petrella has helped lead the company's global expansion over the last decade. His leadership and operating experience, and his knowledge of industrial distribution in North America and abroad, position him to be a key contributor to discussions about Applied's strategy. In addition, Mr. Petrella's finance and accounting background (before joining Lincoln Electric he was a Certified Public Accountant with an international public accounting firm) and his current service as Chief Financial Officer for a multi-billion dollar public company make him a fine addition to the Board and the Audit Committee.
As a result of their election as directors, Messrs. Komnenovich and Petrella shall be entitled to receive the compensation for their services as directors and committee members paid to all other non-employee directors, which compensation is described under the heading Director Compensation on pages 14 and 15 of Applied's proxy statement relating to its Annual Shareholder Meeting held on October 25, 2011, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on September 9, 2011. Following the filing of that proxy statement, the Board modified the non-employee director compensation program to eliminate the distinction in fees between meetings via telephone conference of less than 30 minutes and longer meetings. The description of non-employee director compensation in the proxy statement under Director Compensation, as so modified, is incorporated herein by reference.
With respect to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, there are no relationships or related transactions to which either Mr. Komnenovich or Mr. Petrella is a party that would be required to be disclosed in accordance with Item 404 of Regulation S-K.

looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. Although Applied believes its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions by management, Applied cannot assure that the expectations reflected in this document will be achieved because they are subject to risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict and may be outside of Applied's control.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Applied Industrial Technologies Reports
Record Sales and Earnings for Fiscal 2012
CLEVELAND, OHIO (August 9, 2012)
- Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 year ended June 30, 2012.
Fiscal 2012 full-year sales were a record $2.4 billion, up 7.3% from fiscal 2011 sales of $2.2 billion. Net income for the year increased to a record $108.8 million, or $2.54 per share, compared with $96.8 million, or $2.24 per share, in fiscal 2011.
Net sales for the fourth quarter were $620.0 million, up 5.1% from $589.9 million for the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $32.0 million, or $0.75 per share, compared with last year's fourth quarter earnings of $28.3 million, or $0.65 per share.
Commenting on results, Applied's Chief Executive Officer Neil A. Schrimsher said, We had a record fiscal year in 2012, with strong results across the Company. We translated a 7% sales gain into strong earnings growth and cash flow, continuing our sound operating discipline and focus on operational excellence. We are pleased with the operating margin achievement of 7.1% for the year, especially when considering our ERP investment and when compared with 6.8% last year.
We were active on the acquisition front during the year, completing three strategic acquisitions in Eastern Canada. In addition, and subsequent to our fiscal year end, we finalized the purchase of SKF Distribution in Australia and New Zealand as announced last week. We are moving ahead quickly on integrating these businesses into Applied and executing our growth strategy for these markets.
As a leadership team, we have developed a long-range strategic plan to accelerate profitable growth with a focus on expanding our value-add, extending our reach, and enhancing our technology to better serve our customers. Implementation of the plan is underway -- supported by a company-wide commitment to realizing our full potential and generating increased shareholder value.
Nearer term, we remain optimistic about the industrial economic environment and our ability to execute our strategic plan in the new fiscal year. For fiscal 2013, we are forecasting earnings per share of $2.90 to $3.05. This guidance assumes full-year revenue growth of 9 to 13 percent, including the SKF Distribution acquisition.
During the quarter, the Company purchased 333,100 shares of its common stock in open market transactions for $12.0 million. For the full fiscal year, purchases totaled 997,200 shares for $31.0 million. At June 30, 2012, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 1,142,800 additional shares.
Applied will host its quarterly conference call for investors and analysts at 4 p.m. ET, today. The call will be conducted by CEO Neil A. Schrimsher, President & COO Benjamin J. Mondics, and Vice President & CFO Mark O. Eisele. To join the call, dial 1-800-927-0469 or 1-847-944-7323 (for International callers) prior to the scheduled start using passcode 32873463.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1) Applied uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
During the June 30, 2012 quarter, the Company recorded overall LIFO benefits of $0.6 million and the LIFO reserves were reduced by the same amount. These reductions resulted from LIFO layer liquidation benefits of $3.4 million from certain inventory quantity levels decreasing. If inventory levels had remained constant, additional LIFO expense in the amount of the layer liquidation benefit would have been recorded. Overall LIFO expense for all of fiscal 2012 was $7.1 million, which is net of the $3.4 million of LIFO layer liquidation benefits.
In the prior year, overall LIFO benefits in the quarter and twelve months ended June 30, 2011 were $2.8 million and $5.3 million, respectively, and LIFO reserves were reduced by the same amount. These reductions resulted from some effective supplier price decreases in the first half of our fiscal year as well as LIFO layer liquidation benefits (of $9.6 million for the quarter and $12.3 million for the year) from certain inventory quantity levels decreasing. If inventory levels had remained constant, additional LIFO expense in the amount of the layer liquidation would have been recorded.

Exhibit 10.01
Management Incentive Plan General Terms
Authority
The annual Management Incentive Plan (the Plan) is established by the Board's Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the Committee) under the 2011 Long-Term Performance Plan (the 2011 LTPP).
Objective
The Plan's objective is to reward eligible participants for their contributions toward the achievement of Applied's fiscal year business goals.
 
Participation
The Plan's participants are those key employees of Applied who are designated as Plan participants by the Committee.
Plan Goals
The Committee shall establish the Plan's goals. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of (i) a merger, a consolidation, an acquisition or divestiture, the issuance or repurchase of a substantial amount of capital stock, a reorganization or restructuring, or any other transaction or series of transactions, or (ii) asset write-downs, or litigation or claim judgments or settlements, or foreign exchange gains or losses, or (iii) changes in tax laws, accounting principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, or (iv) other extraordinary nonrecurring items, then the Committee, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Plan goals, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits intended to be conferred, in such manner as the Committee determines is equitably required by the changes or events.
Eligibility for Awards
If Plan goals are met, to be eligible for an award under the Plan, a participant must comply with the 2011 LTPP. In addition, except as provided in the 2011 LTPP, the participant must be actively employed by Applied on the last day of the fiscal year, except that,
Plan awards are intended to create an incentive for participants to act in Applied's best interests. Notwithstanding anything in these terms to the contrary,
The provisions of this section are a fundamental term of the award.
Change in Control
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the participant's employment with Applied is terminated during the fiscal year, following any Change in Control of Applied, either by the participant for Good Reason or by Applied without Cause, then the award shall be deemed to be fully earned at the target incentive value.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to limit any economic benefit to which the participant is entitled under this award or the Plan.
Other
These General Terms, together with the 2011 LTPP, govern the Plan. The Committee has the authority to construe the Plan, to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations, in the Committee's judgment, necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the 2011 LTPP and the General Terms, the provisions of the 2011 LTPP shall govern. Moreover, it should be noted that unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized words in these General Terms shall have the same meanings as set forth in the 2011 LTPP.
The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency with respect to the Plan in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under these provisions shall be conclusive for all purposes.
The provisions of these terms and conditions are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
The validity, construction, interpretation, and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
Applied has made no warranties or representations to the participant with respect to the tax consequences (including but not limited to income tax consequences) related to the Plan, and the participant has been advised to consult with the participant's attorney, accountant and/or tax advisor regarding the Plan. Moreover, the participant acknowledges that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for the participant.

Exhibit 10.02
Stock Appreciation Rights Award Terms and Conditions
Your Stock Appreciation Rights Award (the SARs or the Award) is made by Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., an Ohio corporation (Applied). For purposes of these terms and conditions, employment by a parent, subsidiary, or an affiliate of Applied shall be considered employment by Applied.
1.
    
Grant of SARs; Exercisability.
The Award is governed by Applied's 2011 Long-Term Performance Plan (the Plan), including the policies adopted by the Executive Organization & Compensation Committee of Applied's Board of Directors (the Committee) under the Plan, and these terms and conditions. Upon valid exercise, the Award entitles you to receive such number of shares of Applied common stock (Shares) that have a fair market value equal to the difference (if positive) between the fair market value of (a) a Share on the date of exercise over (b) the Base Price, multiplied by (c) the number of Shares with respect to which the Award is exercised, subject to the following conditions:
(a)
    
Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2 and 7, below, your Award will be exercisable only if and after you have remained in Applied's continuous employ from the Award's grant date (the Grant Date) to the vesting date of all or the specified portion of your Award. Your Award vests with respect to only 25% of the aggregate number of Shares to which it relates after one year of continuous employment from the Grant Date, which percentage increases to 50% after two years, to 75% after three years, and to 100% after four years of continuous employment from the Grant Date.
(b)
    
Except as otherwise provided, your Award shall expire at the end of the 10-year period commencing with the Grant Date (the Term), or upon such earlier expiration or your separation from service date as may be provided by Sections 2 and 7 below. The SARs shall not be exercisable thereafter.
2.
    
Termination of SARs.
If, during the Term, you incur a separation from service from Applied for any reason, you may exercise your SARs, to the extent you were entitled to exercise them immediately prior to your separation from service, at any time within three months after your separation from service (but only during the Term);
provided, however
, that (i) if you Retire, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within three years after your retirement (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; (ii) if you incur a separation from service due to your permanent and total disability, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your separation from service (but only during the Term), you may exercise the SARs; and (iii) if you die while employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully exercisable and, at any time within one year after your death (but only during the Term), the person entitled by will or applicable law to exercise the SARs may do so.
Awards are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests.
Notwithstanding anything in these terms to the contrary,
(a)
Your Award may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required to immediately repay all Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous twelve months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending twelve months following your separation from service, you have committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, or vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective at the time of your act.
(b)
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay Shares (and any dividends and distributions thereon) issued pursuant to the Award within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (x) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (y) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (I) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (II) your earnings pursuant to the Award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
  
The provisions of this section are a fundamental term of the Award.
3.
    
Method of Exercise; Rights of Holder.
During your life, your Award may be exercised only by you, your guardian, or legal representative. Upon your death, your Award may be exercised by the person entitled by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
Your SARs may be exercised by delivering to Applied at its principal executive offices (directed to the attention of the Chief Financial Officer or Corporate Secretary) a written notice (which may include facsimile transmission or electronic mail), signed by you or such other person entitled to exercise the SARs, of the election to exercise the SARs and stating the number of Shares as to which the SARs are being exercised. The SARs shall be deemed exercised as of the date Applied receives the notice. If the SARs are exercised, as provided herein, by any person other than you, the notice shall be accompanied by appropriate evidence of that person's right to exercise the SARs. As a condition to your valid exercise of the SARs, you hereby consent to Applied withholding from the Shares issuable upon exercise (if any), such number of Shares the fair market value of which Applied determines to be equal to the amount required to be withheld pursuant to applicable federal, state or local law, including tax withholding requirements. Promptly following the proper exercise of the SARs, Applied shall issue in the name of the person exercising the SARs, a certificate representing the Shares due hereunder. Your SARs may be exercised only with respect to a whole number of Shares, and may not be exercised in fractional amounts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and the restrictions on exercise contained in Section 2, if, in the event your employment with Applied is terminated within the three-year period immediately following any Change in Control of Applied either by you for Good Reason or by Applied without Cause, then your SARs then outstanding shall become fully exercisable as of the date immediately prior to the date of termination of your employment.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled under this Award or the Plan, including the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c) below. In the event of the occurrence of any of the transactions described in Section 7(a) through (c), the provisions in Section 7 purporting to terminate your SARs shall not apply and you shall have the option either to exercise your rights under Section 7 or to deem the SARs assumed by the successor within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, whichever is more favorable to you.
As an SAR holder, you shall have absolutely no rights as a shareholder, whether before or after vesting of all or any portion of your Award.
4.
    
Limitations on Exercise.
Your SARs shall not be exercisable if such exercise or the issuance of Shares pursuant to your Award would violate:
(a)
    
Any state securities law;
(b)
    
Any registration or other requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any stock exchange's listing requirements; or
(c)
    
Any other legal requirement of any governmental authority.
If your exercise of SARs is prevented by the terms of any of the foregoing subsections, and the Term of the SARs expires, then you may, within 30 days after Applied notifies you that your exercise is no longer prevented by this
Section 4, exercise the SARs to the extent they would have been exercisable but for the operation of this Section 4.
Furthermore, if a registration statement with respect to Shares issuable upon exercise of the SARs is not in effect or if Applied's counsel otherwise deems it necessary or desirable in order to avoid possible violations of the Act, Applied may require, as a condition to its issuance and delivery of certificates for the Shares, the delivery to Applied of a commitment in writing by the person exercising the SARs that (i) at the time of the exercise it is his intention to acquire the Shares for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution thereof; (ii) the person understands that the Shares may be restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 issued under the Act; and (iii) any resale, transfer or other disposition of the Shares will be accomplished only in compliance with Rule 144, the Act, or other or subsequent rules and regulations thereunder. Applied may place on the certificates representing the Shares a legend reflecting that commitment and Applied may refuse to permit transfer of the Shares until it has been furnished evidence satisfactory to it that no violation of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder would be involved in the transfer.
5.
    
No Guaranty of Employment.
The Award is not a guaranty of employment or commitment by Applied of continued employment. Nothing in the Award or these terms and conditions alters, limits or restricts any right Applied would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of your employment.
6.
    
Nonassignability.
The Award is not assignable or transferable, in whole or in part, and may not be otherwise disposed of by you, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or with the prior written consent of Applied.
7.
    
Liquidation, Dissolution, Merger, Sale of Substantially All Assets.
If (a) Applied is to be merged, consolidated or reorganized into or with another entity so that Applied is not the surviving corporation and, immediately after such event, the holders of Shares immediately prior to the event hold, in the aggregate, less than a majority of the combined voting power of the then outstanding securities of the new entity, (b) Applied is to be dissolved or liquidated, or (c) substantially all of Applied's assets are to be sold, then the Committee shall give you 30 days' prior written notice. Upon the giving of that notice, if you are employed by Applied, then the SARs shall become fully vested and exercisable. Within the 30-day period (but only during the Term), you shall have the right to exercise your SARs. Thereafter, notwithstanding any other provision of these terms and conditions, the SARs shall expire, unless assumed by another corporation within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
8.
    
Adjustments.
In the event (a) of a stock dividend or stock split or (b) the Shares are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of securities of Applied or another entity, then the Shares purchasable or the Base Price hereunder shall be equitably adjusted so that the SARs represent the right to acquire Shares or the number and kind of other securities that are economically equivalent to what the Shares would have represented had the SARs been fully exercised immediately preceding such event.
In the event other changes or events relating to the Shares fundamentally change the value of the Shares or securities for which the SARs are exercisable, then the Committee may make, in its sole discretion, such adjustments in the terms of the SARs as the Committee may determine is equitably required by the change or event.
9.
    
Committee Authority.
The Committee shall have authority, subject to the Plan's express provisions, to construe these terms and conditions and the Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and to make all other determinations in the Committee's judgment necessary or desirable for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or these terms and conditions in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect. All Committee action under this Section shall be conclusive for all purposes.
10.
    
Relationship to the Plan.
In the event of any inconsistency between these terms and conditions and any provision of the Plan or the Committee's policies, the Plan or the policies shall govern. Terms used but not otherwise defined in these terms and conditions shall have the meaning ascribed them in the Plan. Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, these terms and conditions and the SARs granted shall be subject to all of the Plan's provisions in effect from time to time, which are incorporated herein by reference.
11.
    
Severability
. The provisions of these terms and conditions are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
12
.
    
Applicable Law
. The validity, construction, interpretation and enforceability of these terms and conditions shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
13
.
    
Tax Matters
. Applied has made no warranties or representations to you with respect to the tax consequences (including but not limited to income tax consequences) related to the Award or the issuance, transfer or disposition of Shares pursuant to the Award, and you have been advised to consult with your attorney, accountant and/or tax advisor regarding this Award. Moreover, you acknowledge that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for you.

Exhibit 10.03
Restricted Stock Units Terms and Conditions
1.
Award of Restricted Stock Units
. The Executive Organization & Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. (Applied) on the Grant Date awarded you a certain number of restricted stock units (the RSUs). Such award represents your right to receive an equal number of shares of Applied common stock (Shares), issuable from Applied's available treasury shares, upon the expiration of the Restriction Period (as defined in Section 3 hereof). The terms and conditions of the RSUs as set forth herein (the Terms) together with the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. 2011 Long-Term Performance Plan (the Plan) govern your rights with respect to the RSUs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the Terms, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. Moreover, it should be noted that unless otherwise provided herein, capitalized words in the Terms shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Plan.
2.
Rights during Restriction Period
. You shall not have the right to sell, exchange, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, or otherwise encumber or dispose of the RSUs until all conditions with respect to vesting and distribution have been met. Nevertheless, during the Restriction Period and so long as no forfeiture has occurred, you shall be entitled to receive cash payments equal to the dividends and cash distributions paid on Shares underlying the RSUs (Dividend Equivalents) to the same extent and on the same date as if each RSU were a Share; provided, however, that no Dividend Equivalents shall be payable to you with respect to dividends or distributions the record date for which occurs on or after (i) the date on which a forfeiture of the RSUs has occurred, (ii) the date on which the Restriction Period has expired, or (iii) the date on which issuance of Shares to you has occurred. You shall not have voting rights with respect to the RSUs and, until the issuance of Shares in settlement of the RSUs, you shall not be treated as a shareholder with respect to the Shares.
3.
Restriction Period
. The term Restriction Period means the period from the Grant Date until the 3
rd
anniversary of the Grant Date.
4.
Vesting
. Except as specifically provided otherwise in Sections 5 and 6, you will be 100% vested in the RSUs as of the end of the Restriction Period; provided, however, that in the event you incur a Separation from Service during the Restriction Period after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, you will be vested at the end of the Restriction Period in a pro rata portion of the RSUs equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months (including partial months) elapsed in the Restriction Period prior to the date of such Separation from Service and the denominator of which is thirty-six.
5.
Separation from Service
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, but subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) hereunder, if, during the Restriction Period, you incur a Separation from Service (as defined in Section 409A) from Applied due to death or Disability (as defined under Section 409A) then (i) you (or your beneficiary designated to Applied in writing) shall be vested in a pro rata portion of the RSUs equal to a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months (including partial months) elapsed in the Restriction Period prior to the date of such Separation from Service and the denominator of which is thirty-six, and (ii) the remaining RSUs shall be deemed forfeited. In the event, however, that you, during the Restriction Period, incur a Separation from Service from Applied for any reason other than (i) those specifically set forth above or in Section 6, or (ii) termination after attaining age 55 and completing at least ten years of service with Applied, then the entire award of RSUs shall be forfeited and no amount shall be due or payable to you under the Terms.
Because awards of RSUs are intended to create an incentive for recipients to act in Applied's best interests, notwithstanding anything in the Terms to the contrary:
(a)
Your award of RSUs may be terminated or rescinded, and if applicable, you may be required immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends, distributions, and Dividend Equivalents thereon) issued pursuant to the award of RSUs hereunder within the previous twelve months (or any proceeds thereof), if the Committee determines, in good faith, that during your employment with Applied or during the period ending twelve months following the your Separation from Service, you committed an act inimical to Applied's interests. Acts inimical to Applied's interest shall include willful inattention to duty; willful violation of Applied's published policies; acts of fraud or dishonesty involving Applied's business; solicitation of Applied's employees, customers, or vendors to terminate or alter their relationship with Applied to Applied's detriment; unauthorized use or disclosure of information regarding Applied's business, employees, customers, or vendors; and competition with Applied. All determinations by the Committee shall be effective as of the time of your act.
(b)
The Committee may, in its sole discretion, require you immediately to repay all Shares (and any dividends, distributions, and Dividend Equivalents thereon) issued pursuant to the award of RSUs hereunder within the previous 36 months (or any proceeds thereof) if (I) Applied restates its historical consolidated financial statements and (II) the Committee determines, in good faith, that (x) the restatement is a result of your, or another executive officer's, willful misconduct that is unethical or illegal, and (y) your earnings pursuant to the award were based on materially inaccurate financial statements or materially inaccurate performance metrics that were invalidated by the restatement.
6.
Change in Control
. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 4 and 5, in the event your employment with Applied is terminated during the Restriction Period and within the three-year period immediately following any Change in Control of Applied either by you for Good Reason or by Applied without Cause, then all of the RSUs awarded hereunder to you shall be 100% vested.
In addition, following a Change in Control of Applied, no provision hereof shall operate to reduce any time frame or to limit any economic benefit to which you are entitled with respect to the RSUs or under the Plan.
7.    Adjustment of RSUs for Certain Events
. In the event of a stock split, stock dividend, combination, reclassification, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, exchange, spin-off, spin-out, or other distribution of assets to shareholders, or other similar event or change in capitalization such that shares of Applied common stock are changed into or become exchangeable for a different number of shares, thereafter the number of RSUs will be increased or decreased, as the case may be, in direct proportion to the increase or decrease in the number of shares of common stock by reason of such change in corporate structure; provided, however, that the number of RSUs shall always be a whole number. If there occurs any other change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of common stock or other Applied securities, or of any shares of stock or other securities into which such shares of common stock shall have been changed or for which they shall have been exchanged, then Applied may adjust the number or kind of RSUs or other securities into which the RSUs may be settled, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine is equitable, and such adjustment so made shall be effective and binding for all purposes.
8.    Settlement of Award and Distribution of Shares
. Your award of RSUs hereunder shall be settled in whole Shares. Fractional Shares shall not be issuable hereunder and any fractional Share shall be disregarded. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this Section 8, Shares subject to an award of RSUs hereunder shall only be issued and distributed to you in a single sum of whole Shares within the 75-day period after the end of the Restriction Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that your RSUs become vested due to death, Disability or a Change in Control, the award of RSUs hereunder shall be settled in a single sum of whole Shares within the 75-day period after such vesting. In the event that any such 75-day period begins in one calendar
year and ends in another, you (or your beneficiary as the case may be) shall not have the right to designate the calendar year of payment. Moreover, notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a Specified Employee, a distribution of Shares may not be made until within the 30-day period commencing with the first day of the seventh month following the month of any Separation from Service for reasons other than Disability or a Change in Control, or, if earlier, your death, except as maybe otherwise permitted under Section 409A.
9.    Payment of Taxes
. Upon the vesting of the RSUs, Applied shall withhold Shares from your award for any federal, state or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld by Applied attributable to the award.
10.    Section 409A Compliance
. To the extent applicable, it is intended the Terms and the award of RSUs shall comply with or be exempt from the provisions of Section 409A and any interpretations of these terms shall be consistent with such intent.
11.    Administration of the Plan
. The Committee shall have conclusive authority, subject to the express provisions of the Plan as in effect from time to time and the Terms, to construe the Terms and the Plan, and to establish, amend, and rescind rules and regulations for the Plan's administration. The Committee may correct any defect or supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Terms in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient to carry the Plan into effect, and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. Applied's Board of Directors (the Board) may from time to time grant to the Committee such further powers and authority as the Board shall determine to be necessary or desirable. Notwithstanding any other provision of these terms, any amendment, construction, establishment, rescission or correction of the type referred to above which is made or adopted following a Change in Control, and which amendment, construction, establishment or correction adversely affects your rights hereunder, shall be in writing and shall be effective only with your express and prior written consent .
12.    Relationship to the Plan
. The Terms are subject to the provisions of the Plan and any administrative policies adopted by the Committee. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms and the Plan or such policies, the Plan and the policies, in that order, shall govern. References in the Terms to Applied shall include Applied's subsidiaries.
13.    Severability
. The provisions of the Terms are severable and if any one or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
14.    No Guarantee of Employment
. The Terms and your award shall not confer upon you any rights whatsoever other than those expressly set forth herein, in the Plan or in policies adopted by the Committee. Nothing in the Terms shall (i) interfere with or limit in any way Applied's right to terminate your employment at any time, (ii) confer upon you any right to continued employment with Applied, or (iii) create any contractual or other right to receive additional awards or other Plan benefits in the future.
15.    Requirements of Law
. The granting of the RSUs hereunder shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agency, national securities exchange, or automated quotation system may be required. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Terms, Applied shall not be obligated to issue, deliver or transfer any Shares, make any distribution of benefits under the Plan or the Terms, or take any other action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action, unless such delivery, distribution, or action is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to, the requirements of the Securities Act and Section 409A).
16.    Successors
. All obligations of Applied under the Terms with respect to the RSUs shall be binding upon any successor to Applied, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all, or substantially all, of the business and/or assets of Applied. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4, in the event any such successor does not agree to be bound by the Terms, the RSUs granted hereunder shall immediately become vested.
17.    Applicable Law
. The validity, construction, interpretation and enforceability of these Terms shall be determined and governed by the laws of the State of Ohio without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law.
18.    Tax Matters
.

Moreover, you acknowledge that Applied has no responsibility to take or refrain from taking any actions in order to achieve a certain tax result for you.

EPS up 14% on 5.3% sales gain
CLEVELAND, OH (October 23, 2012)
- Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported first quarter fiscal 2013 sales and earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2012.

Commenting on results, Applied's Chief Executive Officer Neil A. Schrimsher said,
We continued to leverage our sales growth into solid earnings performance, converting a 5.3% sales increase to an 11.9% improvement in net income and a 14% increase in earnings per share. In addition, our strong operating margin of 7.3% for the quarter reflects the numerous initiatives we have in place to increase our efficiency, productivity and profitability.

In the current macroeconomic industrial environment, we are maintaining our full-year fiscal 2013 earnings per share guidance of $2.90 to $3.05, while we are adjusting our revenue growth expectations to 6% to 10%.
In addition, Mr. Schrimsher announced today that the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share, payable on November 30, 2012, to shareholders of record on November 15, 2012.

This press release contains statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases. Forward-looking statements are often identified by qualifiers such as expect, guidance,
and similar expressions. Applied intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors including trends in the industrial sector
of the economy, and other risk factors identified in Applied's most recent periodic report and other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, and the making of such statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved. Applied assumes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether due to new information, or events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1) Applied uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
There were no LIFO layer liquidation benefits recognized for the quarters ended September 30, 2012 and 2011.

(6) The term "" shall mean: (i) the willful and continued failure by a Participant to perform substantially his or her duties with the Company or one of its Affiliates (other than for Disability or Good Reason), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Participant by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or Chief Executive Officer believes that the Participant has not substantially performed his or her duties; or (ii) the willful engagement by the Participant in illegal conduct or gross misconduct involving moral turpitude that is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company; provided, however, that no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith or without his or her reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority given the Participant pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or upon the instructions of the Chief Executive Officer or a senior officer of the Company or based upon the advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be done, or omitted to be done, in good faith and in the best interests of the Company. A Participant's Separation from Service with the Company shall not be deemed to be for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Participant a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than threequarters of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Participant and the Participant being given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Participant is guilty of the conduct described in clauses (i) or (ii) above, and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

Good
Reason
3. Article VIII of the Plan is hereby amended to provide as follows:
. If, during the two-year period commencing upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, a Participant incurs a Separation from Service with the Company and its Affiliates that is initiated by the Company other than for Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason, such Participant shall receive, pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.5, a supplemental retirement benefit equal to the Accrued Portion his supplemental normal retirement benefit determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2; provided, however, that for purposes of calculating the single sum payment of such supplemental retirement benefit under Section 8.5, if such Participant has not yet attained age 55 on the date of his Separation from Service, he shall be credited with additional years of age (but not Service) equal to the difference between his age on his Separation from Service date and age 55.

8.2 Disabled
. Any Participant, who incurred a Separation from Service prior to a Change of Control and who is eligible for a supplemental deferred retirement benefit, shall receive the present value of his supplemental deferred retirement benefit determined under Section 6.2 in a single sum calculated under the provisions of Section 8.5.
8.3 Previously Terminated Participant
. Any supplemental retirement benefits being paid under the Plan at the time a Change of Control occurs to a retired or terminated Participant or to the Contingent Annuitant of a deceased Participant shall cease and such Participant or Contingent Annuitant shall receive the actuarial present value of any future payments of such benefits in a single sum pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.5.
8.4 Payments in Pay Status
.

EXHIBIT 99.1
Applied Industrial Technologies Reports Fiscal 2013
Second Quarter Results and Increases Dividend
CLEVELAND, OHIO (January 31, 2013)
- Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported second quarter fiscal 2013 sales and earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2012.
Net sales for the second quarter increased 3.4% to $589.5 million from $570.4 in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter increased to $27.0 million, or $0.64 per share, compared to $20.9 million, or $0.49 per share, last year.
For the six months ended December 31, 2012, sales increased 4.4% to $1.20 billion from $1.15 billion in the same period last year. Net income increased 19.6% to $56.6 million, or $1.33 per share, compared to $47.3 million, or $1.11 per share, last year.
Commenting on results, Applied's Chief Executive Officer Neil A. Schrimsher said, With a modest increase in sales, our cost controls and efficiency gains helped generate a solid increase in earnings and profitability for the quarter. Our gross profit margin of 27.6% reflects a 30 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter, and our 6.9% operating margin represents a 110 basis point increase over the prior year period.
While some of the recent macroeconomic headwinds will continue as we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we remain optimistic about the overall North American industrial economy for calendar 2013. We are focused on driving operating performance in the current environment and implementing programs that support our long-range strategic plan for growth and profitability - organically, via acquisition and through our technology investments.
At the midpoint of our fiscal year, and given the current economic environment, we are now projecting earnings per share to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.90 on revenue growth expectations of 4% to 7%.
In addition, Mr. Schrimsher announced today that the Company's Board of Directors declared a 10% increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.23 per common share. The dividend is payable on February 28, 2013, to shareholders of record on February 15, 2013. We are confident in our ongoing business position, and we are committed to generating increased shareholder value, including paying an attractive dividend.
The Company will host its quarterly conference call for investors and analysts at 10 a.m. ET on January 31. The call will be conducted by CEO Neil A. Schrimsher, President & COO Benjamin J. Mondics, and Vice President & CFO Mark O. Eisele. To join the call, dial 1-888-771-4371 or 1-847-585-4405 (for International callers) prior to the scheduled start using passcode 34021417.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1) Applied uses the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of valuing U.S. inventory. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.
There were no LIFO layer liquidation benefits recognized for the periods ended December 31, 2012 and 2011.
(2) On December 19, 2011, the Executive Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors froze participant benefits (credited service and final average earnings) and entry into the Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits Plan (SERP) effective December 31, 2011. As a result, we incurred a curtailment loss of approximately $3.1 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2011.

Applied Industrial Technologies Reports Fiscal 2013
Third Quarter Results and Declares Dividend
CLEVELAND, OHIO (May 2, 2013)
- Applied Industrial Technologies (NYSE: AIT) today reported third quarter fiscal 2013 sales and earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2013.
Net sales for the third quarter increased 2.7% to $621.7 million from $605.5 million in the comparable period a year ago. Net income for the quarter was $29.3 million, or $0.69 per share, essentially flat compared with the third quarter of 2012.
For the nine months ended March 31, 2013, sales increased 3.8% to $1.82 billion from $1.76 billion in the same period last year. Net income increased 11.9% to $85.9 million from $76.7 million, and earnings per share increased 12.8% to $2.02 per share from $1.79 per share, last year.
 
Commenting on the Company's performance, Applied's Chief Executive Officer Neil A. Schrimsher said, While some economic uncertainty persisted in our third quarter, we translated modest sales growth into solid earnings - benefiting from our business investments, efficiency gains and disciplined cost controls. While overall our third quarter sales trend remained similar to the prior quarter, we did see month-over-month increases in sales per day in our U.S. service center and fluid power businesses. Consistent with the current levels of various economic production and capacity utilization indices, we remain optimistic about the industrial economy for the 2013 calendar year.
We enter our fourth quarter debt free, with a strong balance sheet, and with a shared determination to serve our customers and profitably grow our business - organically, via acquisition and through our technology investments.
 
Looking ahead, we remain on track to meet our previously stated fiscal 2013 earnings guidance of $2.70 to $2.90 per share on sales growth expectations of 4% to 7%, said Schrimsher.
In addition, Mr. Schrimsher announced today that the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per common share, payable on May 31, 2013, to shareholders of record on May 15, 2013.
