Levine o Phone: (914) 244-0292 o Fax: (914) 244-0295 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AAON REPORTS HIGHER SALES AND LOWER EARNINGS Tulsa, OK, April 19, 2004 - AAON, Inc. (NASDAQ-AAON) today announced its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2004, of $37.5 million in sales and $2.3 million of net income, $0.18 per share, compared to $32.9 million in sales and $3.5 million of net income, $0.26 per share a year ago. Per share earnings are on a diluted basis. Norman H. Asbjornson, President and CEO, stated that "The decrease in earnings was attributable primarily to an 11.5% decline in gross profit from $8.7 million (or 26.5% of net sales) in 2003 compared to $7.7 million (or 20.5% of net sales) in 2004 and a $771,000 (24.1%) increase in SG&A (from $3.2 million in 2003 to $4.0 million in 2004)." He noted that "The drop in gross profit was principally due to the continuation of startup costs associated with a new coil project and sharp increases in steel and copper prices. These higher material costs are expected to further impact profitability for the remainder of the year. However, price increases which go into effect in April together with anticipated reduction of start-up costs of the new coil project, should more than offset these increased raw material costs by the third quarter. He said that, "The increase in SG&A was mainly the result of additional warranty expense on repairs of older units, which will continue at a reduced amount in the second quarter of 2004, and an increase in bad debt expense." Mr. Asbjornson pointed out that, "Net sales for the first quarter of 2004 increased by $4.6 million or 14.1% compared to the first quarter of 2003." He said that, "In spite of such sales increase, backlog has continued to rise to its current record level." He added that, "Based on our current backlog level and improving outlook for the U.S. economy, we believe sales should remain higher in 2004, compared to 2003." This press release contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Statements regarding future prospects and developments are based upon current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

(NASDAQ-AAON) today announced that it expects to report record sales for the second quarter ended June 30, 2004, while net income will be substantially less than the first quarter of 2004. The higher sales are attributable to a record backlog and some contribution of revenues from AAON Canada, Inc., acquired on May 5, 2004, despite closings of the Company's Tulsa plant for four days during the period due to computer and electrical outages. The lower earnings resulted from the continued impact of higher steel and copper prices and startup costs associated with a new coil project, a loss incurred by AAON Canada, Inc., equipment failures at the Company's Longview, Texas plant, which prevented coil production needed by the Tulsa facility, and the above-referenced plant closings. This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Statements regarding future prospects and developments are based upon current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. 1

(NASDAQ-AAON) today announced operating results for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 2004. In the quarter, revenues reached a record level, $43,019,000, up 15.6% from $37,222,000 during the corresponding period in 2003, and net income decreased 53.2% to $1,571,000 or $0.12 per share compared to $3,357,000 or $0.25 per share for the same period a year ago.

The lower earnings resulted from the continued impact of higher steel and copper prices and startup costs associated with a new coil project, equipment failures at the Company's Longview, Texas plant, which prevented coil production needed by the Tulsa facility, and the above-referenced plant closings, all of which combined to reduce margins from 23.7% in the second quarter of 2003 to 14.8% in 2004; and AAON Canada, Inc., incurred a loss of approximately $100,000." Net sales for the first six months of 2004 were up 14.9%, $80,513,000, compared to $70,078,000 in 2003, whereas earnings were down 43.0% from $6,852,000 or $0.51 per share, compared to $3,908,000 or $0.30 per share.

Determinations by the Bank for the purpose of this Section 2.11 of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs of making or maintaining Loans or on amounts receivable by it in respect of the Loans, and of the additional amounts required to compensate the Bank in respect of any Additional Costs, shall be conclusive, provided that such determinations are made on a reasonable basis. 2.12.

In the event Bank determines that (1) compliance with any judicial, administrative, or other governmental interpretation of any law or regulation or (2) compliance by the Bank or any corporation controlling the Bank with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law) has the effect of requiring an increase in the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by the Bank or any corporation controlling the Bank, and the Bank determines that such increase is based upon its obligations hereunder, and other similar obligations, the Borrower shall pay to the Bank such additional amount as shall be certified by the Bank to be the amount allocable to the Bank's obligations to the Borrower hereunder.

EXHIBIT "A" NEWS BULLETIN FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 19, 2004 AAON, Inc. 2425 South Yukon Ave. o Tulsa, OK 74107-2728 o Ph: (918) 583-2266 o Fax: (918) 583-6094 o o http://www.aaon.com o --------------------------------------------- For Further Information: Jerry R. Levine o Phone: (914) 244-0292 o Fax: (914) 244-0295 Email: jerry.levine@worldnet.att.net - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- AAON REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RECORD SALES AND LOWER EARNINGS Tulsa, OK, October 19, 2004 - AAON, Inc. (NASDAQ-AAON) In the quarter, revenues reached a record level, $47,733,000, up 16.4% from $41,003,000 during the corresponding period in 2003, and net income decreased 58.0% to $1,527,000 or $0.12 per share compared to $3,635,000 or $0.27 per share for the same period a year ago. Norman H. Asbjornson, President and CEO, stated that, "due to further increases in material costs during the third quarter, recent product price increases did not yield the anticipated margin improvement and additional product price increases will be necessary. It is unclear what impact further product price increases will have on sales volume in the future." Net sales for the first nine months of 2004 were up 15.5%, $128,246,000, compared to $111,081,000 in 2003, whereas earnings were down 48.2% from $10,487,000 or $0.79 per share, to $5,435,000 or $0.42 per share. All per share earnings are on a diluted basis. Mr. Asbjornson said, "sales in the third quarter, together with the Company's current backlog, will produce record second half of 2004 and yearly sales; however, due to ongoing material cost increases, earnings in the second half of 2004 will only approximate earnings in the first half of the year." Certain statements in this news release may be "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Statements regarding future prospects and developments are based upon current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

(NASDAQ-AAON) today announced its operating results for the year 2004. Sales increased 16% to $173.3 million from $148.9 million in 2003, whereas net income decreased 47% to $7.5 million compared to $14.2 million in the previous year. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 increased to $45.0 million from $37.8 million in 2003, and net income for the quarter declined to $2.1 million compared to $3.7 million in 2003. Earnings per share for 2004 were $0.58 compared to $1.07 in 2003. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2004 were $0.16 per share compared to $0.29 per share in the previous year. Per share earnings are on a diluted basis. Norman H. Asbjornson, AAON's President/CEO, stated that, "The decrease in 2004 earnings was caused by a number of factors, including startup costs involved with a new coil project in the first and second quarters, closings of the Company's Tulsa plant for four days during the second quarter due to computer and electrical outages, as well as second quarter equipment failures at the Company's Longview, Texas plant, which reduced coil production needed by the Tulsa facility, and a 2004 loss of approximately $900,000 generated by AAON Canada Inc., all of which should be non-recurring, but further, and most importantly, unprecedented increases in material costs greatly in excess of product price increases." Mr. Asbjornson continued by saying, "While we project even greater sales in 2005, we cannot predict the level of expected earnings due to a number of factors, including the prospect of continued high material costs." AAON, Inc. is a manufacturer of air-conditioning and heating equipment consisting of rooftop units, chillers, air-handling units, make-up air units, heat recovery units, condensing units and coils. Its products serve the new construction and replacement markets. The Company has successfully gained market share by offering the customer value, quality, function, serviceability and efficiency.

(NASDAQ-AAON) today announced its operating results for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 2006. In the quarter, revenues were a record high of $59,137,000, up 30.3% from $45,394,000 during the corresponding period in 2005, and net income increased 10.6% to $3,455,000 or $0.27 per share compared to $3,125,000 or $0.24 per share for the same period a year ago. Per share earnings are on a diluted basis. Norman H. Asbjornson, President and CEO, stated that, "The increase in sales was attributable to an increase in the commercial and industrial construction activity, the Company's new and redesigned products being favorably received by its customers, and price increases during 2006." He said, "The increase in earnings resulted from both higher volume and price increases, partially offset by continuing material cost increases which decreased gross margins." Net sales for the first six months of 2006 were up 27.9%, $112,757,000, compared to $88,174,000 in 2005, and earnings increased by 12.3% to $7,198,000 or $0.57 per share, compared to $6,412,000 or $0.50 per share. Mr. Asbjornson said that, "Based upon our current record backlog of orders and the continuing trend of strong incoming orders, we believe that our full year 2006 total sales will be significantly above the 2005 level. The Company is currently seeing a moderating environment of raw material and component pricing and, if this trend continues, it should enable the Company to achieve improvement in gross margins over the remainder of the year." Certain statements in this news release may be "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933. Statements regarding future prospects and developments are based upon current expectations and involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.

Reference is made to the Third Restated Revolving Credit Loan Agreement dated as of July 30, 2004, by and between Borrower and Lender (as amended July 30, 2005, July 30, 2006, and July 30, 3007, the "Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which currently exists a $15,150,000 Revolving Credit Loan. B. Borrower has requested that Lender extend the maturity of the $15,150,000 Revolving Credit Loan, and Lender has agreed to such request, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below. AGREEMENT For valuable consideration received, Borrower and Lender agree to the following: 1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Amendment (including capitalized terms used in the Recitals) that are not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement. 2. Amendments to Third Restated Revolving Credit Loan Agreement. 2.1. Section 1.36 (Prime Rate) is hereby deleted and replaced with the following: "1.36. "Prime Rate" means a rate which is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an index which is the BOKF National Prime Rate, described as the rate of interest set by BOK Financial Corporation, in its sole discretion, on a daily basis as published by BOK Financial Corporation ("BOKF") from time to time (the "Index"). The Index is not necessarily the lowest rate charged by Lender on its loans and is set by Lender in its sole discretion. If the Index becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index after notifying Borrower. Lender will tell Borrower the current index rate upon Borrower's request. The interest rate change will not occur more often than each day. Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based on other rates as well. NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this Note be more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. Whenever increases occur in the interest rate, Lender, at its option, may do one or more of the following: (A) increase Borrower's payments to ensure Borrower's loan will pay off by its original final maturity date, (B) increase Borrower's payments to cover accruing interest, (C) increase the number of Borrower's payments, and (D) continue Borrower's payments at the same amount and increase Borrower's final payment." (1)
2.2. Section 1.41 (Termination date) is hereby amended to evidence the date "July 30, 2008" shall now mean and read "July 30, 2009." 2.3. Subsection (1) of Section 2.51 (Rates) is hereby deleted and replaced with the following: "(1) For a Prime Loan at a rate equal to the Prime Rate less seventy-five hundredths percent (.75%), floating, per annum." 2.4. Section 7.1 (Tangible Net Worth) is hereby amended to evidence the amount "$55,000,000" shall now mean and read "$75,000,000". 2.5. Section 7.2 (Total Liabilities to Tangible Net Worth) is hereby amended to evidence the ratio "1.5 to 1.0" shall now mean and read "2.0 to 1.0". 2.6.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Tulsa, OK, May 8, 2012  AAON, Inc. (NASDAQ-AAON) today announced its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2012, of $65.0 million in sales (up 8%), and $4.6 million of net income (up 25%), $0.18 per share, compared to $59.9 million in sales and $3.7 million in net income, $0.15 per share, a year ago. Per share earnings are on a diluted basis.
Norman H. Asbjornson, President and CEO, stated, The increase in revenues reflects a continuation of gains in market share, while the much greater increase in earnings was attributable to: improved productivity due to our new sheet metal fabrication equipment and revamped production lines, which resulted in an improvement of gross margins from 19.4% to 20.8%, despite continued material cost increases; aided by the absence of a special expense in 2012 comparable to the $500,000 insurance deductible paid in 2011; but reduced by $380,000 (or $0.02 per diluted share) due to the loss of expired federal income tax credits for research and development and our failure to qualify, during the period, for the domestic production activity tax credit.
Mr. Asbjornson said, Significantly, our increased market penetration has produced a 22% rise in our backlog from $48.1 million at March 31, 2011, to $58.7 million at March 31, 2012. In spite of a generally anticipated modest growth in the Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning market, I believe AAONs development in the past few years of new products, improved manufacturing machinery and facilities has given AAON a more advantageous and optimistic view of our future.
Mr. Asbjornson added, Based on the first quarter results and backlog, we expect 2012 to produce both higher sales and earnings than 2011.
The Company will host a conference call today at 4:15 P.M. EDT to discuss the first quarter results. To participate, call 1-877-737-1669 (Code: VA27085).

Tulsa, OK, August 8, 2012  AAON, Inc. (NASDAQ-AAON), today announced its operating results for the second quarter and six-month period ended June 30, 2012.
Sales and earnings during the second quarter were record highs for any quarter in the Companys 24-year history.
Revenues in the quarter were $83.3 million, up 21% from $69.1 million in 2011. Net income was $9.3 million, up 142% from $3.8 million in the same period a year ago. Net sales for the first six months of 2012 were also a record for any six-month period, $148.3 million, up 15% compared to $129.0 in 2011. Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2012, were $13.9 million, up 85% compared to $7.5 million in 2011.
Earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012 were $0.38, up 153% from $0.15 for the same period a year ago, based upon 24.7 million and 24.9 million diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to June 30, 2011, respectively. Earnings per diluted share were $0.56, up 87% from $0.30, based upon 24.8 million and 24.9 million diluted shares outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to June 30, 2011, respectively.
Norman H. Asbjornson, President and CEO, stated, The increases in revenues primarily reflect gains in market share, while the much greater increases in earnings for the second quarter and first half of 2012, were attributable to significantly improved productivity due to our new sheet metal fabrication equipment and revamped production lines, which resulted in improvements of gross margins from 17.0% to 25.3% in the second quarters of 2011 and 2012, respectively, and 18.1% to 23.3% for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2012. Our backlog at June 30, 2012, was $62.2 million compared to $59.7 million at the same time a year ago.
Mr. Asbjornson said that, We are pleased with the results of the first half of 2012, which were aided by extremely strong order input. However, there are a number of uncertainties, particularly as to the level of future order input, which make it difficult to forecast the business climate AAON will encounter during the second half of the year.
The Company will host a conference call today at 4:15 P.M. EST to discuss the second quarter results. To participate, call 1-877-737-1669 (Code: VA34474).

Norman H.

TULSA, OK, May 9, 2013  AAON, INC. (NASDAQ-AAON), today announced its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2013, of $66.8 million in sales (up 3%), and $7.1 million of net income (up 56%), $0.29 per share, compared to $65.0 million in sales and $4.6 million in net income, $0.18 per share, a year ago. Per share earnings are on a diluted basis.
Both sales and earnings were records for the first quarter. However, net income for the first quarter of 2013 benefited by a $1.6 million reduction of the income tax provision, or $0.07 per share, largely due to an Oklahoma investment credit and change in Federal tax laws.  The Company anticipates an effective tax rate of 34.5% for the balance of this year (vs. 14.6% in the first quarter of 2013 and 39.9% in 2012).
Norman H. Asbjornson, President and CEO, stated, The first quarter increases in sales and income from operations primarily reflect price increases, although gross profit increased 2.1% (from 20.8% to 22.9%), while SG&A expenses also increased 1.2% (from 9.2% to 10.4%), a majority of which (SG&A) represents increased advertising expense and cash bonuses to employees which are not expected to occur during the rest of 2013.
Mr. Asbjornson pointed out that the Companys backlog increased from $58.9 million at March 31, 2012, to a record of $71.7 million at March 31, 2013, or by 22%.
Mr. Asbjornson said, Based on the first quarter results and backlog, we expect 2013 to produce both higher sales and earnings than 2012.
The Company will host a conference call today at 4:15 P.M. EDT to discuss the first quarter results. To participate, call 1-877-737-1669 (Code: VA23770).
