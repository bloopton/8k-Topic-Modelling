[ASTORIA LETTERHEAD] NEWS RELEASE CONTACT: PETER J. CUNNINGHAM FIRST VICE PRESIDENT, INVESTOR RELATIONS 516-327-7877 ir@astoriafederal.com FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION EXPECTS LOWER EPS GROWTH FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FULL YEAR; NEW GUIDANCE FOR THE 2002 3Q IS $0.72 - $0.74 PER SHARE AND FOR THE FULL YEAR IS $2.85 - $2.90 PER SHARE Lake Success, New York, September 10, 2002 -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) announced today that it expects third quarter diluted earnings per share ("EPS") to be lower than the current First Call and IBES consensus estimates of $0.77 per share. The Company indicated that, assuming interest rates and mortgage loan refinance activity remain unchanged, it is likely that third quarter EPS will be in a range of $0.72 - $0.74 per share, which represents growth of between 20% - 23% over the 2001 third quarter. The Company attributed the lower EPS growth to the impact of the sustained low level of interest rates, particularly after the decline during the summer, that, among other things, is resulting in historically high mortgage loan and mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") prepayments and low yielding reinvestment opportunities. The Company also noted that if interest rates and cash flow continue at current levels for the remainder of the year, that fourth quarter EPS will likely be within the third quarter EPS range announced today. With these assumptions, EPS guidance for 2002 would range from $2.85 - $2.90 per share, down from previous guidance of $2.95 - $3.00 per share. The lower earnings range would result in growth of 21% - 23% over 2001 EPS. Commenting on the current outlook, George L. Engelke, Jr., Astoria's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "While we are continuing to benefit from lower interest rates on the liability side of the balance sheet, cash flows from mortgage loan and MBS prepayments have recently accelerated dramatically, exceeding our previous estimates. The low level of interest rates and extraordinarily high levels of cash flow have slowed the growth of our net interest margin and EPS.
We are now expecting our 2002 third quarter margin to be up 9% - 11% over the 2001 third quarter and up 6% - 8% for the full year. On a linked quarter basis, the margin will be somewhat lower. Clearly, any modest increase in interest rates, which are currently at historic lows, will improve our earnings outlook." ASSET QUALITY REMAINS EXCELLENT The Company noted that asset quality remains very high with no adverse trends being noted. At August 31, 2002, non-performing assets totaled $31.5 million and represented 0.14% of total assets, below the levels reported at June 30, 2002. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS This document contains a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements may be identified by the use of such words as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "outlook," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "should," "will," "would" and similar terms and phrases, including references to assumptions. Forward-looking statements are based on various assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our management's experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control; there may be increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins; changes in deposit flows, loan demand or real estate values may adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines may cause our financial condition to be perceived differently; general economic conditions, either nationally or locally in some or all other areas in which we do business, or conditions in the securities markets or the banking industry may be less favorable than we currently anticipate; legislation or regulatory changes may adversely affect our business; applicable technological changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; success or consummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; or litigation or matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, may delay the occurrence or non-occurrence of events longer than we anticipate. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.

For the 2002 third quarter, returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets increased to 15.72%, 17.81% and 1.14%, respectively, from 14.17%, 16.12% and 1.00%, respectively, for the comparable 2001 period.

Included in the 2002 third quarter and nine month results is the benefit derived from the adoption of SFAS No. 142, which eliminated goodwill amortization of $4.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share, per quarter. The 2001 nine month results include a charge reflecting the cumulative effect of an accounting change, net of tax, of $2.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, related to the implementation of SFAS No. 133 in the 2001 first quarter.

Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, said, "The continued decline in long term interest rates during the third quarter accelerated the flattening of the U.S Treasury yield curve resulting in unprecedented mortgage loan and MBS prepayments, lower yielding reinvestment opportunities and somewhat less than a commensurate benefit on the liability side of the balance sheet. Notwithstanding these events, Astoria generated double digit earnings growth over the prior year and solid returns for the third quarter." BOARD DECLARES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 16, 2002 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share. The dividend is payable on December 2, 2002 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2002. This is the thirtieth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. ISSUANCE OF $200 MILLION SENIOR NOTES The Company, on October 16, 2002, completed the previously announced issuance of $200 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2012, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including stock repurchases. EIGHTH STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM CONTINUES; NINTH STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED During the third quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $29.84 per share. In addition, following the close of the third quarter, the Company purchased an additional 185,000 shares of its common stock. To date, under the eighth program that commenced in September 2001, Astoria has repurchased 7.4 million shares. 2
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors, at their October 16, 2002 meeting, approved the Company's ninth stock repurchase program which authorizes the purchase of an additional 10 million shares, or approximately 11% of its outstanding common stock in open-market or privately negotiated transactions over a two year period. The newly approved repurchase program will commence immediately following the completion of the eighth repurchase program in which approximately 2.6 million shares remain. BALANCE SHEET SUMMARY & TRENDS Assets at September 30, 2002 totaled $21.9 billion compared to $22.0 billion at the end of the previous quarter and $22.7 billion at December 31, 2001. Key balance sheet highlights outlining the cumulative effect of the Company's balance sheet repositioning since December 31, 1999 follow: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA) Mortgage loan originations and purchases for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 totaled $1.3 billion, compared to $1.2 billion for the comparable 2001 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, loan volume increased 30% to $4.0 billion from $3.1 billion for the 2001 comparable period. For the quarter ended September 30, 2002, 1-4 family loans, predominantly 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans, represented 75% of mortgage originations; 25% of mortgage originations were multifamily and commercial real estate ("CRE") loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, 80% of loan originations were 1-4 family loans and 19% were multifamily and CRE loans. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2002, multifamily and CRE loan originations increased to $313.9 million and $761.0 million, respectively, up 104% and 92%, respectively, over the 2001 comparable periods. The combined portfolios of multifamily and CRE loans grew during the first nine months of 2002 at an annualized rate of 40% to $2.2 billion, or 18% of total loans at September 30, 2002. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio is less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value. The average loan outstanding in that portfolio is 3
under $1 million. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending efforts are reflected in the growth of this portfolio since 1999: Commenting on these solid results, Mr. Engelke said, "We have achieved great success in building a top quality, low-risk multifamily and commercial real estate loan portfolio and expect to continue to produce strong, double-digit growth in the future. By the end of 2003, we expect this portfolio to increase to approximately 25% of total loans." Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 increased dramatically and totaled $1.2 billion as compared to $826.2 million for the previous quarter and $680.1 million for the 2001 third quarter. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2002, mortgage loan prepayments totaled $3.0 billion as compared to $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2001. Due to the historically high level of mortgage loan prepayments, the total loan portfolio decreased slightly during the third quarter to $12.4 billion from $12.5 billion at the end of the 2002 second quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, the loan portfolio increased $253.5 million from $12.2 billion at December 31, 2001. At September 30, 2002, non-performing loans declined to $32.3 million, or 0.15% of total assets, from $32.4 million, or 0.15% of total assets, at June 30, 2002 and $37.1 million, or 0.16% of total assets, at December 31, 2001. Net charge-offs for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2002 were $258,000 and $944,000, respectively, or an annualized rate of one basis point of average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 259% at September 30, 2002 compared to 258% at June 30, 2002 and 222% at December 31, 2001. Commenting on the superior asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, "The quality of our assets continues to remain excellent as evidenced by our very low level of loan delinquencies and non-performing assets. Net charge-offs for this year's third quarter and nine months were negligible and are indicative of our conservative lending policies and the fact that over 99% of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate with a loan-to-value ratio averaging less than 64%, based upon original appraised value and current principal balance." Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") totaled $6.8 billion at September 30, 2002, a decrease of $283.6 million from December 31, 2001 and an increase of $111.3 million from June 30, 2002. For the quarter ended September 30, 2002, MBS repayments totaled $1.4 billion compared to $948.5 million in the 2002 second quarter and $837.2 million for the 2001 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002 MBS repayments totaled $3.8 billion compared to $1.9 billion for the comparable 2001 period. Deposits were down slightly from June 30, 2002 and were up $276.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 to $11.2 billion at September 30, 2002. Core deposits, which exclude certificate of deposit accounts, totaled $5.9 billion, representing 53% of total deposits at September 30, 2002, 4
compared to $5.7 billion at December 31, 2001. Checking account balances for the 2002 third quarter increased $44.4 million from the previous quarter and totaled $1.3 billion, or 22% of core deposits, at September 30, 2002. The success of our small business banking initiatives was reflected in the strong growth in business deposits, including business savings and checking accounts. At September 30, 2002, business deposits totaled $216.9 million, up 44% from September 30, 2001. Borrowings at September 30, 2002 totaled $8.6 billion. The following table details future borrowing maturities and weighted average rates: In addition to the above maturities, an opportunity is available for lowering our cost of funds over the next twelve months as approximately $2.4 billion of CDs with an average rate of 3.02% will mature. During the month of September 2002, CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 1.76%. Overall, these opportunities will help mitigate the decline in the yield on interest earning assets resulting from the high level of prepayment and refinance activity currently being experienced. Stockholders' equity was $1.6 billion, or 7.23% of total assets, at September 30, 2002 compared to $1.5 billion, or 6.81% of total assets, at December 31, 2001. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of applicable regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2002, core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios were 7.04%, 7.04% and 15.14%, respectively. THIRD QUARTER AND NINE-MONTH EARNINGS SUMMARY Net interest income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2002 totaled $119.2 million and $362.7 million, respectively, compared to $114.2 million and $355.7 million for the comparable 2001 periods. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 was 2.31%, up 19 basis points from the 2001 third quarter margin of 2.12%, and declined 9 basis points from the previous quarter. Mr. Engelke noted, "The year over year margin improvement is primarily the result of the downward repricing of CDs and the repayment of borrowings. For the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the average (1) Included are $5.7 billion of borrowings that have a maturity date after September 30, 2003 but can be called prior to December 31, 2002. 5
cost of retail deposits declined 124 basis points from the 2001 third quarter and declined 15 basis points from the previous quarter this year, to 2.56%. Contributing to the decline during the third quarter of 2002 was the maturity of $857.9 million of non-jumbo CDs, with an average rate of 3.47% and an average maturity at inception of 13 months, and the issuance or repricing of $794.0 million of non-jumbo CDs with an average rate of 2.54% and an average maturity of 15 months. On a linked quarter basis, 4 basis points of the decline in the net interest margin is due to an extra day of interest expense in the third quarter." Non-interest income, excluding the gain on sale of securities, for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 rose to $28.5 million from $26.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2001. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002, non-interest income, excluding the gain on sale of securities in the third quarter, totaled $84.9 million compared to $75.2 million for the comparable 2001 period. The increases for the quarter and nine months in non-interest income, excluding gains on sales of securities, are primarily due to increases in customer service fees and BOLI income, partially offset by a decrease in loan servicing fees. Customer service fees for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2002 increased 16% and 18%, respectively, to $15.6 million and $44.9 million, respectively, from $13.5 million and $38.1 million, respectively, for the 2001 comparable periods. Gains on sales of securities for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 totaled $8.5 million, and were used as a natural hedge to offset most of the increase in net amortization of mortgage servicing rights caused by a valuation adjustment of $9.1 million related to the current lower interest rate environment and projected accelerated loan prepayment speeds. There were no gains on sales of securities in prior quarters or prior year periods. For the quarter ended September 30, 2002, general and administrative expense ("G&A") totaled $48.4 million, compared to $43.4 million for the comparable prior year period and $50.0 million for the previous quarter. The increase from the 2001 quarter is primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expense of $4.2 million. On a linked quarter basis, G&A expense decreased $1.6 million, due primarily to lower advertising expense and a lower mark to market adjustment on interest rate caps. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2002, G&A totaled $146.2 million, compared to $132.5 million in the prior year period. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, which includes increased employee stock plan amortization, and other expense, which includes market valuation adjustments on interest rate caps. Excluding G&A, non-interest expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2002 increased to $15.1 million from $11.0 million for the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net amortization of mortgage servicing rights due to a valuation adjustment of $9.1 million related to the current lower interest rate environment and projected accelerated loan prepayment speeds, offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization due to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in January 2002. For the nine months ended September 30, 2002 non-interest expense, excluding G&A, totaled $27.0 million compared to $33.6 million for the comparable 2001 period. The decrease resulted primarily from the elimination of goodwill amortization and lower goodwill litigation expense, offset by an increase in net amortization of mortgage servicing rights due to net valuation adjustments of $10.2 million. 6
The efficiency ratio for the 2002 third quarter was 32.74% compared to 32.56% for the 2002 second quarter and 30.72% for the comparable quarter last year. FOURTH QUARTER 2002 OUTLOOK Commenting on the current operating environment, Mr. Engelke stated, "Despite the difficult operating environment we are currently experiencing due to the flattened U.S Treasury yield curve and the absolute low level of interest rates, we are reiterating our 2002 fourth quarter earnings per share guidance of between $0.72 - $0.74 per share, which represents an 18% - 21% increase over the 2001 fourth quarter EPS. Clearly, any modest increase in long-term interest rates will improve our earnings outlook."

Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, said, "I am pleased to report double-digit earnings growth in both the fourth quarter and year despite the extraordinarily high level of mortgage loan and MBS repayments that accelerated through the fourth quarter and resulted in more than 50% of our assets being redeployed at lower rates during the year." BOARD DECLARES QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND The Board of Directors of the Company, at their January 22, 2003 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share. The dividend is payable on March 3, 2003 to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2003. This is the thirty-first consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. EIGHTH STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM COMPLETED; NINTH STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM COMMENCES During the fourth quarter, Astoria completed its eighth stock repurchase program and immediately commenced its previously announced ninth program, purchasing a combined 3.1 million shares of its common stock under both programs at an average cost of $26.20 per share. For 2002, the Company repurchased 7.3 million of its common shares at a cost of $211.1 million, or $28.98 per share. Under the 2
ninth program, 9.6 million of common shares remain authorized for repurchase. ISSUANCE OF $250 MILLION OF SENIOR NOTES During the 2002 fourth quarter, as previously announced, the Company issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due 2012. The proceeds are to be used for general corporate purposes, including stock repurchases. BOARD SETS ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING DATE The Board of Directors, at their January 22, 2003 meeting, established May 21, 2003 as the date for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a record date of March 26, 2003. BALANCE SHEET SUMMARY & TRENDS Assets at December 31, 2002 totaled $21.7 billion compared to $21.9 billion at the end of the previous quarter and $22.7 billion at December 31, 2001. Key balance sheet highlights including the cumulative effect of the Company's balance sheet repositioning since December 31, 1999 follow: Mortgage loan originations and purchases for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the comparable 2001 period and $1.3 billion for the 2002 third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter mortgage loan production were one-to-four family mortgage loans totaling $1.3 billion, predominantly 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans. For the full year 2002, loan volume increased $1.0 billion to a record $5.6 billion, of which 81% were one-to-four family mortgage loans, predominantly 3/1 and 5/1 ARMs. For the quarter ended December 31, 2002, multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $249.2 million compared to $195.8 million for the 2001 fourth quarter and $313.9 million for the 2002 third quarter. For the full year 2002, multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $1.0 billion, an increase of $418.4 million, or 71%, over 2001 originations. The combined portfolios of multifamily and CRE loans grew 39% to $2.3 billion, or 19% of total loans at December 31, 2002. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolios is less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value. The average loan outstanding in these portfolios is under $1 million. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending capabilities are reflected in the growth of this portfolio since 1999: 3
"This past year was one of spectacular growth in multifamily and commercial real estate lending. This was accomplished without any change in our focus on top quality, low credit risk lending standards. We will continue our strong growth in multifamily and CRE lending and expect these portfolios to approximate 25% of total loans by the end of 2003," Mr. Engelke noted. Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 increased to $1.5 billion compared to $1.1 billion for the 2001 fourth quarter and $1.2 billion for the previous quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2002, mortgage loan prepayments totaled $4.5 billion as compared to $3.0 billion for the full year 2001. Due to the historically high level of mortgage loan prepayments, the total loan portfolio decreased slightly during the year to $12.1 billion from $12.2 billion at December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, non-performing loans declined to $34.5 million, or 0.16% of total assets, from $37.1 million, or 0.16% of total assets, at December 31, 2001. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 were $102,000. For the full year 2002, net charge-offs were $1.0 million, or one basis point of average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 242% at December 31, 2002 compared to 222% at December 31, 2001. Commenting on the superior asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, "The quality of our assets continues to remain excellent as evidenced by our very low level of loan delinquencies and non-performing assets. Net charge-offs for the year were negligible, which is indicative of our conservative lending policies and the fact that over 99% of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate with a loan-to-value ratio averaging less than 64%, based upon current principal balance and original appraised value." Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") totaled $7.4 billion at December 31, 2002, an increase of $305.5 million from December 31, 2001 and $589.1 million from September 30, 2002. For the quarter ended December 31, 2002, MBS repayments totaled $2.3 billion compared to $1.1 billion for the 2001 fourth quarter and $1.4 billion for the 2002 third quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2002, MBS repayments totaled $6.1 billion compared to $3.0 billion for the comparable 2001 period. Deposits were up $163.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 to $11.1 billion and were down $113.4 million on a linked quarter basis. Core deposits, which exclude certificate of deposit accounts, increased to $5.9 billion from $5.7 billion at December 31, 2001 and represent 53% of total deposits at December 31, 2002. Checking account balances at December 31, 2002 increased 15% to $1.4 billion from December 31, 2001 and represent 23% of core deposits at December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, the average checking account balance was $4,000, an increase of 8% from $3,700 at the end of 2001. Additionally, the success of our small business banking initiatives was reflected in the strong growth of business deposits, including business savings and checking accounts. At December 31, 2002, business deposits totaled $220.3 million, up 38% from December 31, 2001. 4
Borrowings declined $1.0 billion during 2002 and totaled $8.8 billion at December 31, 2002. The following table details future borrowing maturities and weighted average rates: In addition to the above maturities, over the next twelve months approximately $2.4 billion of CDs with an average rate of 2.88% will mature. During the month of December 2002, CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 1.53%. Stockholders' equity was $1.6 billion, or 7.16% of total assets, at December 31, 2002 compared to $1.5 billion, or 6.81% of total assets, at December 31, 2001. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of applicable regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2002, core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios were 7.23%, 7.23% and 15.44%, respectively. FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR EARNINGS SUMMARY Net interest income for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2002 totaled $111.0 million and $464.4 million, respectively, compared to $110.6 million and $457.0 million for the comparable 2001 periods. During the fourth quarter, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the effect of converting our $125 million of capital trust securities ("Securities") from a 9.75% fixed rate instrument into a variable rate, LIBOR-based instrument. As a result of this transaction, the Securities were reclassified as borrowings and the capital securities expense, previously classified as non-interest expense, was reclassified as interest expense. All prior periods have been restated to conform to the current presentation. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2002 increased to 2.16%, or 11 basis points over the 2001 fourth quarter margin of 2.05% and decreased 9 basis points from the restated margin of 2.25% for the previous quarter. Seven of the nine basis point decrease from the linked quarter is attributable to the $250 million senior debt issued in the fourth quarter. The year over year improvement in the net interest margin is a result of the cost of deposits and borrowings declining more rapidly than the - -------- (1) Included are $5.4 billion of borrowings that have a maturity greater than one year but can be called prior to March 31, 2003. 5
decline in asset yields. For the quarter ended December 31, 2002, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities declined 84 basis points from the 2001 fourth quarter to 3.67% while the average yield on interest-earning assets declined only 61 basis points to 5.77%. Non-interest income for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2002 rose 37% and 19%, respectively, to $30.9 million and $107.4 million from $22.6 million and $90.1 million, for the respective periods in 2001. The increases for the quarter and year are primarily due to increases in customer service fees, net gain on sales of securities, BOLI income and the receipt in the 2002 fourth quarter of a $3.8 million net insurance settlement regarding the previously disclosed Weil litigation. Customer service fees for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2002 increased 10% and 16%, respectively, to $15.3 million and $60.2 million, respectively, from $13.9 million and $52.0 million, respectively, for the 2001 comparable periods. Included in non-interest income is mortgage banking income, net, the components of which are detailed below: * Previously classified as non-interest expense During the 2002 fourth quarter, a gain on sales of securities of $2.3 million was recognized in order to offset an anticipated increase in the mortgage servicing valuation allowance. Since such valuation allowance increase was minimal, we used the gain on the sale of securities to offset a prepayment penalty of $2.2 million incurred on the prepayment of $100 million of high cost borrowings. The following table details the fourth quarter and full year offsets to MSR valuation adjustments: For the quarter ended December 31, 2002, general and administrative expense ("G&A") totaled $48.8 million, compared to $44.1 million for the prior year period. The increase from the 2001 quarter is primarily due to increased compensation and pension expense. For the year ended December 31, 2002, G&A totaled $195.8 million, compared to $178.8 million for 2001. The increase was due primarily to increased compensation and pension expense, increased employee stock plan amortization and negative market valuation adjustments on interest rate caps. The efficiency ratio for the 2002 fourth quarter was 34.42% compared to 33.09% for the 2001 fourth 6
quarter. For 2002, the efficiency ratio was 34.25% compared to 32.68% in 2001. FUTURE OUTLOOK Commenting on the current operating environment, Mr. Engelke stated, "We are operating in a unique financial atmosphere with interest rates at forty-year lows, major geopolitical uncertainties and a lackluster economy. We currently anticipate the continuation of the existing low interest rate environment and the extraordinarily high levels of cash flow throughout the first half of 2003. Accordingly, we expect quarterly earnings in the first half of 2003 to resemble the 2002 fourth quarter results excluding the impact of the Weil litigation insurance settlement. Our current projections are for interest rates to rise and cash flows to recede in the second half of the year. If that transpires, earnings growth should resume. If a continuation of the current environment persists, we would not expect any significant growth in earnings during 2003 and might experience some downward pressure on earnings. Clearly, if interest rates increase earlier, positive earnings momentum will resume earlier." EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL, JANUARY 24 AT 9:30 A.M. (ET) The Company will host an earnings conference call tomorrow morning, January 24 at 9:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss fourth quarter and full year operating results.

The dividend is payable on June 2, 2003 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2003. This is the thirty-second consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Ninth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the first quarter, Astoria repurchased 2.1 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $25.42 per share. To date, under the ninth program that commenced November 2002, Astoria has repurchased 2.7 million shares of the 10 million shares authorized.

Included in the first quarter 2003 mortgage loan production were one-to-four family loans totaling $1.2 billion, predominantly 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate loans. Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 totaled $1.3 billion compared to $1.0 billion for the 2002 first quarter. Importantly, for the quarter ended March 31, 2003, multifamily and CRE loan originations increased to $235.3 million, or 23% over the 2002 first quarter. The multifamily and CRE loan portfolios grew during the first quarter at an annualized rate of 19% to $2.5 billion, or 21% of total loans at March 31, 2003. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loans continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. The portfolios are expected to approximate 25% of total loans by the end of 2003. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending capabilities are reflected in the growth of this portfolio since 1999: Change (Dollars in millions) 12/31/99- 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 3/31/03 3/31/03 Multifamily/CRE Loans $1,014 $1,282 $1,693 $2,345 2,458 +142% % of Total Loans 10% 11% 14% 20% 21% +110% At March 31, 2003, non-performing loans totaled $39.0 million, or 0.17% of total assets compared to $34.5 million, or 0.16% of total assets, at December 31, 2002. Subsequent to the close of the first quarter of 2003, a $3.2 million loan, just classified non-performing at March 31, 2003, became current. Net charge-offs for the 2003 first quarter totaled only $92,000, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of the average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at March 31, 2003 was 214%. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") totaled $8.8 billion at March 31, 2003, an increase of $1.4 billion from December 31, 2002. This increase reflects the deployment of cash flows that are currently exceeding loan production levels into MBS purchased at little, if any, premiums and with projected average lives of approximately 31/2 years. Importantly, the mortgage loan pipeline at the end of the first quarter totaled $2.8 billion compared to $1.8 billion at the end of the previous quarter. Deposits for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 increased $190.9 million to $11.3 billion. Importantly, checking account deposits at March 31, 2003 increased at an annualized rate of 26% on a linked quarter basis and 19% year over year. Checking account balances totaled $1.5 billion, or 25% of core deposits at March 31, 2003. During the first quarter 20,000 new checking accounts were opened. Complementing the strong growth in the number of accounts, the average checking account balance has grown from $3,700 at March 31, 2002 to $4,200 at March 31, 2003. Additionally, the success of our small business banking initiatives was reflected in the strong growth of business deposits, including business savings and checking accounts. At March 31, 2003, business deposits totaled $226.8 million, representing an increase at an annualized rate of 12% on a linked quarter basis and 21% from a year ago. Commenting on the Company's checking account and business deposit growth, Mr. Engelke stated, "The superior demographics of our retail banking franchise, in conjunction with concerted sales and marketing efforts, have enabled us to grow deposits, particularly checking account deposits, the linchpin for building long-term customer relationships. The double-digit growth in checking accounts is impressive considering that our checking accounts pay, on average, 0.14% interest compared to interest rates of between 2% and 3% offered by several major competitors over the past year." Borrowings totaled $9.4 billion at March 31, 2003, an increase of $563.6 million from the prior quarter end. While we have made significant strides over the past several years to reduce our borrowing to deposit ratio as well as to reduce our overall level of borrowings, during the first quarter low interest rate environment we borrowed $500 million with medium-term maturities at rates averaging approximately 21/2% to provide protection against future interest rate increases. The following table details borrowing maturities: Contractual Total Amount Weighted Maturity Maturing Average Rate 2Q03 $ 1.1 Billion 2.24% 3Q03 $ 350 Million 5.30% 4Q03 $ 800 Million 5.81% 1Q04 $ 2.8 Billion 4.97% Total next 12 months $ 5.1 Billion 4.53% Beyond 1Q04 $ 4.3 Billion 5.29% Total(1) $ 9.4 Billion 4.88% (1) Included are $2.6 billion of borrowings that have a maturity greater than one year but can be called prior to March 31, 2004. In addition to the above maturities, over the next twelve months approximately $2.6 billion of CDs with an average rate of 2.75% will mature. During the first quarter of 2003, $907.3 million of CDs, with an average rate of 2.46% and an average maturity of 12 months, matured and $1.1 billion of CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 2.18% and an average maturity of 17 months. Stockholders' equity was $1.5 billion, or 6.87% of total assets at March 31, 2003. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 7.25%, 7.25% and 15.71%, respectively, at March 31, 2003. First Quarter 2003 Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 totaled $109.0 million compared to $114.9 million for the 2002 first quarter. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 was 2.09% compared to 2.16% for both the prior quarter and the quarter ended March 31, 2002. The decline in the net interest margin was due to the repurchase of 8.2 million shares over the past twelve months and the more rapid decline in the yield on interest earning assets than the cost of interest bearing liabilities due to the high level of mortgage loan and MBS repayments. Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 totaled $25.9 million compared to $27.0 million for the comparable 2002 quarter. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking income, net, as described below, partially offset by a net gain on sales of securities and increased customer service fees. Customer service fees for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 totaled $14.8 million compared to $13.9 million for the comparable 2002 quarter. The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 1Q03 1Q02 Loan servicing fees $2.3 $3.2 Amortization of MSR* (3.8) (2.1) MSR valuation adjustments (0.9) 0.8 Net gain on sale of loans 2.8 1.5 Mortgage banking income, net $0.4 $3.4 *Mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") During the 2003 first quarter, a net gain on sales of securities of $2.1 million was recognized in order to offset an anticipated increase in the mortgage servicing valuation allowance. No gain on sales of securities was recognized in the 2002 first quarter. General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended March 31, 2003 totaled $52.0 million compared to $48.1 million for the comparable 2002 period. The increase is primarily due to increased compensation and benefit expense, particularly pension expense, and occupancy, equipment and systems expense, due, among other things, to increased depreciation as a result of facilities and systems enhancements over the past year. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2003, Mr. Engelke stated, "The current operating environment remains challenging due to sustained low interest rates and continued economic uncertainties. We now anticipate the continuation of the existing low interest rate environment and the extraordinarily high levels of cash flow to persist throughout most of 2003, which will result in some margin compression and modest downward pressure on earnings. Clearly, if interest rates increase and cash flows recede, positive earnings momentum should resume. We will remain focused on building our core businesses, with particular emphasis on growing checking account and business deposits and our multifamily and CRE loan portfolios."

Exhibit 99.1 Astoria Financial Corporation Announces Second Quarter EPS of $0.64; Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.22 Per Common Share Declared LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 17 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $50.9 million, or $0.64 diluted earnings per common share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, compared to net income of $63.9 million, or $0.73 diluted earnings per common share, for the 2002 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, net income totaled $107.3 million, or $1.33 diluted earnings per common share, compared to $125.1 million, or $1.41 diluted earnings per common share for the comparable 2002 period. Second Quarter 2003 Highlights: Financial: * Diluted EPS: $0.64 * Return on average assets: 0.88% * Return on average equity: 13.27% * Return on average tangible equity: 15.09% * Efficiency ratio: 40.57% * Non-performing assets to total assets ratio: 0.16% * Shares repurchased: 2.5 million Retail Banking: * Total checking account deposits increased to $1.5 billion, up 20% from June 30, 2002 * 18,000 new checking accounts opened; 79,000 opened over the last twelve months * Business deposits increased to $245.4 million, up 14% from June 30, 2002 Mortgage Lending: * 1-4 family loan volume of $1.6 billion, 82% increase over 2002 second quarter * Multifamily/commercial real estate ("CRE") loan volume of $413.3 million, 62% increase over 2002 second quarter * Multifamily/CRE portfolios increased to $2.6 billion, up 31% from June 30, 2002 and represent 22% of total loans * Home equity and other loan portfolios increased to $411.8 million, up 38% from June 30, 2002 and represent 3% of total loans Commenting on the second quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "The challenging interest rate and economic environment has resulted in the continuation of abnormally high levels of cash flow from refinancing activity. A net gain on sales of securities of $8.0 million was recognized to offset the increase in the mortgage servicing valuation allowance, a portion of the negative effect of the reduced net interest margin and the effect of our decision not to add leverage to the balance sheet. We continue to experience growth in substantially all of our core businesses, particularly with respect to consumer and business checking accounts and multifamily and CRE lending." Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 16, 2003 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per common share. The dividend is payable on September 2, 2003 to shareholders of record as of August 15, 2003. This is the thirty-third consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. The annualized dividend yield, based on the share price as of July 15, 2003, is 3.07%. Ninth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the second quarter, Astoria repurchased 2.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $25.30 per share. To date, under the ninth program that commenced November 2002, Astoria has repurchased 5.1 million shares of the 10 million shares authorized. Balance Sheet Summary Key balance sheet highlights including the cumulative effect of the Company's balance sheet repositioning since December 31, 1999 follow: Change 12/31/99- (Dollars in 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 3/31/03 6/30/03 6/30/03 millions) Assets $22,697 $22,337 $22,668 $21,698 $22,491 $22,283 - 2% Loans $10,286 $11,422 $12,167 $12,059 $11,873 $12,044 +17% MBS $ 9,287 $ 7,875 $ 7,074 $ 7,380 $ 8,817 $ 8,597 - 7% Deposits $ 9,555 $10,072 $10,904 $11,067 $11,258 $11,309 +18% Core Deposits(1) $ 4,625 $ 4,922 $ 5,743 $ 5,914 $ 5,842 $ 5,824 +26% Checking Deposits $ 878 $ 1,005 $ 1,200 $ 1,383 $ 1,472 $ 1,511 +72% Borrowings $11,524 $10,320 $ 9,822 $ 8,821 $ 9,385 $ 9,191 -20% (1) Excludes time deposits Mortgage loan originations and purchases for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 totaled $2.0 billion compared to $1.2 billion for the 2002 second quarter. Included in the second quarter 2003 mortgage loan production were one-to-four family loan originations totaling $1.6 billion. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, mortgage loan originations and purchases totaled $3.5 billion compared to $2.7 billion for the comparable 2002 period. Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $1.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, compared to $826.2 million and $1.8 billion for the respective 2002 periods. The mortgage loan pipeline at the end of the second quarter totaled $3.2 billion compared to $1.5 billion at the end of the 2002 second quarter. Importantly, for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, multifamily and CRE loan originations increased 62% over the 2002 second quarter volume to $413.3 million. For the six month period ended June 30, 2003, multifamily and CRE originations totaled $648.6 million, a 45% increase over the 2002 six month period volume. At June 30, 2003, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolios totaled $2.6 billion, or 22% of total loans, up 31% from last year. The combined portfolios are expected to approximate 25% of total loans by the end of 2003. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loans continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending capabilities are reflected in the growth of this portfolio since 1999: Change 12/31/99- (Dollars in 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 3/31/03 6/30/03 6/30/03 millions) Multifamily/ CRE Loans $1,014 $1,282 $1,693 $2,345 $2,458 $2,633 +160% % of Total Loans 10% 11% 14% 20% 21% 22% +120% At June 30, 2003, non-performing loans totaled $36.0 million, or 0.16% of total assets compared to $39.0 million, or 0.17% of total assets at March 31, 2003 and $32.4 million, or 0.15% of total assets at June 30, 2002. Net charge-offs for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled only $64,000 and $156,000, respectively, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of the average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at June 30, 2003 was 232%. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") decreased $219.8 million from the first quarter and totaled $8.6 billion at June 30, 2003. The decrease was attributable to MBS repayments of $1.9 billion and sales of $619.8 million, offset by purchases of $2.3 billion. When interest rates begin to rise and refinance activity recedes, we expect to resume a more aggressive balance sheet repositioning with our loan portfolio expanding and our MBS portfolio contracting through normal cash flow. Deposits for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003 increased $51.0 million and $242.0 million, respectively, to $11.3 billion. Importantly, checking account deposits totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2003 and reflected annualized growth of 11% on a linked quarter basis and 20% year over year. During the second quarter 18,000 new checking accounts were opened. Complementing the growth in the number of accounts, the average checking account balance has grown from $3,700 at June 30, 2002 to $4,300 at June 30, 2003. Additionally, the success of our small business banking initiatives was reflected in the strong growth of business deposits, including business savings and checking accounts. At June 30, 2003, business deposits totaled $245.4 million, representing an increase at an annualized rate of 33% on a linked quarter basis and 14% from a year ago. Commenting on the Company's checking account and business deposit growth, Mr. Engelke stated, "The success of our concerted sales and marketing efforts has enabled us to grow both business and consumer checking account deposits, the linchpin for building long-term customer relationships." Borrowings totaled $9.2 billion at June 30, 2003, a decrease of $193.7 million from the prior quarter end. In addition, $300 million in short-term borrowings were extended for an average of 3.7 years at an average rate of 2.29%. A total of $5.1 billion of high cost borrowings, with an average rate of 4.74%, are scheduled to mature within the next 12 months and are expected to either be repaid or reprice at substantially lower rates which should result in a significant decline in the cost of funds. For example, at July 15, 2003 the fixed borrowing rates for advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York for various terms were as follows: 1 Year - 1.25% 4 Year - 2.61% 2 Year - 1.65% 5 Year - 3.02% 3 Year - 2.12% The following table details borrowing maturities and their weighted average rates: Contractual Total Amount Weighted Maturity Maturing Average Rate 3Q03 $ 965 Million 2.63% 4Q03 $ 800 Million 5.81% 1Q04 $ 2.8 Billion 4.97% 2Q04 $ 500 Million 5.80% Total next 12 months $ 5.1 Billion 4.74% Beyond 2Q04(1) $ 4.1 Billion 5.01% Total $ 9.2 Billion 4.86% In addition to the above borrowing maturities, over the next twelve months approximately $2.7 billion of CDs with an average rate of 2.59% will mature. During the second quarter of 2003, $896.7 million of CDs, with an average rate of 2.30% and an average maturity of 12 months, matured and $915.6 million of CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 1.71% and an average maturity of 15 months. The following table details retail CDs maturing over the next twelve months along with weighted average rates: CDs Maturing Amount Weighted Average Rate 3Q03 $ 725 Million 2.08% 4Q03 $ 660 Million 2.74% 1Q04 $ 752 Million 2.84% 2Q04 $ 574 Million 2.76% Total $ 2.7 Billion 2.59% Stockholders' equity was $1.5 billion, or 6.86% of total assets at June 30, 2003. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 7.59%, 7.59% and 16.13%, respectively, at June 30, 2003. Second Quarter and Six Month Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 totaled $96.3 million compared to $109.0 million on a linked quarter basis and $122.4 million for the 2002 second quarter. Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2003 was $205.3 million compared to $237.3 million for the comparable 2002 period. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 was 1.78% compared to 2.09% on a linked quarter basis and 2.34% for the prior year quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the net interest margin was 1.93% compared to 2.25% for the comparable 2002 period. The decline in the net interest margin was due, in part, to the repurchase of 9.3 million common shares over the past twelve months and the more rapid decline in the yield on interest earning assets than the cost of interest bearing liabilities. The decrease in the yield on interest earning assets was exacerbated by the effect of accelerated premium amortization expense on mortgage loans and MBS. Net premium amortization expense totaled $33.8 million for the 2003 second quarter compared to $9.4 million for the year ago second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, net premium amortization totaled $58.8 million compared to $19.4 million for the comparable 2002 period. The accelerated level of premium amortization is due to the unprecedented high level of mortgage refinance activity and is expected to recede as interest rates rise and as mortgage loan and MBS refinance activity subsides. Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 increased to $31.5 million from $24.3 million for the comparable 2002 quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2003 non-interest income increased to $57.4 million from $51.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2002. The increase is primarily due to the net gain on sales of securities and increased customer service fees, partially offset by a decrease in mortgage banking income, net, as described below. Customer service fees for the quarter ended June 30, 2003 increased to $15.8 million from $15.3 million for the comparable 2002 quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2003 customer service fees increased to $30.6 million compared to $29.3 million for the comparable 2002 period. The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 2Q03 2Q02 1H03 1H02 Loan servicing fees $ 2.1 $ 3.1 $ 4.4 $ 6.3 Amortization of MSR* (3.8) (1.9) (7.6) (4.0) MSR valuation adjustments (1.8) (1.9) (2.7) (1.1) Net gain on sale of loans 3.1 1.3 6.0 2.8 Mortgage banking income, net $(0.4) $ 0.6 $ 0.1 $ 4.0 *Mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") During the 2003 second quarter, a net gain on sales of securities of $8.0 million was recognized in order to offset the anticipated increase in the mortgage servicing valuation allowance of $1.8 million, which was less than initially projected, as well as to partially offset margin compression. For the six months ended June 30, 2003, net gain on sales of securities totaled $10.2 million. No gain on sales of securities was recognized in either the 2002 second quarter or six month period. General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003 totaled $51.8 million and $103.8 million, respectively, compared to $50.3 million and $98.4 million, respectively, for the comparable 2002 period. The increases are primarily due to increased compensation and benefit expense, particularly pension expense, and occupancy, equipment and systems expense. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for next twelve months, Mr. Engelke stated, "Although long term interest rates have risen somewhat over the past few weeks, the historically low rate environment we are operating in is projected to continue for at least the remainder of 2003. As a result, we expect to experience a continuation of the accelerated pace of loan and MBS prepayments resulting in high cash flow levels coupled with lower yielding reinvestment opportunities. Accordingly, we anticipate additional margin compression and continued downward pressure on earnings in the second half of 2003. The margin compression will be mitigated as the repricing or repayment of $5.1 billion of high cost borrowings occurs through the second quarter of 2004. In addition, when interest rates begin to increase, cash flow will slow due to lower mortgage loan and MBS prepayments and premium amortization expense will diminish, both of which will also contribute to margin expansion in 2004. Earnings will also improve as mortgage loan portfolio growth becomes more robust. Importantly, we will remain focused on building our core businesses, with particular emphasis on growing checking account and business deposits and our high quality multifamily and CRE loan portfolios." Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $22.3 billion, is the second largest thrift institution headquartered in New York and fifth largest in the United States.

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  These factors include, without limitation, the following:  the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control; there may be increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins; changes in deposit flows, loan demand or real estate values may adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines may cause our financial condition to be perceived differently; general economic conditions, either nationally or locally in some or all areas in which we do business, or conditions in the securities markets or the banking industry may be less favorable than we currently anticipate; legislation or regulatory changes may adversely affect our business; technological changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; success or consummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; or litigation or other matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, may delay occurrence or non-occurrence of events longer than we anticipate.

Astoria Financial Corporation Announces the Retirement of Its Senior Lending Officer LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, announced today that Thomas W. Drennan, 59, Executive Vice President and Senior Lending Officer of the Company will retire effective November 30, 2003. Mr. Drennan, a certified public accountant, has headed the Company's mortgage services division since 1986 when he joined Astoria Federal. Commenting on Mr. Drennan's retirement, George L. Engelke, Jr., Astoria's Chairman, President and CEO said, "Tom has been a friend and colleague of mine for nearly 38 years, going back to our tenure in public accounting where we worked together in an audit and tax group specializing in savings and loan associations. In his 17 year tenure at Astoria Federal, he has been instrumental in building the strong, top-quality mortgage lending franchise that we enjoy today." Gary T. McCann, 50, currently Senior Vice President and Director of Residential Lending, will be appointed Executive Vice President and Senior Lending Officer and succeed Mr. Drennan effective December 1, 2003. "Gary has worked closely with Tom since joining Astoria Federal in 1990. I am very confident in Gary's ability to continue to build our mortgage lending franchise, since he has been a major participant in that effort in his present position," Engelke continued. Commenting on his retirement, Mr. Drennan noted, "I leave Astoria Federal with mixed emotions. I have enjoyed my years at Astoria, especially the friendships I've made and the relationships I've developed with people at all levels within the Company, but have decided that it is time for me to spend more time with my wife, children and grandchildren. When I joined Astoria Federal in 1986, the Company produced approximately $185 million in loans for that year and had a loan portfolio of $1.8 billion. Today, our loan portfolio exceeds $12 billion and we are poised to originate more than $7 billion in loans for 2003. I am happy that I have been able to contribute to Astoria's success over the years and am pleased to have developed a high quality staff that will continue to serve the Company well."

Exhibit 99.1 Astoria Financial Corporation Announces Third Quarter EPS of $0.53 Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.22 Per Common Share Declared LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 16 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $41.6 million, or $0.53 diluted earnings per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, compared to $62.2 million, or $0.72 diluted earnings per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, net income totaled $148.9 million, or $1.85 diluted earnings per common share, compared to net income of $187.4 million, or $2.13 diluted earnings per common share for the comparable 2002 period. For the 2003 third quarter, returns on average equity and average assets were 11.35% and 0.74%, respectively, compared to 15.72% and 1.14%, respectively, for the comparable 2002 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, returns on average equity and average assets were 13.13% and 0.88%, respectively, compared to 15.92% and 1.13%, respectively, for the comparable 2002 period. Commenting on the third quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, said, "As anticipated, third quarter results were negatively impacted by the continued very high level of cash flow from mortgage refinance activity and accelerated premium amortization. However, based on lower mortgage refinance applications received in August, September and into October, refinance lending activity and related cash flows should slow in the fourth quarter." Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 15, 2003 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per common share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2003 to shareholders of record as of November 17, 2003. This is the thirty-fourth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. The annualized dividend yield, based on the share price as of October 15, 2003, is 2.69%. Ninth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the third quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $29.82 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, 6.0 million shares were repurchased at an average cost of $26.34 per share. To date, under the ninth program that commenced in November 2002, Astoria has repurchased 6.4 million shares of the 10 million shares authorized. Redemption of 12% Preferred Stock, Series B On October 1, 2003, the Company completed the redemption of all 2,000,000 outstanding shares of its 12% Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B (the "Preferred Shares"), at a redemption price of $27.25 per share, plus $1.00 in accrued and unpaid dividends, for an aggregate redemption price of $28.25 per Preferred Share (the "Redemption Price"). Balance Sheet Summary Key balance sheet highlights outlining the cumulative effect of the Company's balance sheet repositioning since December 31, 1999 follow: (Dollars in millions) Change 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 9/30/03 12/31/99-9/30/03 Assets $22,697 $22,337 $22,668 $21,698 $22,069 - 3% Loans $10,286 $11,422 $12,167 $12,059 $12,311 + 20% MBS $ 9,287 $ 7,875 $ 7,074 $ 7,380 $ 8,155 - 12% Deposits $ 9,555 $10,072 $10,904 $11,067 $11,213 + 17% Core Deposits* $ 4,625 $ 4,922 $ 5,743 $ 5,914 $ 5,727 + 24% Checking $ 878 $ 1,005 $ 1,200 $ 1,383 $ 1,480 + 69% Borrowings $11,524 $10,320 $ 9,822 $ 8,821 $ 9,074 - 21% * Excludes time deposits Mortgage loan production for the quarter ended September 30, 2003, fueled by high refinance activity, totaled $2.3 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for the comparable 2002 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, loan production increased 46% to $5.8 billion from $4.0 billion for the comparable 2002 period. Included in the 2003 third quarter and nine month loan production were one-to-four family loan originations totaling $1.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, predominantly 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans. Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $1.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, compared to $1.2 billion and $3.0 billion for the respective 2002 periods. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003, multifamily and commercial real estate ("CRE") loan originations increased to $556.6 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, up 77% and 58%, respectively, over the 2002 comparable periods. At September 30, 2003, the combined multifamily and CRE loan portfolios totaled $2.9 billion, up 33% from September 30, 2002, representing 24% of total loans. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio is less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value. The average loan outstanding remains under $1 million. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending efforts are reflected in the growth of this portfolio since 1999: (Dollars in Change millions) 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 9/30/03 12/31/99-9/30/03 Multifamily/ CRE Loans $1,014 $1,282 $1,693 $2,345 $2,916 +188% % of Total Loans 10% 11% 14% 20% 24% +140% Commenting on these solid lending results, Mr. Engelke said, "Our multifamily and CRE lending continues to exhibit strong growth. We have achieved great success in building a high quality multifamily and CRE loan portfolio and expect to continue to produce strong, double-digit growth in the future." At September 30, 2003, non-performing loans totaled $33.3 million, or 0.15% of total assets compared to $36.0 million, or 0.16% of total assets, at June 30, 2003 and $34.5 million, or 0.16% of total assets, at December 31, 2002. Net charge-offs for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003 were $185,000 and $341,000, respectively. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 250% at September 30, 2003. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") decreased by $442.2 million from June 30, 2003 and totaled $8.2 billion at September 30, 2003. The decrease was attributable to repayments of $2.5 billion, offset by purchases of $2.1 billion. Deposits were down slightly from June 30, 2003 and totaled $11.2 billion at September 30, 2003. Core deposits, which exclude certificate of deposit accounts, totaled $5.7 billion, representing 51% of total deposits at September 30, 2003. Borrowings at September 30, 2003 totaled $9.1 billion. The following table details future borrowing maturities and weighted average rates: Contractual Total Amount Weighted Maturity Maturing Average Rate 4Q03(1) $ 1.7 Billion 3.41% 1Q04 $ 2.8 Billion 4.97% 2Q04 $ 500 Million 5.80% 3Q04 $ -- 0 -- -- Total next 12 months $ 5.0 Billion 4.53% Beyond 3Q04(2) $ 4.1 Billion 5.01% Total $ 9.1 Billion 4.75% We entered into forward borrowing commitments for $900 million in the third quarter, the effect of which will be to extend borrowings with a weighted average rate of 5.29%, scheduled to mature in the 2003 fourth quarter, for an average term of 2.7 years, with a weighted average rate of 2.63%. The remaining high cost borrowings scheduled to mature within the next twelve months are expected to either be repaid or repriced at substantially lower rates which should result in a significant decline in the cost of funds. In addition to the above borrowing maturities, over the next twelve months approximately $2.7 billion of CDs with an average rate of 2.55% will mature. During the third quarter of 2003, $780.7 million of CDs, with an average rate of 2.01% and an average maturity of 12 months, matured and $731.5 million of CDs were issued or repriced with an average rate of 1.60% and an average maturity of 15 months. The following table details retail CDs maturing over the next twelve months along with weighted average rates: CDs Maturing Amount Weighted Average Rate 4Q03 $ 778 Million 2.45% 1Q04 $ 943 Million 2.45% 2Q04 $ 581 Million 2.73% 3Q04 $ 356 Million 2.77% Total $ 2.7 Billion 2.55% Stockholders' equity was $1.5 billion, or 6.68% of total assets, at September 30, 2003. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of applicable regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2003, core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of Astoria Federal were 7.52%, 7.52% and 15.66%, respectively. Third Quarter and Nine-Month Earnings Summary Net interest income for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2003 totaled $79.6 million and $284.9 million, respectively, compared to $116.1 million and $353.4 million, respectively, for the comparable 2002 periods. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 was 1.52% compared to 1.78% on a linked quarter basis and 2.25% for the comparable 2002 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the net interest margin was 1.79% compared to 2.25% for the comparable 2002 period. The decline in the net interest margin was due, in part, to the repurchase of 9.1 million common shares over the past twelve months and the more rapid decline in the yield on interest earning assets than the cost of interest bearing liabilities. The decrease in the yield on interest earning assets was exacerbated by the effect of accelerated net premium amortization expense on mortgage loans and MBS. Net premium amortization expense on mortgage loans and MBS totaled $34.7 million for the 2003 third quarter compared to $13.4 million for the year ago third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, net premium amortization totaled $93.6 million compared to $32.8 million for the comparable 2002 period. The accelerated level of net premium amortization is due to the unprecedented high level of mortgage refinance activity and should recede as interest rates rise and as mortgage loan and MBS refinance activity subsides. Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2003 totaled $33.9 million compared to $25.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2002. The increase is due to an increase in mortgage banking income, net, partially offset by lower gain on sales of securities in the 2003 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, non-interest income totaled $91.3 million compared to $76.5 million for the comparable 2002 period. The increase is due to increased mortgage banking income, net and increased gain on sales of securities. Gain on sales of securities for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003 were $4.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively, compared to $8.5 million for both the comparable quarter and nine months of 2002. The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non- interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 3Q03 3Q02 2003 Nine Months 2002 Nine Months Loan servicing fees $ 1.8 $ 3.1 $ 6.2 $ 9.5 Amortization of MSR $(3.0) $(2.7) $(10.6) $ (6.7) MSR valuation adjustments $ 2.9 $(9.1) $ 0.2 $(10.2) Net gain on sale of loans $ 4.3 $ 1.1 $ 10.2 $ 3.9 Mortgage banking income, net $ 6.0 $(7.6) $ 6.0 $( 3.5) General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2003 totaled $51.4 million and $155.2 million, respectively, compared to $48.6 million and $147.0 million, respectively, for the comparable 2002 periods. The G&A expense to average assets ratio for the 2003 third quarter was 0.92% compared to 0.89% a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003 the G&A expense to average assets ratio was 0.91% compared to 0.88% a year ago. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for next twelve months, Mr. Engelke stated, "We agree with the consensus for a gradual economic recovery in 2004. Real estate markets should remain fairly strong despite a substantial slowing of refinance activity. With refinance activity slowing, we can expect to realize a very significant earnings benefit as net premium amortization returns to more normal levels. Earnings will also benefit from the repricing of our borrowings at lower rates and the resumption of mortgage loan portfolio growth. Accordingly, we now expect earnings and the net interest margin in the fourth quarter to resemble the third quarter and to increase robustly during 2004."

EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description - -------------- ----------- 99.1 Press release dated January 22, 2004 which, among other things, highlights the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2003. 4

Exhibit 99.1 Astoria Financial Corporation Announces Fourth Quarter EPS of $0.63; Full Year EPS of $2.49 Quarterly Cash Dividend Increased 14% to $0.25 Per Common Share; Annual Meeting Date Set LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $48.0 million, or $0.63 diluted earnings per common share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, compared to net income of $61.1 million, or $0.73 diluted earnings per common share for the 2002 fourth quarter and $41.6 million, or $0.53 diluted earnings per common share, for the 2003 third quarter. For the 2003 fourth quarter, returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 13.58%, 15.63% and 0.84%, respectively, compared to 15.66%, 17.77% and 1.11%, respectively, for the comparable 2002 period, and 11.35%, 12.99% and 0.74%, respectively, for the 2003 third quarter. Net income for the full year 2003 totaled $196.8 million, or $2.49 diluted earnings per common share, compared to net income of $248.4 million, or $2.85 diluted earnings per common share for 2002. For 2003, returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 13.26%, 15.15%, and 0.87%, respectively, compared to 15.87%, 18.00% and 1.12%, respectively, for 2002. Commenting on the Company's results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, said, "As expected, the rise in long-term interest rates in the second half of 2003 has significantly reduced mortgage refinance activity and related net premium amortization. In addition, earnings have also started to benefit from the downward repricing of our maturing borrowings. As a result, we are beginning to realize a very positive effect on the net interest margin." Board Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend 14% The Board of Directors of the Company, at their January 21, 2004 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share, a 14% increase from the previous quarter's dividend. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2004 to shareholders of record as of February 17, 2004. This is the thirty-fifth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Ninth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the fourth quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $34.66 per share. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, 7.1 million shares were repurchased at an average cost of $27.63 per share. To date, under the ninth program that commenced in November 2002, Astoria has repurchased 7.4 million shares of the 10 million shares authorized, at an average price of $27.59 per share. Board Sets Annual Shareholders' Meeting Date The Board of Directors, at their January 21, 2004 meeting, established May 19, 2004 as the date for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a record date of March 26, 2004. Balance Sheet Summary & Trends Key balance sheet highlights including the cumulative effect of the Company's balance sheet repositioning since December 31, 1999 follow: (Dollars in millions) Change 12/31/99- 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 12/31/03 12/31/03 Assets $22,697 $22,337 $22,668 $21,698 $22,458 - 1% Loans $10,286 $11,422 $12,167 $12,059 $12,687 + 23% MBS $9,287 $7,875 $7,074 $7,380 $8,244 - 11% Deposits $9,555 $10,072 $10,904 $11,067 $11,187 + 17% Core Deposits* $4,625 $4,922 $5,743 $5,914 $5,685 + 23% Checking $878 $1,005 $1,200 $1,383 $1,493 + 70% Borrowings $11,524 $10,320 $9,822 $8,821 $9,628 - 16% * Excludes time deposits Mortgage loan originations and purchases for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 totaled $1.5 billion compared to $1.6 billion for the comparable 2002 period. Included in the fourth quarter mortgage loan production were one-to-four family mortgage loans totaling $1.0 billion, predominantly 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage ("ARM") loans. For the full year 2003, loan volume increased $1.7 billion to a record $7.3 billion, of which 76% was one-to-four family mortgage loans, predominantly 3/1 and 5/1 ARMs. For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, multifamily and commercial real estate ("CRE") loan originations increased 79% to $444.9 million from $249.2 million for the 2002 fourth quarter. For the full year 2003, multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $1.7 billion, an increase of $639.9 million, or 63%, over 2002 originations. The combined portfolios of multifamily and CRE loans grew $766.1 million, or 33% to $3.1 billion, or 25% of total loans at December 31, 2003. The average loan outstanding in the combined multifamily and CRE portfolio is under $1 million and the average loan-to-value ratio of this portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending capabilities are reflected in the growth of this portfolio since 1999: Change (Dollars in millions) 12/31/99- 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 12/31/03 12/31/03 Multifamily/ CRE Loans $1,014 $1,282 $1,693 $2,345 $3,111 +207% % of Total Loans 10% 11% 14% 20% 25% +150% "It is important to note that the substantial growth in our top-quality, low credit risk multifamily and CRE portfolios, capped by record loan originations in 2003, has been achieved while maintaining our strict underwriting standards. We expect solid growth in these portfolios to continue in 2004," Mr. Engelke noted. Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 decreased to $894.1 million compared to $1.5 billion for both the 2002 fourth quarter and the previous 2003 quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2003, mortgage loan prepayments totaled $5.2 billion as compared to $4.5 billion for the full year 2002. Despite the very high level of refinance activity in 2003, the total loan portfolio grew by $627.6 million and totaled $12.7 billion at December 31, 2003, primarily attributable to the substantial multifamily and CRE loan growth. At December 31, 2003, non-performing loans declined to $29.7 million, or 0.13% of total assets, from $34.5 million, or 0.16% of total assets, at December 31, 2002. Net charge-offs for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 were $84,000 and $425,000, respectively, or less than one basis point of average loans outstanding, compared to $102,000 and $1.0 million, respectively, for the comparable 2002 periods. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans increased to 280% at December 31, 2003 from 242% at December 31, 2002. Commenting on the superior asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, "The quality of our assets continues to remain excellent as evidenced by our very low level of loan delinquencies and non-performing assets. Net charge-offs for the year were negligible, which is also indicative of our conservative lending policies and the fact that over 99% of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate with a loan-to-value ratio averaging less than 65%, based upon current principal balance and original appraised value." Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") totaled $8.2 billion at December 31, 2003, essentially unchanged from the previous quarter, and increased $864.5 million from December 31, 2002. MBS repayments totaled $779.8 million for the 2003 fourth quarter compared to $2.3 billion for the 2002 fourth quarter and $2.5 billion for the 2003 third quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2003, MBS repayments totaled $6.9 billion compared to $6.1 billion for the comparable 2002 period. A detailed profile of the fixed rate MBS portfolio at December 31, 2003 follows: (Dollars in millions) Unamortized Book Value Premium/ Current Collateral Avg (Discount) Coupon Coupon Life Premium MBS $2,555 $27.2 5.07% 6.10% 2.7 yrs Discount/Par MBS $5,598 $(18.7) 4.15% 5.80% 3.6 yrs Total $8,153 $8.5 4.43% 5.93% 3.3 yrs Deposits were up $119.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 to $11.2 billion. Core deposits, which exclude certificate of deposit accounts, declined during 2003 to $5.7 billion from $5.9 billion, primarily due to a decrease in money market accounts which was partially offset by a $236.8 million increase in savings and checking accounts. Checking account balances increased to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2003, from $1.4 billion at December 31, 2002, and totaled 26% of core deposits. CD accounts increased $348.4 million in 2003 and totaled $5.5 billion at December 31, 2003. Borrowings at December 31, 2003 totaled $9.6 billion. The following table details future borrowing maturities and weighted average rates: Contractual Total Amount Weighted Maturity Maturing Average Rate 1Q04 (1) $ 1.3 Billion 1.11% 1Q04 $ 2.8 Billion 4.97% 2Q04 $ 500 Million 5.80% 3Q04 $ 20 Million 7.67% 4Q04 $ 105 Million 5.98% Total next 12 months $ 4.7 Billion 4.03% Beyond 2004 (2) $ 4.9 Billion 4.54% Total $ 9.6 Billion 4.29% (1) Overnight and other short-term borrowings. (2) Includes $2.2 billion of borrowings that have a maturity date greater than one year but can be called prior to December 31, 2004. In the fourth quarter, during which the average cost of borrowings declined by 38 basis points from the previous quarter to 4.39%, we entered into forward borrowing commitments totaling $500 million, the effect of which will be to extend a portion of the borrowings with a weighted average rate of 4.97%, scheduled to mature in the 2004 first quarter, for an average term of 3.3 years, at a weighted average rate of 3.05%. In addition, during the 2004 first quarter to date, we entered into forward borrowing commitments totaling $700 million, the effect of which will be to extend a portion of the borrowings with a weighted average rate of 4.97%, also scheduled to mature in the 2004 first quarter, for an average term of 3.7 years, at a weighted average rate of 3.01%. The remaining high cost borrowings scheduled to mature during 2004 are also expected to either be repaid or repriced at substantially lower rates which should result in a significant decline in the cost of funds. In addition to the above borrowing maturities, over the next twelve months approximately $2.7 billion of CDs with an average rate of 2.70% will mature. During the fourth quarter of 2003, $868.3 million of CDs, with an average rate of 2.46% and an average maturity at inception of 15 months, matured and $833.5 million of CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 2.10% and an average maturity of 18 months. The following table details CDs maturing over the next twelve months along with weighted average rates: CDs Maturing Amount Weighted Average Rate 1Q04 $ 1.1 Billion 2.26% 2Q04 $ 751 Million 2.28% 3Q04 $ 371 Million 2.69% 4Q04 $ 523 Million 4.19% Total $ 2.7 Billion 2.70% Stockholders' equity was $1.4 billion, or 6.22% of total assets, at December 31, 2003 compared to $1.6 billion, or 7.16% of total assets, at December 31, 2002. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of applicable regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2003, core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios were 7.37%, 7.37% and 15.39%, respectively. Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $94.6 million and $379.5 million, respectively, compared to $111.0 million and $464.4 million, respectively, for the comparable 2002 periods. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 increased to 1.74%, or 22 basis points, from the 2003 third quarter margin of 1.52%, and decreased 42 basis points from the margin of 2.16% for 2002 fourth quarter. The linked quarter improvement in the net interest margin is primarily the result of a decline in the cost of liabilities as higher cost borrowings and CDs were repriced at lower rates and an increase in earning asset yields caused primarily by a decline in premium amortization. With mortgage refinancing activity dramatically subsiding, the net premium amortization on mortgage loans and MBS declined 44% to $19.4 million for the 2003 fourth quarter from $34.7 million in the previous 2003 quarter. For details on premium amortization expense, please see the following chart: MBS and Mortgage Loan Premium Amortization Trends (Dollars in millions) 1Q02 2Q02 3Q02 4Q02 Total 2002 MBS $(0.1) $ 1.0 $ 3.5 $ 9.3 $13.7 Mtg Loans $10.1 $ 8.4 $ 9.9 $10.5 $38.9 Total $10.0 $ 9.4 $13.4 $19.8 $52.6 1Q03 2Q03 3Q03 4Q03 Total 2003 MBS $13.7 $21.9 $22.6 $12.7 $ 70.9 Mtg Loans $11.3 $12.0 $12.1 $ 6.7 $ 42.1 Total $25.0 $33.9 $34.7 $19.4 $113.0 For the quarter ended December 31, 2003, the average cost of interest- bearing liabilities declined 57 basis points from the 2002 fourth quarter, primarily due to lower repricing of borrowings and retail deposits, while the average yield on interest-earning assets declined 102 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to higher levels of mortgage refinance activity throughout 2003. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, the net interest margin was 1.78% compared to 2.23% a year ago. Contributing to the year over year decline was a $60.4 million, or 115%, increase in net premium amortization to $113.0 million for 2003 from $52.6 million a year ago and the effect of the high level of refinance activity throughout 2003 offset, in part, by a decline in the cost of liabilities of 73 basis points, primarily due to the lower repricing of borrowings and retail deposits. "We are finally seeing a rebound in the net interest margin for the first time in twelve months and we expect this trend will continue with incremental benefit to the margin accruing throughout 2004," Mr. Engelke noted. Offsetting to some extent the future benefit to be derived from lower premium amortization expense, multifamily and CRE prepayment penalty fee income is expected to decline due to lower refinance activity in these portfolios. The table below highlights prepayment penalty income over the past eight quarters: Multifamily and CRE Loan Prepayment Penalty Income (Dollars in millions) 2002 2003 1Q02 2Q02 3Q02 4Q02 Total 1Q03 2Q03 3Q03 4Q03 Total $0.9 $0.9 $1.4 $1.7 $4.9 $2.1 $3.5 $5.8 $4.6 $16.0 Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2003 totaled $28.2 million compared to $30.9 million for the 2002 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2003, non-interest income totaled $119.6 million compared to $107.4 million for 2002. Included in the 2003 fourth quarter non-interest income was a $10.1 million gain on the sale of a joint venture and a $3.0 million increase in mortgage banking income, net, due primarily to the recovery of the MSR valuation allowance, partially offset by a $7.3 million net loss on the sale of $484.6 million of MBS, primarily issues which were purchased at a premium. Included in last year's non-interest income was the receipt in the 2002 fourth quarter of a $3.8 million net insurance settlement. The year over year net increase is primarily due to the increase in mortgage banking income, net, as detailed in the table below. (Dollars in millions) 4Q02 4Q03 2002 2003 Loan servicing fees $2.6 $1.7 $12.1 $7.9 Amortization of MSR (3.5) (2.2) (10.2) (12.8) MSR valuation adjustments (0.6) 2.9 (10.8) 3.1 Net gain on sale of loans 2.8 1.9 6.6 12.1 Mortgage banking income, net $1.3 $4.3 $(2.3) $10.3 For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2003, general and administrative expense ("G&A") totaled $50.7 million and $205.9 million, respectively, compared to $48.8 million and $195.8 million, respectively, for the prior year periods. The G&A expense to average assets ratio for the 2003 fourth quarter and year was 0.89% and 0.91%, respectively, compared to 0.89% and 0.88%, respectively, for the comparable year ago periods. Future Outlook Commenting on the current operating environment, Mr. Engelke stated, "We are now just beginning to realize the positive benefits derived from lower premium amortization expense and lower borrowing costs. With mortgage refinance activity significantly reduced, premium amortization expense should return to more normalized levels. The reduced level of premium amortization, coupled with the incremental benefit yet to be derived from borrowings that have just recently been repriced lower and the expected benefit yet to be derived from the sizable amount of high rate borrowings which will be repaid or repriced at substantially lower rates this year, will significantly benefit net interest margin throughout 2004. At the same time, with reduced refinance activity and a projected continuation of a relatively steep Treasury yield curve, we expect to resume growth in our one-to-four family loan portfolio and continue to produce robust growth in our multifamily and CRE loan portfolios. This combination of events is expected to result in significant earnings growth throughout 2004."

Cunningham First Vice President and Director of Investor Relations Dated: April 22, 2004 EXHIBIT INDEX Exhibit Number Description 99.1 Press release dated April 22, 2004 which, among other things, highlights the Company's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004. 3

Exhibit 99.1 Astoria Financial Corporation Announces First Quarter EPS of $0.71 Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.25 Per Common Share Declared LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., April 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $53.4 million, or $0.71 diluted earnings per common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, compared to net income of $56.4 million, or $0.69 diluted earnings per common share, for the 2003 first quarter. For the 2004 first quarter, returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 15.05%, 17.31% and 0.95%, respectively, compared to 14.58%, 16.56% and 1.01%, respectively, for the comparable 2003 period. First Quarter 2004 Highlights: * Diluted EPS: $0.71, increased $0.08, or 13%, from linked quarter * Net interest margin: 2.14%, increased 40 basis points, or 23%, from linked quarter * Return on average assets: 0.95 %, up 13% from linked quarter * Return on average equity: 15.05 %, up 11% from linked quarter * Return on average tangible equity: 17.31%, up 11% from linked quarter * Total deposits increased $322.1 million, or 12% annualized * Multifamily/Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") loan portfolios increased $99.1 million, or 13% annualized, and represent 25% of total loans * Non-performing assets to total assets declined to 0.12% * Repurchased 1.0 million common shares Commenting on the first quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "The expansion of the net interest margin year over year, and, in particular, the forty basis point improvement from the previous quarter, reflects reduced premium amortization expense and significantly lower borrowing costs during the quarter." Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.25 Per Share The Board of Directors of the Company, at their April 21, 2004 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. The dividend is payable on June 1, 2004 to shareholders of record as of May 17, 2004. This is the thirty-sixth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Ninth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the first quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $39.03 per share. To date, under the ninth program that commenced November 2002, Astoria has repurchased 8.5 million shares of the 10 million shares authorized. First Quarter 2004 Earnings Summary - Net Interest Margin Improvement Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 totaled $114.5 million, an increase of 21% from $94.6 million in the 2003 fourth quarter and 5% from $109.0 million a year ago. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 increased forty basis points, on a linked quarter basis, to 2.14%, and five basis points from a year ago. The increases in the net interest margin were due to a decline in the cost of liabilities as higher cost borrowings were repriced at lower rates and a decline in premium amortization due to reduced refinance activity. With mortgage refinancing activity dramatically subsiding and lower MBS repayments in the 2004 first quarter, the net premium amortization on mortgage loans and MBS declined 67% to $8.3 million for the 2004 first quarter from $25.0 million for the year ago first quarter. Importantly, MBS net premium amortization declined 79% from the year ago first quarter to just $2.9 million in the 2004 first quarter. Linked quarter declines were also significant; for details on net premium amortization expense, please see the following chart: MBS and Mortgage Loan Net Premium Amortization Trends Year Over Year Linked Quarter (Dollars in millions) 1Q03 4Q03 1Q04 $Change %Change $Change %Change MBS $13.7 $12.7 $2.9 $ (10.8) (79%) $(9.8) (77%) Mortgage Loans $11.3 $6.7 $5.4 $(5.9) (52%) $(1.3) (19%) Total $25.0 $19.4 $8.3 $(16.7) (67%) $(11.1) (57%) The decline in the cost of liabilities was due primarily to the 2004 first quarter maturity of $2.8 billion of medium-term borrowings, with a weighted average rate of 4.97%, of which $2.4 billion were extended for a weighted average term of 3.3 years with a weighted average rate of 2.71%, $245 million were repaid and the remainder were refinanced with short-term borrowings. Over the past fifteen months $4.5 billion of medium-term borrowings, with a weighted average rate of 5.37%, matured and $4.1 billion of those borrowings were extended for a weighted average term of 3.2 years with a weighted average rate of 2.64%, providing protection against future interest rate increases. Also impacting the margin, multifamily and CRE prepayment penalty income declined 46% on a linked quarter basis to $2.5 million due to reduced refinance activity. The table below highlights the trend in multifamily/CRE prepayment penalty income over the past nine quarters: Multifamily and CRE Loan Prepayment Penalty Income (Dollars in millions) 1Q02 2Q02 3Q02 4Q02 1Q03 2Q03 3Q03 4Q03 1Q04 $0.9 $0.9 $1.4 $1.7 $2.1 $3.5 $5.8 $4.6 $2.5 Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 totaled $22.1 million compared to $25.9 million for the comparable 2003 quarter. The decrease is primarily due to a $1.5 million decrease in mortgage banking income, net, as described below, and a $1.1 million decrease in customer service fees, from $14.8 million for the 2003 first quarter to $13.7 million for the 2004 first quarter, primarily due to a decrease in debit card interchange fees caused by a reduction in the fee structure on signature-based debit card transactions. The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 1Q04 1Q03 Loan servicing fees $1.5 $2.3 Amortization of MSR* (2.0) (3.8) MSR* valuation adjustments (1.3) (0.9) Net gain on sale of loans 0.7 2.8 Mortgage banking income, net $(1.1) $0.4 *Mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") Net gain on sales of securities totaled $2.4 million for the 2004 first quarter compared to $2.1 million for the year ago first quarter. The gains were recognized during the quarter to offset anticipated mortgage servicing valuation adjustments calculated at quarter end totaling $1.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 totaled $57.0 million compared to $52.0 million for the comparable 2003 period. The increase is primarily due to increased compensation and benefit expense and occupancy, equipment and systems expense, due to, among other things, facilities and systems enhancements over the past year. Balance Sheet Summary Key balance sheet highlights, including the cumulative effect of the Company's balance sheet repositioning since December 31, 1999, follow: (Dollars in millions) 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 Assets $22,700 $22,341 $22,672 $21,702 Loans $10,286 $11,422 $12,167 $12,059 MBS $9,287 $7,875 $7,074 $7,380 Deposits $9,555 $10,072 $10,904 $11,067 Core Deposits (1) $4,625 $4,922 $5,743 $5,914 Checking $878 $1,005 $1,200 $1,383 Borrowings $11,528 $10,324 $9,826 $8,825 Change (Dollars in millions) 12/31/03 3/31/04 12/31/99 - 3/31/04 Assets $22,462 $22,651 -- Loans $12,687 $12,737 + 24% MBS $8,244 $8,169 - 12% Deposits $11,187 $11,509 + 20% Core Deposits (1) $5,685 $5,628 + 22% Checking $1,493 $1,505 + 71% Borrowings $9,632 $9,395 - 19% (1) Excludes time deposits Mortgage loan originations and purchases for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 totaled $867.3 million compared to $1.5 billion for the 2003 first quarter. Included in the first quarter 2004 mortgage loan production were one-to-four family loans totaling $617.3 million, predominantly 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate loans. The decrease in loan production was due to reduced mortgage loan refinance activity in the 2004 first quarter. Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 totaled $648.2 million compared to $1.3 billion for the 2003 first quarter. For the quarter ended March 31, 2004, multifamily and CRE loan originations increased to $240.0 million compared to $235.3 million a year ago. The multifamily and CRE loan portfolios grew during the first quarter at an annualized rate of 13% to $3.2 billion, or 25% of total loans at March 31, 2004. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. Commenting on the multifamily and CRE loan volume, Mr. Engelke noted, "During the first quarter, we witnessed irrational pricing of multifamily loan products by several local competitors which resulted in lower than anticipated loan production. We will continue to remain focused on producing quality multifamily and CRE loans but will maintain our rational pricing discipline." The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending capabilities are reflected in the growth of these portfolios since 1999: (Dollars in millions) 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 Multifamily/CRE Loans $1,014 $1,282 $1,693 $2,345 % of Total Loans 10% 11% 14% 20% Change (Dollars in millions) 12/31/03 3/31/04 12/31/99 - 3/31/04 Multifamily/CRE Loans $3,111 $3,210 +217% % of Total Loans 25% 25% +150% At March 31, 2004, non-performing loans declined to $24.6 million, or 0.11%, of total assets from from $39.0 million, or 0.17% of total assets a year ago, and from $29.7 million, or 0.13% of total assets, at December 31, 2003. Net charge-offs for the 2004 first quarter totaled just $155,000, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of the average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at March 31, 2004 increased to 337%. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") totaled $8.2 billion at March 31, 2004, a decrease of $648.1 million from the year ago quarter end. Of the total, $2.5 billion, equal to 11% of assets, were categorized as available-for-sale. A detailed profile of the premium/discount associated with our fixed rate CMO/REMIC MBS portfolio at March 31, 2004 follows: Unamortized Premium/ Collateral Weighted (Dollars in millions) Book Value (Discount) MBS Coupon Coupon Avg Life Premium CMO/ REMIC MBS $2,274 $ 22.7 5.01% 6.06% 2.0 yrs Discount/Par CMO/ REMIC MBS $5,725 $(18.0) 4.14% 5.85% 2.8 yrs Total $7,999 $4.7 4.39% 5.91% 2.5 yrs Deposits for the quarter ended March 31, 2004 increased $322.1 million, or 12% on an annualized basis, to $11.5 billion from $11.2 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase of $378.8 million in CD accounts to $5.9 billion from $5.5 billion at December 31, 2003. This increase reflects the success of a marketing campaign in the first quarter focused on attracting long-term deposits to enable us to reduce borrowings. Specifically, $1.2 billion of CDs, with an average rate of 2.33% and an average original maturity of 14 months matured and $1.5 billion of CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 2.51% and an average maturity of 22 months. "We expect to continue our strategy of lengthening the maturity of our CD deposits in the current interest rate environment," Mr. Engelke noted. Checking account balances totaled $1.5 billion, or 27% of core deposits at March 31, 2004. Additionally, our small business banking initiatives continue to result in solid growth in our business deposits which, at March 31, 2004, totaled $253.2 million, up 27% on an annualized basis. Borrowings declined $237.2 million from the previous quarter and totaled $9.4 billion at March 31, 2004. Stockholders' equity was $1.4 billion, or 6.36% of total assets at March 31, 2004. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 7.19%, 7.19% and 14.98%, respectively, at March 31, 2004. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2004, Mr. Engelke stated, "We are well positioned to continue to project solid growth in earnings and related returns as a result of the actions taken in 2003 and the first quarter of 2004 to significantly reduce the cost of our liabilities and lengthen the terms of both borrowings and CDs. In addition, with significantly reduced refinance activity and a projected continuation of a relatively steep Treasury yield curve, even in a slightly higher interest rate environment we anticipate solid growth in both our loan portfolio and deposits."

Second Quarter 2004 Highlights: Financial: * Diluted EPS: $0.78, up 22% from last year, up 10% from linked quarter * Return on average assets: 1.03%, up 17% from last year, up 8% from linked quarter * Return on average equity: 16.55%, up 25% from last year, up 10% from linked quarter * Return on average tangible equity: 19.09%, up 27% from last year, up 10% from linked quarter * Total deposits increased $387.0 million, or 13% annualized * Multifamily/Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") loan portfolio increased $97.2 million, or 12% annualized, and represents 26% of total loans * Efficiency ratio: 39.21% * Non-performing assets to total assets: 0.12% * Shares repurchased: 1.5 million Commenting on the second quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "We are pleased to report double-digit increases in quarterly net income, earnings per share, and related returns, due, primarily, to a 35 basis point increase in the net interest margin year over year. Second quarter results were somewhat tempered by the decline in interest rates at the end of the first quarter which sparked an increase in mortgage refinance activity and a resulting increase in mortgage repayment cash flow in the second quarter. As a result, net premium amortization was higher than expected in the second quarter, negatively impacting margin expansion, and the total loan portfolio reflected a modest decline. Net premium amortization of $12.7 million in the second quarter, $4.4 million higher than the 2004 first quarter, was offset by a recovery of $5.2 million in the MSR valuation allowance which is included in mortgage banking income, net. Importantly, we are currently experiencing much lower refinance activity due to the increase in interest rates during the second quarter which should translate into a resumption of loan growth and lower premium amortization going forward." Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 21, 2004 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. The dividend is payable on September 1, 2004 to shareholders of record as of August 16, 2004. This is the thirty-seventh consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Ninth Stock Repurchase Program Completed; Tenth Repurchase Program Commenced During the second quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $36.30 per share. On July 9, 2004, Astoria completed the 10 million share authorization under the ninth repurchase program and commenced its tenth repurchase program, as previously announced, which authorizes the repurchase of eight million shares, or approximately 10% of total shares outstanding.

For the six months ended June 30, 2004, mortgage loan originations and purchases totaled $2.1 billion compared to $3.5 billion for the comparable 2003 period and include one-to-four family loan originations and purchases of $1.6 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. The decrease in mortgage loan volume was due to reduced mortgage loan refinance activity due to higher interest rates in 2004 as compared to 2003. Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004 totaled $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, compared to $1.4 billion and $2.7 billion for the respective 2003 periods. For the quarter ended June 30, 2004, multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $274.0 million compared to the 2003 second quarter volume of $413.3 million. For the six month period ended June 30, 2004, multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $514.1 million compared to $648.6 million for the 2003 six month period volume. At June 30, 2004, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolios totaled $3.3 billion, up $97.2 million from the 2004 first quarter and $674.4 million, or 26%, from June 30, 2003, and represent 26% of total loans. The average loan-to-value ratio of the combined multifamily and CRE loan portfolios continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending capabilities are reflected in the growth of these portfolios since 1999: (Dollars in millions) 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 Multifamily/CRE Loans $1,014 $1,282 $1,693 $2,345 % of Total Loans 10% 11% 14% 20% Change (Dollars in millions) 12/31/03 6/30/04 12/31/99-6/30/04 Multifamily/CRE Loans $3,111 $3,307 +226% % of Total Loans 25% 26% +160% At June 30, 2004, non-performing loans totaled $26.5 million, or 0.12% of total assets compared to $36.0 million, or 0.16% of total assets at June 30, 2003. Net charge-offs for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004 totaled $148,000 and $303,000, respectively, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at June 30, 2004 was 313%. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") increased slightly from March 31, 2004, decreased $392.6 million from the year ago second quarter, and totaled $8.2 billion at June 30, 2004. Of the total, $2.5 billion, equal to 11% of assets, are categorized as available-for-sale. A detailed profile of the premium/discount associated with our fixed rate CMO/REMIC MBS portfolio at June 30, 2004 follows: (Dollars in millions) Unamortized Premium/ Collateral Weighted Book Value (Discount) MBS Coupon Coupon Avg Life Premium CMO/ REMIC MBS $ 1,841 $ 17.2 4.98% 6.03% 3.6 yrs Discount/Par CMO/REMIC MBS $ 6,296 $(22.6) 4.18% 5.80% 4.6 yrs Total $ 8,137 $(5.4) 4.36% 5.85% 4.4 yrs Deposits for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 increased $387.0 million, or 13% on an annualized basis, to $11.9 billion from $11.5 billion at March 31, 2004. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, deposits increased $709.1 million. The increase for the quarter and six month periods was primarily due to increases of $381.8 million and $760.7 million, respectively, in CD accounts to $6.3 billion and reflects the continued success of our marketing campaign that has focused on attracting long-term deposits to enable us to reduce high cost borrowings. During the second quarter of 2004, $1.1 billion of CDs, with a weighted average rate of 2.30% and an average maturity at inception of 14 months, matured and $1.4 billion of CDs were issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 2.69% and an average maturity at inception of 18 months. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, $2.2 billion of CDs, with a weighted average rate of 2.31% and an average maturity at inception of 14 months, matured and $2.9 billion of CDs were issued or repriced with a weighted average rate of 2.60% and an average maturity at inception of 20 months. "The CD marketing campaign, in addition to replacing borrowings with deposits, has also produced new customers from our communities, creating relationship development opportunities that, for example, during the second quarter, resulted in 26% of new customers and existing customers without checking accounts being cross-sold new, low-cost checking accounts, the linchpin for building long-term, profitable customer relationships. Importantly, our checking cross-sell penetration has increased to approximately 40% for the month of June," Mr. Engelke noted. Checking account deposits totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2004 and reflected annualized growth of 10% on a linked quarter basis. Additionally, our small business banking initiatives continue to result in solid growth of business deposits, including business savings and checking accounts. At June 30, 2004, business deposits totaled $268.3 million, increasing at an annualized rate of 24% on a linked quarter basis. Borrowings totaled $8.8 billion at June 30, 2004, a decrease of $591.0 million from the prior quarter end. Over the past nine months, in an effort to minimize interest rate risk, $3.3 billion of borrowings and $3.7 billion of CDs have been extended as shown in the following chart: Borrowings Weighted Weighted Refinanced Average Rate Average Orig.

Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 7.11%, 7.11% and 14.69%, respectively, at June 30, 2004. Second Quarter and Six Month Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 increased 18% to $113.3 million from $96.3 million for the 2003 second quarter and for the six months ended June 30, 2004 increased 11% to $227.8 million from $205.3 million for the comparable 2003 six-month period. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 was 2.13% compared to 2.14% on a linked quarter basis and 1.78% for the prior year quarter. The one basis point decline in the net interest margin on a linked quarter basis was primarily attributable to the effect of the $4.4 million increase in mortgage loan and MBS net premium amortization over the previous quarter, as previously discussed. Net premium amortization expense increased 53% to $12.7 million for the 2004 second quarter from $8.3 million in the prior quarter and declined $21.2 million, or 63%, from the year ago second quarter as detailed in the following chart: MBS and Mortgage Loan Net Premium Amortization Trends (Dollars in millions) Year Over Year Linked Quarter 2Q03 1Q04 2Q04 $Change %Change $Change %Change MBS $21.9 $2.9 $4.0 $(17.9) (82%) $1.1 38% Mortgage Loans $12.0 $5.4 $8.7 $(3.3) (28%) $3.3 61% Total $33.9 $8.3 $12.7 $(21.2) (63%) $4.4 53% Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2004 totaled $27.9 million compared to $31.5 million for the comparable 2003 quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2004 non-interest income decreased to $50.0 million from $57.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2003. The decreases are primarily due to the absence of net gain on sales of securities in the 2004 second quarter compared to $8.0 million in net gains on sales of securities in the 2003 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, net gain on sales of securities totaled $2.4 million compared to $10.2 million for the comparable 2003 period. Customer service fees for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004 totaled $14.6 million and $28.3 million, respectively, compared to $15.8 million and $30.6 million, respectively, for the comparable 2003 periods. The decreases are primarily due to lower fees from annuity sales and a decrease in debit card interchange fees caused by a reduction in the fee structure on signature-based debit card transactions. Mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, increased $6.7 million and $5.0 million in the respective three and six month periods ending June 30, 2004 as compared to the respective 2003 periods as detailed in the table below: (Dollars in millions) 2Q04 2Q03 1H04 1H03 Loan servicing fees $ 1.5 $ 2.1 $ 3.0 $4.4 Amortization of MSR* (1.8) (3.8) (3.8) (7.6) MSR valuation adjustments 5.2 (1.8) 3.8 (2.7) Net gain on sale of loans 1.4 3.1 2.1 6.0 Mortgage banking income, net $ 6.3 $(0.4) $5.1 $ 0.1 * Mortgage servicing rights General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004 totaled $55.4 million and $112.4 million, respectively, compared to $51.8 million and $103.8 million, respectively, for the comparable 2003 periods. The increase for the quarter is primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expense and for the six months is due to occupancy, equipment and systems expense, due to, among other things, systems enhancements over the past year as well as increased compensation and benefits expense. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2004, Mr. Engelke stated, "In the current environment of somewhat higher long-term interest rates, mortgage refinance activity has subsided and purchase mortgage activity, which represented approximately 70% of our residential loan applications in June, has remained strong. With the expectation of reduced cash flow from mortgage loan and MBS prepayments, we expect a resumption of mortgage loan portfolio growth going forward. Reduced mortgage refinance activity also results in lower mortgage loan and MBS net premium amortization which should result in a modest expansion in the net interest margin during the remainder of 2004. We will remain focused on building our core businesses, with particular emphasis on growing our deposits and increasing the 1-4 family, multifamily and CRE loan portfolios."

     On October 14, 2004, Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") reported that it upgraded the senior debt rating of Astoria Financial Corporation to Baa1 from Baa3. A copy of Moody's announcement is included herewith as an exhibit to this report.

Rating Action: Astoria Financial Corporation
MOODY'S UPGRADES ASTORIA FINANCIAL (SENIOR DEBT TO Baa1)
New York, October 14, 2004  Moody's Investors Service upgraded the senior debt rating of Astoria Financial Corporation to Baa1 from Baa3. At the same time, Moody's upgraded the ratings of Astoria's subsidiaries (long-term deposits at the thrift to A3 from Baa1; short-term deposits to Prime-1 from Prime-2). The thrift's financial strength rating was not affected. The ratings had been placed on review for possible upgrade on July 28, 2004. Following the upgrade, the rating outlook is stable.
According to Moody's, the upgrade is based on Astoria's demonstrated ability to continue to enhance its healthy low-cost core deposit franchise in Long Island, Brooklyn and Queens, New York, a particularly competitive market. Specifically, Astoria's long-time emphasis on service combined with targeted promotions has resulted in modest, but steady growth of checking and savings accounts, the thrift's two lowest-cost funding sources. However, these deposits still account for less than half of Astoria's total deposit base, as the thrift's funding base remains reliant on higher-cost CDs.
Moody's added that the upgrade is also based on its expectations that double leverage at Astoria's holding company will be reduced in the near-term. At year-end 2003, double leverage was 129%, well above the median for similarly-rated institutions.
Moody's notes that Astoria's sizable mortgage-backed securities portfolio makes it susceptible to changes in the interest rate environment. However, the upgrade incorporates Moody's belief that Astoria's ability to manage those changes is sound.
In raising the thrift's short-term rating to Prime-1 from Prime-2, the rating agency noted that Astoria's strong asset quality and comparative lack of concentration risk, combined with its healthy deposit base, fit the profile of other A3 banks and thrifts that are also rated Prime-1 for short-term obligations. This profile is characterized by the relative stability and predictability of those institutions fundamentals. In Moody's opinion, predictable fundamentals shelter these banks and thrifts from more significant credit transition risk, therefore justifying Prime-1 ratings compatible with A3 long-term ratings.
Following the upgrade, Moody's highlighted that any possible future positive rating action would require further meaningful expansion of Astoria's core deposit base. On the other hand, future negative rating action could result from a significant deterioration in either core profitability or asset quality, or from a material increase in double leverage.
The following ratings were upgraded:
Astoria Financial Corporation
 senior debt to Baa1 from Baa3
Astoria Federal Savings & Loan Association
 long-term deposits to A3 from Baa1
 issuer and OSO ratings to A3 from Baa2
 short-term deposits to Prime-1 from Prime-2
 the C bank financial strength rating is affirmed
Astoria Capital Trust
 preferred stock to Baa2 from Ba1
 
Astoria Financial Corporation, a thrift holding company headquartered in Lake Success, New York, reported $22.3 billion in assets at June 30, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Astoria Financial Corporation Announces 51% Increase in Third Quarter EPS TO $0.80 Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.25 Per Common Share Declared LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y, Oct. 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $58.1 million, or $0.80 diluted earnings per common share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, representing an increase of 40% and 51%, respectively, from net income of $41.6 million, or $0.53 diluted earnings per common share, for the 2003 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, net income totaled $169.0 million, or $2.28 diluted earnings per common share, up 14% and 23%, respectively, from $148.9 million, or $1.85 diluted earnings per common share for the comparable 2003 period. Net income and diluted earnings per common share for the quarter and nine month periods ended September 30, 2004 include an after-tax charge of $2.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted common share, pursuant to a previously announced arbitration award settlement in the third quarter. Third Quarter Financial Highlights: -- Diluted EPS: $0.80, up 51% from comparable period last year -- Net interest income: $121.9 million, up 53% from comparable period last year -- Net interest margin: 2.25%, up 73 basis points from comparable period last year -- Return on average assets: 1.02%, up 38% from comparable period last year -- Return on average equity: 16.82%, up 48% from comparable period last year -- Return on average tangible equity: 19.42%, up 49% from comparable period last year -- Total deposits increased $983.3 million to $12.2 billion, or 12% annualized from December 31, 2003 -- Total loans increased $117.2 million to $12.8 billion, or 1% annualized from December 31, 2003 -- Multifamily/Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") loan portfolio increased $334.4 million to $3.4 billion, or 14% annualized from December 31, 2003 and currently represents 27% of total loans -- Non-performing assets to total assets: 0.12%, an improvement of 20% from September 30, 2003 Commenting on the third quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "We are pleased to report another double-digit year-over-year increase in quarterly net income, earnings per share and returns on equity and tangible equity, due primarily to a 73 basis point increase in the net interest margin. Importantly, the combination of solid loan originations and lower mortgage refinance activity has resulted in a resumption of loan portfolio growth." Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 20, 2004 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per common share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2004 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2004. This is the thirty-eighth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Tenth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the third quarter, Astoria repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $35.61 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, Astoria repurchased 4.6 million shares at an average cost of $36.61 per share. The tenth repurchase program, which commenced during the third quarter and authorizes the repurchase of eight million shares, has approximately six million shares remaining. Moody's Upgrades Astoria Financial Corporation's Senior Debt On October 14, 2004, Moody's Investors Service announced that it upgraded the senior debt of Astoria Financial Corporation to Baa1 from Baa3. At the same time, the deposits of Astoria Federal were upgraded as follows: long- term deposits to A3 from Baa1 and short-term deposits to Prime-1 from Prime-2. According to Moody's, the upgrade is based on, among other things, Astoria's demonstrated ability to continue to enhance its healthy low-cost core deposit franchise in Long Island, Brooklyn and Queens, a particularly competitive market. Balance Sheet Summary Total assets increased to $22.8 billion at September 30, 2004 from $22.3 billion at June 30, 2004 and $22.5 billion at December 31, 2003. Total loans increased to $12.8 billion at September 30, 2004 from $12.6 billion at June 30, 2004 and $12.7 billion at December 31, 2003. Mortgage loan originations and purchases for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 totaled $1.0 billion compared to $2.3 billion for the 2003 third quarter, of which $635.3 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, were one-to-four family loans, predominately 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, mortgage loan originations and purchases totaled $3.1 billion compared to $5.8 billion for the comparable 2003 period of which $2.2 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, were one-to-four family loans. The decrease in mortgage loan volume was due to reduced mortgage loan refinance activity due to higher interest rates in 2004 as compared to 2003. Mortgage loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 totaled $691.1 million and $2.4 billion, respectively, compared to $1.5 billion and $4.3 billion for the respective 2003 periods. For the quarter ended September 30, 2004, multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $349.8 million compared to $556.6 million for the 2003 third quarter. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2004, multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $863.8 million compared to $1.2 billion for the 2003 nine month period. The multifamily and CRE loan portfolio grew $138.1 million, or 17% on an annualized basis, from June 30, 2004 and $334.4 million, or 14% on an annualized basis, from December 31, 2003, and totals $3.4 billion, or 27% of total loans, at September 30, 2004. The average loan-to-value ratio of the combined multifamily and CRE loan portfolios continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending capabilities are reflected in the growth of these portfolios since 1999: (Dollars in millions) 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 Multifamily/CRE Loans $1,014 $1,282 $1,693 $2,345 % of Total Loans 10% 11% 14% 20% Change (Dollars in millions) 12/31/03 9/30/04 12/31/99-9/30/04 Multifamily/CRE Loans $3,111 $3,445 +240% % of Total Loans 25% 27% +170% At September 30, 2004, non-performing loans totaled $27.0 million, or 0.12% of total assets compared to $33.3 million, or 0.15% of total assets, at September 30, 2003. Net charge-offs for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 totaled $15,000 and $318,000, respectively, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at September 30, 2004 was 307%. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") increased $318.5 million from the previous quarter and $278.7 million from December 31, 2003 and total $8.5 billion, or 37% of total assets, at September 30, 2004. Of the total, $2.3 billion, equal to 10% of total assets, are categorized as available-for-sale. The increase in MBS was primarily due to slower than expected cash flow. A detailed profile of the premium/discount associated with our fixed rate CMO/REMIC MBS portfolio at September 30, 2004 follows: (Dollars in Unamortized millions) Book Premium/ MBS Collateral Weighted Value (Discount) Coupon Coupon Avg Life Premium CMO/REMIC MBS $ 1,655 $ 14.7 4.96% 6.02% 2.4 yrs Discount/Par CMO/REMIC MBS $ 6,751 $ ( 25.8) 4.20% 5.76% 3.5 yrs Total $ 8,406 $ ( 11.1) 4.35% 5.81% 3.3 yrs Deposits increased $274.2 million, or 9% on an annualized basis, from June 30, 2004 and $983.3 million, or 12% annualized from December 31, 2003 to $12.2 billion at September 30, 2004. The increases for the quarter and nine months were primarily due to increases of $393.2 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, in CD accounts which total $6.7 billion at September 30, 2004. The growth reflects the continued success of a marketing campaign that has focused on attracting medium and long-term deposits. During the third quarter of 2004, $706.5 million of CDs with a weighted average rate of 1.88% and an average original term of 15 months matured and $1.0 billion of CDs were issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 2.67% for an average term of 19 months. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, $2.9 billion of CDs, with a weighted average rate of 2.21% and an average original term of 14 months matured and $3.9 billion of CDs were issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 2.62% for an average term of 20 months. "The CD marketing campaign, in addition to providing the funding to help manage interest rate risk, continues to produce new customers from our communities, creating relationship development opportunities," Mr. Engelke noted. Checking account deposits totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2004 for 2002 and increased $40.5 million, or 4% annualized from December 31, 2003. Additionally, our small business banking initiatives continue to result in solid growth of business deposits. Business deposits, including savings and checking accounts, totaled $281.3 million at September 30, 2004 and increased $44.2 million, or 25% annualized from December 31, 2003. Borrowings totaled $8.9 billion at September 30, 2004, or 39% of total assets, an increase of $116.2 million from the previous quarter and a decrease of $712.1 million from December 31, 2003. Stockholders' equity was $1.4 billion, or 6.09% of total assets at September 30, 2004. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.85%, 6.85% and 14.16%, respectively, at September 30, 2004. Third Quarter and Nine Month Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 increased 53% to $121.9 million from $79.6 million for the 2003 third quarter and for the nine months ended September 30, 2004 increased 23% to $349.7 million from $284.9 million for the comparable 2003 nine-month period. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 was 2.25% compared to 2.13% on a linked quarter basis and 1.52% for the prior year quarter. The linked quarter and year over year increases in the net interest margin are primarily attributable to lower premium amortization expense. Net premium amortization expense decreased 55% to $5.7 million for the 2004 third quarter from $12.7 million in the prior quarter and declined $29.0 million, or 84%, from the year ago third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2004, net premium amortization expense declined 71%, or $66.9 million, to $26.7 million from $93.6 million for the comparable 2003 nine month period. Details are highlighted in the following chart: MBS and Mortgage Loan Net Premium Amortization Trends (Dollars in Year Over Year Linked Quarter millions) 3Q03 2Q04 3Q04 $ Change % Change $ Change % Change MBS $22.6 $4.0 $0.9 $(21.7) (96%) $(3.1) (78%) Mortgage Loans $12.1 $8.7 $4.8 $( 7.3) (60%) $(3.9) (45%) Total $34.7 $12.7 $5.7 $(29.0) (84%) $(7.0) (55%) Nine Months Ended September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2003 2004 MBS $58.2 $7.8 Mortgage Loans $35.4 $18.9 Total $93.6 $26.7 Non-interest income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 totaled $24.0 million and $74.0 million, respectively, compared to $33.9 million and $91.3 million, respectively, for the comparable 2003 periods. The decreases for the three and nine month periods were primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, net, and lower net gain on sales of securities. Net gain on sales of securities for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 totaled $2.3 million and $4.7 million, respectively, compared to $4.5 million and $14.7 million, respectively, for the comparable 2003 periods. Customer service fees for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 totaled $15.3 million and $43.6 million, respectively, compared to $15.1 million and $45.7 million, respectively, for the comparable 2003 periods. Mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income decreased as compared to the respective 2003 periods as detailed in the table below: (Dollars in millions) 3Q04 3Q03 9Mos04 9Mos03 Loan servicing fees $ 1.4 $ 1.8 $ 4.4 $6.2 Amortization of MSR* (1.4) (3.0) (5.2) (10.6) MSR valuation adjustments (1.9) 2.9 1.9 0.2 Net gain on sale of loans 0.7 4.3 2.8 10.2 Mortgage banking (loss) income, net $ (1.2) $ 6.0 $3.9 $6.0 *Mortgage servicing rights General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004 totaled $59.2 million and $171.6 million, respectively, compared to $51.4 million and $155.2 million, respectively, for the comparable 2003 periods. The increases for the 2004 third quarter and nine month period are primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expense, increased occupancy, equipment and systems expense, due to, among other things, systems enhancements over the past year and a previously announced third quarter $3.2 million, pre-tax, arbitration award settlement. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2004, Mr. Engelke stated, "In the current environment of low long-term interest rates, purchase mortgage activity continues to remain strong and represented 61% of our third quarter residential mortgage loan applications. With continued mortgage loan origination activity, we should experience good core business balance sheet and net interest income growth. The continued flattening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, however, will temper near-term margin expansion. We will remain focused on building our core businesses, with particular emphasis on growing our deposits and increasing the 1-4 family, multifamily and CRE loan portfolios."

Exhibit 10.1
[Astoria Financial Corporation Letterhead]
November 17, 2004
Mr. Lawrence W. Peters 194 Captains Way West Bay Shore, New York 11706
Dear Mr. Peters:
The purpose of this letter is to set forth the agreement that has been reached concerning the retirement benefits to which you are entitled under the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and Astoria Financial Corporation Directors' Retirement Plan, as amended (the "Astoria Plan") and the Long Island Bancorp, Inc. Non-Employee Directors Retirement Benefit Plan (the "LIB Plan").
Astoria Financial Corporation ("Astoria Financial") will pay you a monthly benefit equal to Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000.00), commencing on or about December 1, 2004 and continuing monthly thereafter until a total of 120 monthly payments have been made. In the event of your death before all 120 payments have been made, Astoria Financial will make any remaining monthly payments to your designated beneficiary (or, if there is no beneficiary, to your estate). If your designated beneficiary survives you but dies before all remaining payments due hereunder have been made, Astoria Financial will make any remaining monthly payments to your designated beneficiary's beneficiary (or, if there is no beneficiary, to his or her estate) and then to his or her designated beneficiary (or, if there is no beneficiary, to his or her estate), and so forth, until all 120 payments have been made.
You may designate a beneficiary to receive amounts that remain payable under this letter as of the date of your death by written notice signed by you and actually received by Astoria Financial prior to your death. You may change or revoke any designation so made by means of a similar signed instrument. Any determination made by Astoria Financial as to the validity of any beneficiary designation you make under this letter and as to whether any beneficiary so named has survived you shall be conclusive and binding on all parties in the absence of manifest error.
The payments made hereunder are in respect of your service as a non-employee director and will not be subject to income tax withholding.

Exhibit 99.1 ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION TO RECORD OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IN FOURTH QUARTER RELATING TO FREDDIE MAC PREFERRED STOCK LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 14 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation ("Company") (NYSE: AF), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, announced today that it intends to record an other-than-temporary impairment non-cash after-tax charge of $9.6 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2004 related to $120 million face value of perpetual preferred stock issued by Freddie Mac, a government sponsored entity. The perpetual preferred stock issues are investment grade securities (AA- by S&P, Aa3 by Moody's) that are held in the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio. Prior to this charge, impairment was recorded as an unrealized mark-to-market loss on securities available-for-sale and reflected as a reduction to equity through other comprehensive income. Accordingly, the reclassification of the unrealized after-tax loss to an other-than-temporary impairment non-cash charge will not affect shareholders' equity or related capital ratios. George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO of Astoria commented, "The decision to reclassify the unrealized mark-to-market loss on these securities to an other-than-temporary impairment charge is based on a very conservative interpretation of accounting literature and does not reflect the expected long-term value of these investment grade securities." Astoria Financial Corporation, as previously announced, expects to report fourth quarter and full year financial results on Thursday morning, January 20, 2005. Fourth quarter 2004 diluted earnings per share, absent this charge, are expected to be within a range of between $0.83 - $0.85. Including this charge, under generally accepted accounting principles, fourth quarter diluted earnings per share are expected to be within a range of between $0.69 - $0.71. Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $22.8 billion is the fifth largest thrift institution in the United States. Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $12.2 billion and embraces its philosophy of Putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, http://www.astoriafederal.com.

Commenting on the fourth quarter and full year results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "The quarter and full year operating results announced today were marked by double-digit growth in operating earnings, operating earnings per share and related returns and were favorably impacted by strong deposit and loan growth." Board Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend 20%; Declares 3-for-2 Stock Split The Company also announced that the Board of Directors, at their January 19, 2005 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share, an increase of 20%, and declared a three-for-two stock split in the form of a 50% stock dividend. The cash dividend, representing the thirty-ninth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared, will be paid on the total number of shares held before the stock split. Shareholders will receive three shares of Astoria Financial Corporation common stock for every two shares owned as of the close of business on the record date. The new shares will be distributed and the cash dividend is payable on March 1, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 15, 2005. As a result of the stock split, the number of common shares outstanding will increase to approximately 110 million. Commenting on the Board's action, Mr. Engelke said, "The increase in the cash dividend is an indication of the Board's continued confidence in the fundamental strength of the Company and its future prospects. The stock split should also benefit shareholders by increasing liquidity and enhancing the marketability of our common stock." Tenth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the 2004 fourth quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $39.12 per share. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 6.0 million shares were repurchased at an average cost of $37.23 per share. The tenth repurchase program, which commenced during the 2004 third quarter and authorizes the repurchase of eight million shares, has approximately 4.6 million shares remaining. Board Sets Annual Shareholders' Meeting Date The Board of Directors, at their January 19, 2005 meeting, established May 18, 2005 as the date for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a voting record date of March 25, 2005. Balance Sheet Summary Total assets increased to $23.4 billion at December 31, 2004 from $22.8 billion at September 30, 2004 and $22.5 billion at December 31, 2003, primarily due to strong loan growth. For the quarter ended December 31, 2004, total loans increased $459.1 million, or 14% annualized, to $13.3 billion at December 31, 2004. Total loan originations and purchases were $1.2 billion for the 2004 fourth quarter compared to $1.5 billion for the 2003 fourth quarter. The volume decrease was the result of reduced mortgage loan refinance activity due to higher interest rates in 2004 as compared to 2003. Mortgage loan prepayments for the 2004 fourth quarter totaled $618.1 million compared to $894.1 million during the 2003 fourth quarter.
During the 2004 fourth quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $368.9 million, or 17% annualized, to $9.1 billion at December 31, 2004. Loan originations and purchases totaled $1.0 billion for both the 2004 and 2003 fourth quarters, of which over 70% each year consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage loans. 1-4 family loan prepayments for the 2004 fourth quarter totaled $503.7 million compared to $656.7 million in the year ago fourth quarter. Commenting on the 1-4 family loan growth, Mr. Engelke noted, "As anticipated, reduced prepayment activity and continued strong loan origination volume has enabled us to turn the corner with respect to increasing the 1-4 family loan portfolio. We expect the strong growth of this portfolio to continue in 2005." During the 2004 fourth quarter, the multifamily/CRE mortgage loan portfolio increased $58.7 million to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2004. Originations totaled $190.5 million for the 2004 fourth quarter compared to $444.9 million for the 2003 fourth quarter. The volume of multifamily/CRE originations declined in the 2004 fourth quarter as we maintained our pricing discipline in this very competitive market. Prepayments for the 2004 fourth quarter totaled $114.4 million compared to $237.4 million in the year ago fourth quarter. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, total loans increased $576.3 million and loan originations and purchases totaled $4.3 billion compared to $7.3 billion for the comparable 2003 period. The decrease in mortgage loan volume was due to reduced mortgage loan refinance activity due to higher interest rates in 2004 as compared to 2003. Mortgage loan prepayments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 totaled $3.0 billion compared to $5.2 billion for the comparable 2003 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 1-4 family loans increased $83.7 million compared to a $238.3 million decrease in the portfolio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Originations and purchases of 1-4 family loans for 2004 totaled $3.2 billion compared to $5.6 billion for the comparable 2003 period. 1-4 family mortgage loan prepayments for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 totaled $2.4 billion compared to $4.4 billion for the comparable 2003 period. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, multifamily and CRE loans increased $393.1 million, or 13%, to $3.5 billion. Originations decreased $595.7 million to $1.1 billion compared to $1.7 billion for the 2003 twelve month period. Prepayments for the full year totaled $603.4 million compared to $832.0 million for 2003. The average loan-to-value ratio of the combined multifamily and CRE loan portfolios continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. The Company's strong multifamily and CRE lending capabilities are reflected in the growth of these portfolios since 1999:
At December 31, 2004, non-performing loans totaled $32.6 million, or 0.14% of total assets compared to $29.7 million, or 0.13% of total assets, at December 31, 2003. Net charge-offs for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 totaled just $45,000 and $363,000, respectively, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at December 31, 2004 was 254%. Mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") totaled $8.5 billion, or 36% of total assets, at December 31, 2004, unchanged from the previous quarter and up $298.0 million from year-end 2003. Of the total at year-end 2004, $2.3 billion, equal to 10% of total assets, are categorized as available-for-sale. During the 2004 fourth quarter, deposits increased $153.4 million to $12.3 billion at December 31, 2004, primarily due to an increase in certificate of deposit ("CD") accounts. During the 2004 fourth quarter, $960.0 million of CDs with a weighted average rate of 3.17% and an average original term of 23 months matured and $1.1 billion of CDs were issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 2.82% for an average term of 19 months. Checking accounts grew at an annualized rate of 12% in the 2004 fourth quarter to $1.6 billion from $1.5 billion at the end of the 2004 third quarter. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, deposits increased $1.1 billion, or 10%, primarily due to an increase in CD accounts. During the twelve month period, $3.9 billion of CDs, with a weighted average rate of 2.45% and an average original term of 16 months matured and $5.0 billion of CDs were issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 2.66% for an average original term of 20 months. Our small business banking initiatives continue to produce solid growth in business deposits. These deposits, including savings, checking and money market accounts, totaled $277.3 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of $40.2 million, or 17%, from December 31, 2003. According to Mr. Engelke, "The strong growth in deposits reflects the continued success of a marketing campaign focusing on medium and long-term deposits that, in addition to contributing to the management of interest rate risk, continues to produce new customers from our communities, creating relationship development opportunities. For example, of the new customers and existing customers without checking accounts who opened the promotional CD accounts, approximately 23% also opened low-cost checking accounts, the linchpin for building long-term profitable customer relationships." Borrowings at December 31, 2004 totaled $9.5 billion, an increase of $549.9 million from the previous quarter-end and a decrease of $162.2 million from December 31, 2003. The increase in borrowings in the 2004 fourth quarter primarily funded mortgage loan growth that exceeded deposit growth and provided temporary liquidity to fund a dividend payment to Astoria from Astoria Federal. It is anticipated that borrowings will be reduced during the 2005 first quarter by anticipated deposit inflows and securities cash flow.
Stockholders' equity was $1.4 billion, or 5.85% of total assets at December 31, 2004. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 5.99%, 5.99% and 12.44%, respectively, at December 31, 2004. Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 increased 28% to $120.9 million from $94.6 million for the 2003 fourth quarter and, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, increased 24% to $470.6 million from $379.5 million for the comparable 2003 twelve month period. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 was 2.18% compared to 2.25% on a linked quarter basis and 1.74% for the prior year fourth quarter. The 7 basis point linked quarter decrease was attributable to a slightly higher cost of funds and a slightly lower yield on earning assets due to, among other things, the flattening of the yield curve. The 44 basis point fourth quarter year over year increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower premium amortization expense. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the net interest margin increased 39 basis points to 2.17% from 1.78% for the full year 2003. The increase is primarily due to a 72% decline in net premium amortization expense, or $81.0 million, to $32.0 million for 2004 from $113.0 million for 2003. Details are highlighted in the following chart: MBS and Mortgage Loan Net Premium Amortization Trends Twelve Months Ended December 31, (Dollars in millions) 2003 2004 $ Change % Change - ---------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- MBS $ 70.9 $ 8.1 $ (62.8) (89)% Mortgage Loans $ 42.1 $ 23.9 $ (18.2) (43)% Total $ 113.0 $ 32.0 $ (81.0) (72)% Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2004 totaled $22.6 million, excluding the previously announced other-than-temporary impairment non-cash pre-tax charge of $16.5 million, compared to $28.2 million for the comparable 2003 period. For the year ended December 31, 2004, non-interest income totaled $96.6 million, excluding the previously announced other-than-temporary impairment non-cash pre-tax charge of $16.5 million, compared to $119.6 million for 2003. The decreases for the fourth quarter and full year were primarily due to lower other income and lower mortgage banking income, net, which is further described below. In the 2003 fourth quarter, other income included a $10.1 million gain on the sale of a joint venture. No net gain on sales of securities was recorded in the 2004 fourth quarter compared to a net loss of $7.3 million recorded in the 2003 fourth quarter. For the full year 2004 net gain on sales of securities totaled $4.7 million compared to $7.3 million in 2003.
Mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, decreased during the 2004 fourth quarter and full year as compared to the respective 2003 periods as detailed in the table below: (Dollars in millions) 4Q04 4Q03 2004 2003 - ---------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Loan servicing fees $ 1.4 $ 1.7 $ 5.8 $ 7.9 Amortization of MSR* (1.6) (2.2) (6.8) (12.8) MSR valuation adjustments 0.3 2.9 2.2 3.1 Net gain on sale of loans 0.7 1.9 3.5 12.1 Mortgage banking income, net $ 0.8 $ 4.3 $ 4.7 $ 10.3 *Mortgage servicing rights General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2004 totaled $53.4 million and $225.0 million, respectively, compared to $50.7 million and $205.9 million in the comparable 2003 periods. The increases are due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expense; occupancy, equipment and systems expense, due to, among other things, systems enhancements over the past year; a $3.2 million arbitration award settlement in the 2004 third quarter; and increased goodwill litigation expense incurred in connection with the commencement of a goodwill lawsuit trial this week. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2005, Mr. Engelke stated, "The slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which has flattened considerably in 2004 and is projected to continue to flatten during 2005, presents a challenge. Nevertheless, we should continue to experience solid core business growth. Deposit growth is expected to remain robust as we launch several new deposit products, specifically a short-term Liquid CD account and a new business money market account, to augment our very successful efforts in attracting medium term CD accounts. We will also continue to focus on building our checking account deposit base, which we view as the linchpin to building long-term, profitable customer relationships. With respect to mortgage lending, particularly 1-4 family lending, we are encouraged by the strength of the purchase mortgage market and the reduced level of loan prepayments, which should result in continued strong 1-4 family loan portfolio growth in 2005. We also anticipate solid growth in the multifamily/CRE loan portfolios in 2005. Notwithstanding core business growth, based on the projected further flattening of the yield curve, we expect to limit asset growth by reducing the securities and borrowing portfolios by approximately $1 billion each through normal cash flow in 2005. At the same time, we will continue to repurchase our stock, as we continue to view this activity as a very desirable use of capital." Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $23.4 billion is the fifth largest thrift institution in the United States. Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $12.3 billion and embraces its philosophy of Putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, http://www.astoriafederal.com.

Exhibit 4.1 AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS, PREFERENCES AND RIGHTS OF SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK of ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION Pursuant to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ---------- We, George L. Engelke, Jr. and Alan P. Eggleston, being the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, respectively, of Astoria Financial Corporation, a corporation organized and existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation"), in accordance with the provisions of Sections 103 and 151 thereof, DO HEREBY CERTIFY: That, pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors of the Corporation at a meeting duly called and held on July 17, 1996, at which a quorum was present and acting throughout, by resolution duly created a series of 325,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, designated "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock." Pursuant to such authority, the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 22, 1996. That, pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors of the Corporation at a meeting duly called and held on October 17, 2001, at which a quorum was present and acting throughout, by resolution duly increased the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from 325,000 shares to 1,225,000 shares. Pursuant to such authority, an Amended Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on November 1, 2001. That, pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors of the Corporation at a meeting duly called and held on January 19, 2005, at which a quorum was present and acting throughout, duly approved and adopted the following resolution increasing the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from 1,225,000 to 1,800,000 shares: RESOLVED, that the number of shares constituting the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), of the Company be, and it hereby is, increased from 1,225,000 to 1,800,000 shares; That, pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of Directors by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board of Directors of the Corporation at a meeting duly called and held on January 19, 2005, at which a quorum was present and acting throughout, by resolution duly adopted and approved this Amended and Restated Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock to reflect the foregoing:
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock: Section 1. Designation and Amount. The shares of such series shall be designated as "Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock," par value $1.00 per share, and the number of shares constituting such series shall be 1,800,000. Such number of shares may be increased or decreased by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors"); provided, that no decrease shall reduce the number of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares then outstanding plus the number of shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options, rights or warrants or upon the conversion of any outstanding securities issued by the Corporation convertible into Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. Section 2. Dividends and Distributions. (a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of any series of preferred stock (or any similar stock) ranking prior and superior to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in preference to the holders of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Corporation, and of any other junior stock, shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the first day of March, June, September and December in each year (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $1 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash dividends or other distributions, other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the last issuance of any share or fraction of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise, than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(b) The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1 per share on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. (c) Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. Dividends paid on the shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof. Section 3. Voting Rights. The holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights: (a) Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation shall at any time declare or pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.
(b) Except as otherwise provided herein, in any other resolution creating a series of preferred stock or any similar stock, in any amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation or by law, the holders of shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock and any other capital stock of the Corporation having general voting rights shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation. Except as set forth herein, or as otherwise provided by law, holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action. Section 4. Certain Restrictions. (a) Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions payable on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not: (i) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; (ii) declare or pay dividends, or make any other distributions, on any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such shares are then entitled; (iii) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration shares of any stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, provided that the Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in exchange for shares of any stock of the Corporation ranking junior,(either as to dividends or upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock; or (iv) redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a parity with the Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes, shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment among the respective series or classes.
(b) The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (a) of this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner. Section 5. Reacquired Shares. Any shares of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and canceled promptly after the acquisition thereof.

Section 7. Consolidation, Merger, etc. In case the Corporation shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case each share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.

Section 11. Fractional Shares. Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock may be issued in fractions of a share, which shall entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' STATEMENT ON BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS Astoria Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, have always followed the highest principles of business ethics in their dealings with Employees, customers, other persons with whom we do business and the general public. That is the reputation we now enjoy. It is the reputation we intend to keep. To maintain this standard, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board of Directors has adopted this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics formalizes the principles by which we have conducted business for many years. It is addressed to all Directors, Officers and Employees of Astoria Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. All such persons must certify that they have read this statement, understand our policies and their responsibilities concerning business conduct and are expected to conform to the requirements of this Code. Difficulties can generally be minimized or avoided entirely if individuals seek the assistance of the Director of Human Resources at the outset of a problem or concern. No Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can replace the "thoughtful behavior of an ethical director, officer or employee."/1/ It can, however, focus our attention on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to our personnel, provide a mechanism to report unethical behavior and further our culture of honesty and integrity. By reading this policy carefully and understanding and following its directives, we are confident that Astoria can maintain its valued reputation for the highest standards of business ethics. As used throughout this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the term "Astoria" refers to Astoria Financial Corporation and all of its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and its subsidiaries. /S/ George L. Engelke, Jr. ------------------------------------ George L. Engelke, Jr. Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer /S/ Ralph F. Palleschi ------------------------------------ Ralph F. Palleschi Presiding Director and Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors - ---------- /1/ Commentary to New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, Corporate Governance Standards, Section 303A, Number 10. 1
CODE OF BUSINESS CONDUCT AND ETHICS I. General Statement Astoria Financial Corporation's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") can be summarized as follows: Directors, Officers and Employees are all expected to act with the utmost integrity. No Director, Officer, or Employee is to personally gain, either directly or indirectly, from the initiation of any transaction involving Astoria Financial Corporation ("Astoria"). All Directors, Officers and Employees are expected to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest. All Directors, Officers and Employees owe Astoria a duty of loyalty. This means that the well being of Astoria, and not the personal gain of the individual Director, Officer or Employee, must be utmost in our minds in connection with all business transactions. We will treat others, whether they be customers, shareholders, other Directors, Officers or Employees, or members of the public in a professional, businesslike manner, with respect and courtesy. Our Directors, Officers and Employees shall deal fairly with our customers, suppliers, competitors and each other. No Director, Officer or Employee shall take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged, confidential or proprietary information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice. Maintaining our high level of ethics and integrity dictates that we do not accept customers or suppliers who are themselves unethical. If we have doubts about the standards of an individual, we will decline to do business with that individual rather than risk damage to our reputation. Astoria's business is to be conducted in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and the policies contained in this Code. It is the affirmative obligation of each Director, Officer and Employee to report any suspected violations of this Code to the Director of Human Resources, unless otherwise specified in this Code. No retaliatory action will be taken against any Director, Officer or Employee as a result of their good faith reporting of suspected violations of this Code, unless they themselves have violated this Code II. Definitions A. Affiliated Persons. Affiliated Persons of Astoria are persons who have a special relationship with Astoria because of their status as or relationships with Directors or Officers. Specifically, the wife or husband of an Astoria Director or Officer is an Affiliated Person of Astoria. In addition, members of a Director's or Officer's immediate family are Affiliated Persons of Astoria if they share the same home as that individual. Aside from individuals, the definition of an Affiliated Person also extends to entities such as corporations, organizations, trusts and estates if the Director or Officer or an Affiliated Person is also an officer, director, general or limited partner, principal shareholder or other controlling person of one or more of such entities. 2
The definition of who is an Affiliated Person can be complex. Any questions should be referred to the Director of Human Resources. B. Director. The term "Director" means any member of the Board of Directors of Astoria whether or not receiving compensation. An Advisory Board member is not considered a Director solely as a result of service as an Advisory Board member. C. Employee. The term "Employee" means anyone employed in any capacity by Astoria. D. Officer. The term "Officer" means any officer of Astoria, including but not limited to the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Administrative Officer, Executive Vice Presidents, Senior Vice Presidents, First Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents, First Assistant Vice Presidents, Assistant Vice Presidents, Assistant Treasurers and Assistant Secretaries. The term Executive Officers refers to the President and Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice Presidents and the Chief Administrative Officer. E. Related Interest. A Related Interest is: (i) a company that is controlled by a Director or Officer, or (ii) a political or campaign committee controlled by a Director or Officer the funds or services of which will benefit the Director or Officer. III. Particular Guidelines A. Receiving Compensation. A Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person should not accept things of value, directly or indirectly, for himself or herself or for any other person from any customer, service provider, agent or person relating to or emanating from his or her employment with or performance of service or other duties for Astoria. Astoria compensates its Directors, Officers and Employees for the services they provide to Astoria and its customers. Authorized compensation includes salary, wages, bonuses, incentive compensation, commissions and other monetary payments approved by Astoria's Board of Directors, as well as medical and dental benefits, life insurance, pension benefits, paid vacation days, personal and sick day leave, severance pay and other employee benefits. 3
A Director, Officer or Employee must never accept compensation directly or indirectly in any form from any source or person other than Astoria for directing Astoria's business to such person or for accepting business on behalf of Astoria. All placements of Astoria's business and acceptance of business by Astoria must be awarded or accepted purely on business considerations based upon what is in the best interests of Astoria and its shareholders. B. Receiving Loan Procurement Fees. The Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") prohibits Directors, Officers, and other persons having the power to control the management or policies of Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association from receiving, either directly or indirectly, fees, commissions or compensation of any kind in connection with the procurement of loans for Astoria. C. Compensating Others. Directors, Officers or Employees must never make undisclosed or secret payments to any person or entity with the intent to influence the seeking or retaining of business for Astoria. No secret or illegal payments, whether in the form of kickbacks, bribes or other payments, shall be made to obtain a benefit for Astoria or any Director, Officer or Employee. See the section entitled "Compliance With Other Laws " below. D. Business Decisions. No Director, Officer or Employee shall permit a decision about whether Astoria will do business with a customer, prospect or supplier to be influenced by any unrelated interest. Decisions about Astoria's placement of business with customers, prospects and suppliers, and the volume of such business must be based solely upon business considerations. E. Accepting and Giving Gifts. A Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person shall not solicit or demand for the benefit of any person, or accept or agree to accept, anything of value from any person other than Astoria, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business or transaction of Astoria. 4
A Director, Officer or Employee must not accept any cash or cash equivalents, tangible gifts having an excessive value under the circumstances, favors, preferential treatment or excessive entertainment from current or prospective customers or suppliers of Astoria or any gift if it is intended to influence the actions of such Director, Officer or Employee. Similarly, any cash or cash equivalents, excessive tangible gifts, favors, preferential treatment or excessive entertainment may not be given to customers or suppliers, nor should any gift be given if it is intended to actually influence such customers or suppliers. Business meals and entertainment may be accepted or paid for if a legitimate business purpose is served and the cost is reasonable under the circumstances. It is expected that Directors, Officers and Employees will exercise prudent judgement in their patterns of business entertainment. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may establish guidelines to assist Directors, Officers or Employees in determining what is considered excessive or preferential. See the Section entitled "Compliance with Other Laws" for further information regarding giving or receiving gifts. Receipt by a Director, Officer or Employee of an inheritance from a customer based solely on Astoria's business relationship with that customer is strictly prohibited. See the section below entitled "Bequests." F. Personal Finances. Due to the nature of our business, Astoria insists on integrity in personal finances. It is extremely important that each Director, Officer and Employee maintain a sound personal financial condition. Failure to do so can only create a distraction and may lead to compromise of this Code. Personal finances, if handled improperly, can undermine impartiality, credibility and judgement. G. Personal Investments and Insider Trading. Directors and many Officers and Employees are exposed to confidential "inside" information regarding Astoria; that is, information which has not been made public. No person, including a Director, Officer or Employee, may purchase or sell any Astoria stock at a time when that person is aware of "material inside information" regarding Astoria. Nor may a Director, Officer or Employee pass along such information to influence the investments of someone else. Any person using such information for personal benefit or disclosing it to others outside Astoria may be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as significant personal liability. 5
Also, material non-public information concerning publicly-traded corporations other than Astoria, obtained as a result of a Director's, Officer's or Employee's service to or employment by Astoria, may not be used in connection with the purchase or sale of securities of that other company, until such information is publicly disclosed in a proper fashion by that company or its authorized representatives. Directors, Officers and Employees of Astoria are expected to fully comply with all requirements of law relating to the disclosure of inside or confidential information relating to Astoria or its customers and suppliers and to fully comply with all legal requirements relating to trading in Astoria's stock or that of other public companies with whom Astoria does business. Astoria's Board of Directors has separately adopted the Corporate Policy Statement Regarding Disclosure and Confidentiality, the Policy Regarding Transactions in Astoria Financial Corporation Securities by Directors, Officers and Employees, and the Policy Concerning Trading in Options in Astoria Financial Corporation Common Stock. These policies are intended to assist Directors, Officers and Employees in meeting these compliance obligations. Any Director, Officer or Employee requiring additional guidance concerning such policies or whether information he or she possesses may be considered material inside information should contact Astoria's Director of Human Resources. H. Conflicts of Interest and Disclosure. Conflicts of interest and the appearance of such conflicts can adversely effect Astoria's reputation for integrity and its profitability. Such conflicts can undermine public confidence in Astoria and other institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). A conflict of interest occurs when: i. a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person puts his or her own interests or the interests of some other person or entity ahead of Astoria's interests. ii. the interests of a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person are in opposition to the interests of Astoria. iii. something of value would or could have been received by Astoria, but for the actions or inactions of a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person, whether or not the thing of value was received by the Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person or any other individual or entity other than Astoria. 6
iv. a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person has information which would or could materially affect a decision of Astoria and the Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person does not disclose such information to Astoria. All Directors, Officers and Employees are expected to recognize and avoid conflicts of interest. Directors, Officers and Employees may not represent Astoria in any transaction if their personal interest might influence, or give the appearance of influencing, their ability to represent Astoria's interests impartially and to the best of their abilities. Thus, for example and not by way of limitation, Directors, Officers and Employees are prohibited from processing any transaction to or involving any account at Astoria in which the Director, Officer or Employee or an Affiliated Person of such Director, Officer or Employee has any interest. There must be no secret agreements, or side arrangements between Astoria, a Director, Officer or Employee, customers or suppliers of Astoria, or other third parties. No Director, Officer or Employee should be subject to influences, interests or relationships that conflict with the best interests of Astoria, during the course of their service to Astoria. No personal investments are to be made in the business or projects of borrowers or suppliers other than ownership of debt or equity securities of publicly-traded companies purchased in the open market. Any such personal investment must be disclosed in writing to the Director of Human Resources of Astoria and in no event shall exceed 5.0% of the class of outstanding securities of such borrowers or suppliers. No Officer or Employee having lending authority shall have any financial interest in a borrower with whom the Officer or Employee conducts Astoria business. A Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person has a duty to disclose any personal business relationship they have with any customers of Astoria or any other persons Astoria deals with in the course of its business. Directors, Officers, Employee or Affiliated Persons must not borrow from suppliers, agents or customers of, or applicants for credit from, the Association, unless such suppliers, agents, customers or applicants for credit are in the business of lending money and any such loan is made on terms and conditions available to the general public and not on special or advantageous terms. For purposes of this Section H of the Code, the term "Director", "Officer" or "Employee" in addition to the definitions set forth above, shall include (i) a Director's, Officer's, or Employee's immediate family whether by full or half blood or by adoption or (ii) any person or entity acting as an agent or fiduciary for any immediate family member, through which a Director, Officer or Employee may receive a direct or indirect personal benefit. 7
Each Director, Officer and Employee must use an Employee Acknowledgment and Disclosure Form to disclose annually any situations which may present a conflict between their personal or financial interests and those of Astoria. This form must be returned directly to the attention of the Director of Human Resources. Whenever a Director's, Officer's or Employee's circumstances change and it appears that a conflict has or may arise with respect to the requirements set forth in this Code, the Director, Officer or Employee shall complete and file a new Employee Acknowledgment and Disclosure Form with the Director of Human Resources. Questions as to whether an activity constitutes a breech of Astoria's Code should be directed to the Director of Human Resources. I. Bequests. Receipt of inheritances by a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person from a customer based upon that customer's business relationship with Astoria are strictly prohibited. Any bequests involving a customer must be based upon a relationship other than the customer's business relationship with Astoria. Any such bequest from a customer of Astoria, which is not from an immediate family member of the Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person, shall be reported to the Director of Human Resources before the bequest is accepted by the Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person so that a determination can be made as to whether the bequest is allowable under this policy. J. Outside Affiliations or Employment. No Director, Officer or Employee may serve as a director, officer or employee of another institution in direct competition with Astoria. All Officers and Employees must notify their immediate supervisor and the Director of Human Resources before agreeing to serve as a director, trustee, officer, controlling shareholder or partner or employee of any other business, trade group or other organization, or be elected or appointed to a political office regardless of whether compensation for services is received. Directors shall report such matters to the Chief Executive Officer. Such notification shall contain an estimate of the time which such service will require and a statement as to any potential conflicts of interest. Community involvement by Directors, Officers and Employees of Astoria is encouraged, and no Director, Officer or Employee will be prohibited from serving as a director, trustee, officer, or representative of a non-profit organization, as a volunteer and without compensation, if there is no conflict of interest presented and such service does not interfere with the Director's, Officer's or Employee's service or employment with Astoria. 8
Officers and Employees may not hold outside employment or carry on outside business activities that interfere with the performance of their responsibilities to Astoria. Actions that violate this prohibition include, but are not limited to (i) working at another job during the hours an Officer or Employee is expected to be working for Astoria, (ii) using Astoria's equipment, facilities or supplies for another job or activity, or (iii) working for another company that competes with or does business with Astoria. Outside employment meeting these criteria and any outside activity that may give the appearance of any impropriety must be disclosed on the Employee Acknowledgment and Disclosure Form. K. Confidential and Proprietary information. Directors, Officers and Employee must at all times maintain the trust placed in them by Astoria, our shareholders and customers by not disclosing confidential and proprietary information and data regarding the business of Astoria, its customers or suppliers. All proprietary and customer information should be treated as confidential and should only be disclosed by us through the appropriate Officers, if authorized, or if we are compelled to do so by law. Confidential information includes but is not limited to all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to Astoria or its customers, if disclosed. Proprietary information includes, but is not limited to, products and services, methods, systems, reports, analyses, financial data, business plans, marketing, methods and strategies, trade secrets and customer data and lists. L. Loans to Directors, Officers and Employees. Astoria Financial Corporation does not make loans to Directors, Officers, Employees or Affiliated Persons. Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association is authorized to make home mortgage and consumer loans to Directors, Officers and Employees, subject to Astoria's Employee and Director Mortgage and Home Equity Loan Policy and the Employee and Director Loan Section of Astoria's Consumer Lending and Collection Policy (the "Employee Policies") and applicable OTS and Federal Reserve Board regulations. The proceeds of those loans must be applied to those purposes described and approved in the loan application. i. Types of Loans and Extensions of Credit. Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association is empowered to make home mortgage and consumer loans to its Directors, Officers and Employees. ii. Terms and Conditions of Loans and Extensions of Credit. Loans made by Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association to Directors, Officers and their Related Interests will be made in accordance with the Employee Policies. Preferential loans or extensions of credit not in accordance with the Employee Policies, to Directors, Officers or their Related Interests are strictly prohibited. 9
iii. Approval of Loans and Extensions of Credit. Loans and extensions of credit to Directors and Executive Officers by Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association must be approved by Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association's Board of Directors and be made in compliance with OTS and Federal Reserve Board regulations. iv. Record-keeping. Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association must identify all Directors, Officers and their Related Interests when making loans or extensions of credit to them. Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association must also specify the amount, type and terms of each loan or extension of credit to these persons and their Related Interests. M. Loans or Gratuities to Examiners. Federal law prohibits a Director, Officer, or Employee of Astoria from making a loan or giving a gratuity to an examiner of Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. N. Exploitation of Relationships. Directors, Officers and Employees must be careful to ensure that Astoria's name is not used in connection with any fraudulent, unethical, dishonest or unauthorized transactions or activities. Astoria's name may not be used to enhance any outside relationships or personal transactions or to imply, without proper authorization, Astoria's sponsorship or support of outside interests. O. Political Contributions. Directors, Officers and Employees are encouraged to support the political party and candidates of their choice. Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association by law cannot make political contributions. Astoria Financial Corporation maintains the Astoria Financial Corporation Political Action Committee ( the "PAC"). The PAC only makes contributions to candidates for federal or state-wide office. Directors, Officers, and Employees shall not otherwise directly or indirectly make gifts or contributions in the name of Astoria to any political committee, candidate, or party. 10
P. Expenses. Directors, Officers and Employees are expected to report all transactions, claims, business related expenses, purchases and travel accurately and honestly. This includes, but is not limited to, time worked, the reporting of health, disability or other claims, and any other information requested by or furnished to Astoria. Q. Employment of Officers and Employees by Directors, Officers or Affiliated Persons. Astoria does not permit any Officer or Employee to be employed at any time by a Director, Officer or Affiliated Person unless Astoria consents in advance to such activity. If consent is given, the Officer or Employee shall not work for the Director, Officer or Affiliated Person during the hours such individual is scheduled to work for Astoria. R. Safety and Soundness. An unsafe or unsound practice is any action or inaction which is contrary to generally accepted standards of prudent operation, the possible consequences of which, if continued, would be abnormal risk, loss or damage to Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, its depositors or the FDIC. Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association is legally and ethically bound to operate in a safe and sound manner. Moreover, Directors and Officers of the Association have a fiduciary responsibility to insure that the Association operates in a safe and sound manner. Directors and Officers shou1d avoid unsafe and unsound practices. S. Corporate Opportunity. Federal regulations govern corporate opportunity in savings institutions and dictate the standards for Director and Officer behavior in this area. Officers, Directors and Employees of Astoria have a duty to protect and promote the best interests of Astoria and refrain from engaging in competitive business conduct with Astoria. Directors, Officers and Employees must not take advantage of a business opportunity for their own, or for another person's personal profit or benefit when the opportunity is within the corporate powers of Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association or when the opportunity is of present practical advantage to Astoria, i.e. Astoria is currently engaged in such activity or the activity is under consideration by Astoria. 11
If a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person engages in such an opportunity before Astoria has considered and rejected it and authorized that person's utilization of the opportunity, Astoria may, in addition to any other disciplinary action Astoria may take with respect to such Director, Officer, or Employee, claim the benefit of the transaction or business. IV. Dealing with Astoria or Assets of Astoria All Directors, Officers and Employees are expected to protect Astoria's property, both tangible and intangible, including without limitation, products, services, customer contacts, information, furnishings, equipment and supplies, and to ensure their efficient use. The misuse or removal of Astoria's property from its facilities is prohibited, unless specifically authorized. This applies equally to property, such as furnishings, equipment and supplies, as well as to property created, obtained or reproduced by Astoria for its exclusive use such as client lists, files, reference materials and reports, computer software, data processing systems, and data bases. Neither originals nor copies may be removed from Astoria's premises or used for purposes other than Astoria business without Astoria's authorization. The integrity of the computer programs and data that comprise the information assets of Astoria must not be compromised. Care must be exercised to protect against intentional or unintentional corruption. Theft, carelessness or waste of Astoria's property shall not be permitted. Astoria's products and services are its property, and the contributions a Director, Officer or Employee makes to their development and implementation while employed by Astoria are Astoria's property and remain its property even after the Director, Officer or Employee leaves Astoria. Astoria shall not, directly or indirectly, purchase or lease from, jointly own with, or sell or lease to, a Director, Officer, or Affiliated Person any interest in real or personal property, unless: A. The transaction is submitted to and approved by the Board of Directors; B. The Officer or Director, or if an Affiliated Person, than the Officer or Director with whom the Affiliated Person is related shall refrain from participating in the consideration or determination of the matter by the Board of Directors; and C. The Transaction is: i. intended for Astoria's benefit and not merely an accommodation for the Director, Officer or Affiliated Person; and ii. determined to be on terms that are not more favorable to the Director, Officer or Affiliated Person than would be available in an arms length transaction in the open market between unrelated parties. 12
As a matter of policy, such transactions are to be discouraged. This policy also covers the following additional business dealings: A. The use of Astoria Federal personnel, facilities, or real or personal property for other than Astoria's benefit; B. The payment by Astoria of commissions and/or fees, including, but not limited to, brokerage commissions or investment banking, management, consulting, architectural or legal fees; and C. Service agreements. NOTE: For purposes of this Code of Conduct, a business dealing between Astoria and an immediate family member of an Officer, Director, Affiliated Person or any other person not otherwise covered in this Code which results in a direct or indirect economic benefit to an Affiliated Person, is considered a business dealing between Astoria and that Affiliated Person. Astoria shall not, either directly or indirectly, invest in or purchase the stock or other securities of an Officer, Director or other Affiliated Person. Astoria shall not invest in real estate in which a Director, Officer or Affiliated Person has an equity interest. Any other authorized real estate related business dealings involving a Director, Officer or Affiliated Person and Astoria must: A. be supported by an independent appraisal not prepared by an Affiliated Person or an Officer or Employee; and B. be approved in advance by a resolution duly adopted with full disclosure by a majority (with no Director having an interest in the transaction voting) of the entire Board of Directors of Astoria. Full disclosure must include the Affiliated Person's source of financing for the real property involved in the transaction, including whether Astoria Federal has a deposit relationship with any financial institution or holding company affiliate providing the financing. Astoria must maintain centralized records in a form and manner that will enable easy, independent review of all business dealings with Directors, Officers or other Affiliated Persons. These records shall contain: A. the names of the parties to the transaction; B. specify the relationship of the parties to Astoria or where appropriate the relationship of the parties to any Affiliated Person; 13
C. describe the transaction and its terms; and D. note any dissenting votes cast at the time Astoria's Board of Directors approved the transaction along with the basis of the dissent. Astoria Federal shall not maintain a deposit relationship with any Affiliated Person or with any financial institution or holding company thereof of which an Affiliated Person is a director, if the maintenance of such a deposit relationship has been specifically disapproved by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Directors, Officers and Affiliated Persons may have money on deposit with Astoria on terms and conditions generally available to Employees of Astoria. V. Proper Accounting Adherence to and consistent application of proper and generally accepted accounting principles, policies, rules and internal controls is expected at all times. Complete and accurate data must be provided and maintained so that accounts reflect the true substance of transactions and the financial position of Astoria and the results of Astoria's operations. An Officer or Employee who knows or suspects that false or misleading entries have been made in the records of Astoria or that entries have not been made in such records which should have been made shall inform his or her senior officer or the Director of Human Resources. No Officer or Employee should permit the existence of a "slush fund" or any other fund not properly recorded on Astoria's books, from which unrecorded disbursements may be made. The law requires that all Astoria assets be properly accounted for, and all payments and receipts by Astoria be appropriately recorded. Astoria's executive management shall be fully informed at all times of matters that might be considered sensitive. Accordingly, there shall be full communication with executive management and their designees even when it might appear to an Officer or Employee that less candor is desirable to protect Astoria or to make the management group look good. Moreover, there shall be no concealment of information in dealing with the Astoria's independent and internal auditors, examiners or legal counsel. VI. Compliance with Other Laws Bribery is the giving of money or anything else of value in an attempt to unlawfully influence the action of a public official. No Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person shall pay, offer or authorize any bribe or make any other unlawful payment on behalf of Astoria no matter how small the amount. This prohibition extends to payments to consultants, agents and other intermediaries when the Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person has some reason to believe that some part of the payment or "fee" will be used to bribe or otherwise improperly influence governmental action. It is a violation of Federal law if a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person, among other things, solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business or transaction of Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. By policy, this Code extends this prohibition to any business or transaction of Astoria. 14
Any gift which is prohibited under this Code must be refused or returned by a Director, Officer or Employee to whom it is offered or by whom it is received. The Director, Officer or Employee should take the opportunity to tactfully, but clearly, communicate Astoria's policy prohibiting its Directors, Officers or Employees from accepting such gifts from customers or suppliers. All such offers and returns of such gifts, excluding those relating to Directors or Executive Officers, must be reported in writing to your Department or Division Head and the Director of Human Resources. All such offers and returns of such gifts involving Executive Officers, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, should be reported to the Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Human Resources. All such offers and returns of such gifts involving the Directors or the Chief Executive Officer shall be reported to the Compensation Committee and the General Counsel. If a gift is received which is improper, but which is impractical or awkward to return, the gift should be reported to the Director of Human Resources, who will direct that the gift will be donated, without tax deduction, to a charitable organization selected by Astoria. The supplier or customer that presented the gift will be notified of the donation. It is important to note that the above rules apply even though a Director, Officer or Employee actually receives the thing of value after terminating service or employment with Astoria. There are a number of instances where a Director, an Officer or Employee without risk of corruption or breach of trust, may accept things of value from someone doing or seeking to do business with the Association. Examples of activities which violate this Code or would be acceptable conduct are outlined below. The following are examples of conduct that violate this Code: Employee X solicits a payment from a real estate broker who wants to secure home mortgage loans from Astoria for his clients. Employee X tells the broker that the chances of his clients getting loans will be better if he makes the payment to Employee X. Employee Y offers Astoria's fee appraiser a monetary reward if the appraiser writes the appraisal on a piece of real estate in a certain way to ensure that Astoria will make the loan on the property. Employee Z who negotiates contracts for Astoria with persons who supply material or services to Astoria accepts a substantial, excessive gift from a supplier. As a result of perception, the frequent acceptance of small de minimis gifts may also give rise to a problem. In this regard, it is expected that prudent judgement will be exercised at all times. 15
On the other hand, a Director, Officer or Employee of Astoria may: A. Accept meals, refreshments, travel arrangements and accommodations or entertainment, all of reasonable value, in the course of a meeting or other occasion, the purpose of which is to hold bona fide business discussions, foster better business relations or involves charitable fund raising. A good guide to use in such instances is whether the expense would be paid for or reimbursed by Astoria as a reasonable business expense if not paid for by another party. B. Accept advertising or promotional material of reasonable value such as pens, pencils, note pads, key chains, coin banks, calendars and similar items. C. Accept gifts of reasonable value related to commonly recognized events or occasions, such as promotion, new job, wedding, retirement, Christmas or bar or bat mitzvah. D. Accept civic, charitable, educational or religious organizational awards for recognition of service and accomplishment. Federal law and our internal policies requires Astoria to conduct its affairs in conformity with federal and applicable state statutes, laws, rules and regulations, including the regulations promulgated by the applicable Federal banking agencies. Astoria is further required to maintain complete and accurate records, and to periodically report on its condition to the applicable regulators. It is Astoria's policy to obey both foreign and domestic tax laws and foreign exchange control laws. No Director, Officer or Employee shall on behalf of Astoria enter into any transaction that such individual knows or reasonably should know would violate such laws. Neither Astoria nor its Directors, Officers or Employees should assist any third party in violating the laws of any country. This policy applies whether or not the Astoria's assistance itself violates the laws of any country. Federal law prohibits Astoria from disclosing information regarding its customers except in limited circumstances and requires Astoria to maintain security measures to safeguard such information. No Director, Officer or Employee may use or disclose customer information except as permitted by Astoria's Privacy Policy and Information Security Policy. VII. Enforcement and Reporting A. Enforcement. The Director of Human Resources is responsible for enforcing compliance with this Code. The Director of Human Resources and the Director of Internal Audit Services will conduct reviews to ensure compliance with this Code by Directors, Officers and Employees. 16
Violation of this Code by Directors, Officers, Employees and Affiliated Persons are matters of the utmost concern. A Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person who compromises or violates the law or policies and procedures contained in this Code may be subject to disciplinary actions which include suspension, demotion or immediate termination for cause. Directors, Officers, Employees and Affiliated Persons may also be subject to civil and/or criminal prosecution. Corrective action or any other response to a breach of this Code with respect to an Officer or Employee of Astoria must be approved by the Director of Human Resources. Any corrective action or waiver involving a Director or Executive Officer shall be reported to and must be approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of Astoria Financial Corporation and shall be promptly disclosed to the shareholders of Astoria. B. Reporting. The Code requires each Director, Officer or Employee to complete an Employee Acknowledgment and Disclosure Form and return it to the Director of Human Resources within five (5) business days of the Director's, Officer's or Employee's receipt of the Code. Subsequent Employee Acknowledgment and Disclosure Forms will be filed annually on or about January 31st of each year. A Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person has a duty to identify and eliminate conflicts of interest and the appearance of such conflicts as they arise in the course of their service to or employment with Astoria. An Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person must disclose conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts to the Director of Human Resources. Directors, the Executive Officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, shall also disclose conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts to the Board of Directors and the Director of Internal Audit. If a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person is not sure that a conflict of interest exits, but suspects there may be one, or that an appearance of a conflict of interest exists or could arise, the Director, Officer, or Affiliated Person should disclose such instances to the Director of Human Resources or, if applicable, the Board of Directors and the Director of Internal Audit Services. A Director who may experience a direct or indirect benefit in connection with a matter before the Board of Directors has a conflict of interest and, therefore, would breach his or her fiduciary duties if he or she fails to disclose to the Board of Directors all material, non-privileged information relevant to the Board's deliberations with respect to the matter. 17
A Director must disclose at a minimum the following information: i) the existence of the nature and extent of his or her conflicting interest; and ii) the facts known to the Director as to the matter or transaction under consideration. Information about any known or suspected violations of any provision of this Code on the part of any Director, Officer, Employee, Affiliated Person, customer, independent agent, adjuster, appraiser, supplier or vendor should be reported immediately to the Director of Human Resources. Astoria shall neither impose penalties nor take any retaliatory actions against any Officer or Employee who reports violations or suspected violations as long as the Officer or Employee has not personally committed or assisted in the commission of a violation. No action, including the acceptance of restitution, should be taken against or on behalf of any Officer or Employee suspected of committing fraud, a dishonest act or unethical conduct without prior review by the Director of Human Resources. No final action, including the acceptance of restitution, should be taken against or on behalf of any Director or Executive Officer suspected of committing fraud, a dishonest act or unethical conduct without prior review by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Directors, Officers and Employees are required to cooperate with all conflict of interest or business conduct investigations carried out by Astoria. Requests for information by law enforcement officials should be immediately referred to the attention of the Director of Security. Federal law stipulates that Executive Officers, Directors and Principal Shareholders (controlling persons) must report their Related Interests annually. Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association will maintain records which identify all Directors and Officers and their Related Interests. Pursuant to Federal law, a Director or Officer, on behalf of Astoria Federal, must report crimes, suspected crimes, or unexplained losses ("suspicious activity") encountered in the performance his or her duties. Such reports should be made to the Director of Security. The Director of Security shall investigate such activity and determine whether the filing of a Suspicious Activity Report is required or advisable. In the event the Director of Security is suspected of being involved in the violation(s), the report should be made to the Director of Internal Audit Services. Federal law further stipulates that Astoria Federal has an obligation to report violations to both the appropriate law enforcement authorities and the OTS. 18
Any Suspicious Activity Report must be submitted to a committee consisting of Mr. Gerard C. Keegan, Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer and Mr. Alan P. Eggleston, Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, both of whom are Executive Officers. If they deem the suspicious activity appropriate for review by the Board of Directors, they shall report the matter to the Board of Directors. C. Confidential Reporting. While this Code provides that reporting violations or suspected violations of this Code will not result in disciplinary or retaliatory action against the reporting person unless that person has themselves violated or assisted in violating this Code, Astoria recognizes that Officers or Employees may still be reluctant to step forward, even if it is their duty to do so. In an effort to alleviate these concerns, Astoria has retained the services of Shareholder.Com to provide to Officers and Employees a method to confidentially report violations or suspected violations of this Code or otherwise communicate concerns to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board. Officers and Employees can leave confidential messages with Shareholder.Com by calling 866-886-1349, by e-mail at af@openboard.info or by Web based submissions at http://www.openboard.info/af/. Correspondence can also be delivered in a sealed envelope addressed as follows: Chairman of the Audit Committee Astoria Financial Corporation c/o Alan P. Eggleston Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel One Astoria Federal Plaza Lake Success, New York 11042 Personal and Confidential Such correspondence will be delivered by the Secretary to the Chairman of the Audit Committee unopened. In response to such communications, the Chairman of the Audit Committee will direct such investigations as he deems appropriate with the assistance of Astoria's internal or external auditors or utilizing such other or additional resources as he deems appropriate. The receipt of such communications by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the investigation undertaken and the results thereof shall be reported by the Chairman of the Audit Committee to the Audit Committee meeting in executive session. Revised: February 16, 2005 19

Exhibit 99.1 ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES 21% INCREASE IN FIRST QUARTER EPS TO $0.57 Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.20 Per Common Share Declared LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., April 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income increased to $59.5 million, or $0.57 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, up 11% and 21%, respectively, from $53.4 million, or $0.47 diluted EPS, for the 2004 first quarter. For the 2005 first quarter, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets increased to 17.42%, 20.15% and 1.02%, respectively, from 15.05%, 17.31% and 0.95%, respectively, for the comparable 2004 period. First Quarter 2005 Highlights: * Diluted EPS: $0.57, increased $0.10, or 21%, from comparable period last year * Net interest margin: 2.24%, increased 10 basis points, or 5%, from comparable period last year * Return on average equity: 17.42%, increased 16% from comparable period last year * Return on average tangible equity: 20.15%, increased 16% from comparable period last year * Return on average assets: 1.02%, increased 7% from comparable period last year * Total deposits increased $246 million, or 8% annualized -- Core deposits (1) increased $99 million, or 7% annualized -- Cost of core deposits: 44 basis points * Loan portfolio increased $297 million, or 9% annualized -- Multifamily/Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") loan portfolios increased $110 million, or 13% annualized, and represent 27% of total loans -- One-to-Four Family loan portfolio increased $178 million, or 8% annualized * Securities portfolio declined $388 million, or 18% annualized * Borrowings declined $488 million, or 21% annualized * Non-performing assets declined $3.4 million to $30.1 million, or 0.13% of total assets * Repurchased 1.1 million common shares (1) Includes savings, money market, checking and Liquid CD accounts Commenting on the first quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "Our financial performance in the first quarter was marked by solid increases in earnings, earnings per share and related returns, reflecting our success in improving the quality of the balance sheet and earnings through robust growth of retail deposits and mortgage loans, both core businesses."
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.20 Per Share The Board of Directors of the Company, at their April 20, 2005 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share. The dividend is payable on June 1, 2005 to shareholders of record as of May 16, 2005. This is the fortieth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Tenth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the first quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $25.53 per share. To date, under the tenth program that commenced during the 2004 third quarter, Astoria has repurchased 6.3 million shares of the 12 million shares authorized. First Quarter 2005 Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 totaled $125.2 million, an increase of 9% from $114.5 million a year ago, primarily attributable to an increase in interest earning assets and a decline in the cost of liabilities. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 increased ten basis points from a year ago to 2.24%, primarily due to a decline in the cost of liabilities as higher cost borrowings were repriced at lower rates. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin increased six basis points, due to the benefit derived from two less days of interest expense in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 totaled $24.7 million compared to $22.1 million for the 2004 first quarter. The improvement is due to increases in customer service fees of $1.2 million and mortgage banking income, net, of $4.0 million as described below, partially offset by the absence of gains on sales of securities in the 2005 first quarter compared to gains on sales of securities of $2.4 million for the 2004 first quarter. The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non- interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 1Q05 1Q04 ---------------------------- -------- -------- Loan servicing fees $ 1.3 $ 1.5 Amortization of MSR* (1.5) (2.0) MSR* valuation adjustments 2.4 (1.3) Net gain on sale of loans 0.7 0.7 Mortgage banking income, net $ 2.9 $ (1.1) *Mortgage servicing rights General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 totaled $60.5 million compared to $57.0 million for the comparable 2004 period. The increase is primarily due to increased advertising expense related to, among other things, the introduction of a business deposit marketing campaign and $1.8 million of increased goodwill litigation expense associated with the commencement of the trial of the Long Island Bancorp case in January 2005, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits expense and occupancy, equipment and systems expense. G&A expenses in future quarters this year are expected to be somewhat lower due to reduced advertising and goodwill litigation expense.
Balance Sheet Summary Due to the current flattening yield curve environment and lower spread availability, as previously announced, we reduced our non-core business activities during the first quarter of 2005. Total securities declined $387.6 million, or 18% annualized, to $8.3 billion at March 31, 2005 representing 36% of total assets, of which $2.2 billion, or 10% of total assets, are categorized as available-for-sale. Borrowings also declined in the first quarter by $488.4 million, or 21% annualized, to $9.0 billion at March 31, 2005 representing 39% of total assets. Total assets declined $165.4 million from December 31, 2004 to $23.3 billion at March 31, 2005 while our core lending and deposit businesses grew. Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow: (Dollars in millions) 12/31/99 12/31/00 12/31/01 12/31/02 --------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- Assets $ 22,700 $ 22,341 $ 22,672 $ 21,702 Loans $ 10,286 $ 11,422 $ 12,167 $ 12,059 MBS & Other Sec $ 10,763 $ 9,415 $ 8,013 $ 7,834 Deposits $ 9,555 $ 10,072 $ 10,904 $ 11,067 Core Deposits (1) $ 4,625 $ 4,922 $ 5,743 $ 5,914 Borrowings $ 11,528 $ 10,324 $ 9,826 $ 8,825 Change 12/31/99- (Dollars in millions) 12/31/03 12/31/04 3/31/05 3/31/05 --------------------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- Assets $ 22,462 $ 23,416 $ 23,250 +2% Loans $ 12,687 $ 13,263 $ 13,560 +32% MBS & Other Sec $ 8,448 $ 8,710 $ 8,322 -23% Deposits $ 11,187 $ 12,323 $ 12,569 +32% Core Deposits (1) $ 5,685 $ 5,475 $ 5,574 +21% Borrowings $ 9,632 $ 9,470 $ 8,981 -22% (1) Includes savings, money market, checking and Liquid CD accounts During the 2005 first quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $177.6 million, or 8% annualized, to $9.2 billion at March 31, 2005. Loan originations and purchases totaled $726.8 million for the 2005 first quarter compared to $617.3 million in the year-ago first quarter. 77% of the 2005 first quarter production consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans.
During the 2005 first quarter, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $110.3 million, or 13% annualized, to $3.6 billion at March 31, 2005. Originations totaled $256.6 million for the 2005 first quarter compared to $240.0 million for the comparable 2004 period. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. At March 31, 2005, non-performing loans declined to $29.7 million, or 0.13%, of total assets from $32.6 million, or 0.14% of total assets, at December 31, 2004. Net charge-offs for the 2005 first quarter totaled just $28,000, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of the average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non- performing loans at March 31, 2005 was 279%. Deposits for the quarter ended March 31, 2005 increased $246.1 million, or 8% on an annualized basis, to $12.6 billion from $12.3 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase was due, in part, to an increase in core deposits resulting from the successful introduction of a Liquid CD account during the quarter. Total core deposits rose $99.2 million, or 7% annualized, to $5.6 billion at March 31, 2005. The cost of core deposits was just 44 basis points, up 8 basis points from the previous quarter. During the first quarter, we also continued to grow our medium-term CD deposits at a significant discount to alternative funding sources that, in addition to contributing to the management of interest rate risk, permits us to reduce our borrowing levels and continues to produce new customers from our communities, creating relationship development opportunities. During the 2005 first quarter, $1.0 billion of CDs, with an average rate of 3.10% and an average original maturity of 25 months matured and $1.1 billion of non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 3.00% and an average maturity of 20 months. Stockholders' equity was $1.4 billion, or 5.88% of total assets at March 31, 2005. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.31%, 6.31% and 12.82%, respectively, at March 31, 2005. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2005, Mr. Engelke stated, "We continue to face a challenging operating environment as a result of rising short term interest rates and a continuing flattening of the yield curve. Accordingly, we anticipate a continued shrinkage of the balance sheet with the reduction in borrowings and securities through normal cash flow, while we continue to grow deposits and loans, all of which will continue to improve the quality of the balance sheet and earnings. This strategy should better position us to take advantage of more profitable asset growth opportunities when the yield curve steepens."

Exhibit 99.1 ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION REQUESTS COURT TO GRANT JUDGMENT FOR $594 MILLION FROM U.S. FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("the Company") announced that in its closing argument before United States Court of Federal Claims Judge Charles F. Lettow on July 7, 2005, it asked for damages totaling $594 million from the U.S. government for breach of contract in connection with a 1983 Assistance Agreement ("the Agreement") between the Long Island Savings Bank ("LISB") and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ("FSLIC") pursuant to which LISB acquired a failing thrift. The acquisition was a product of the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980's during which time the U.S. government encouraged the acquisition of struggling thrift institutions by healthier institutions, thereby sparing the government the cost of liquidating the failing institutions. The Assistance Agreement provided for, among other things, the inclusion of supervisory goodwill, i.e. the difference between the value of the acquired assets less the acquired liabilities, as an asset to be included in regulatory capital and amortized over forty years. The lawsuit, The Long Island Savings Bank, FSB, et al. vs. The United States, Docket No. 92-517-C, commenced in 1989 when Congress eliminated unamortized supervisory goodwill as a component of regulatory capital which resulted in LISB writing off approximately $500 million of supervisory goodwill. LISB was subsequently acquired by Astoria Financial Corporation in 1998. No assurance can be given as to the timing or content of the Court's decision or the ultimate outcome in this matter. Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $23.3 billion is the fifth largest thrift institution in the United States. Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $12.6 billion and embraces its philosophy of putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, http://www.astoriafederal.com.

Exhibit 99.1 ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES 6% INCREASE IN SECOND QUARTER EPS TO $0.55 QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.20 PER COMMON SHARE DECLARED LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported diluted earnings per share ("EPS") for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 of $0.55, a 6% increase from $0.52 EPS for the 2004 second quarter. Net income for the 2005 second quarter totaled $57.4 million compared to $57.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004. Included in 2005 net income and EPS is a mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") impairment charge of $2.5 million ($1.7 million after-tax, or $0.02 per share) compared to a recovery of $5.2 million ($3.5 million after-tax, or $0.03 per share) in the 2004 second quarter. (Excluding the MSR adjustments in the 2005 and 2004 second quarters, EPS would have been $0.57 and $0.49, respectively.) For the 2005 second quarter, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 16.66%, 19.24% and 1.00%, respectively, compared to 16.55%, 19.09% and 1.03%, respectively, for the comparable 2004 period. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, net income totaled $116.9 million, or $1.12 EPS, up 5% and 13%, respectively, from $110.9 million, or $0.99 EPS for the comparable 2004 period. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets increased to 17.02%, 19.68%, and 1.01%, respectively, from 15.85%, 18.27% and 0.99%, respectively, for the comparable 2004 period. Second Quarter 2005 Highlights: - Net interest margin: 2.21%, up 8 basis points from comparable period last year - Return on average equity: 16.66%, up 11 basis points from comparable period last year - Return on average tangible equity: 19.24%, up 15 basis points from comparable period last year - Loan portfolio increased $190 million, or 6% annualized -- Multifamily/Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") loan portfolios increased $131 million, or 14% annualized, and represent 27% of total loans -- One-to-Four Family loan portfolio increased $35 million, or 2% annualized - Securities portfolio declined $553 million, or 27% annualized - Borrowings declined $413 million, or 18% annualized - Assets declined $424 million, or 7% annualized - Repurchased 1.5 million common shares - Non-performing assets: $30.1 million, or 0.13% of total assets Commenting on the 2005 second quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "While our financial results were solid, they were tempered by a $2.5 million ($1.7 million after-tax, or $0.02 per share) MSR impairment charge due to the decline in long term interest rates at the end of the second quarter. Overall, the operating environment continued to be challenging as the yield curve flattened, with short term interest rates increasing and long term interest rates decreasing. In light of this, we continued our strategy of reducing the securities portfolio and borrowings while growing the total loan portfolio even as increased refinance activity during the quarter restrained growth in the one-to-four family loan portfolio. While deposits grew modestly, we are pleased with the continued growth in our Liquid CD accounts as well as our success in increasing and extending medium-term retail CDs in anticipation of increasing interest rates."
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.20 Per Share The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 20, 2005 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share. The dividend is payable on September 1, 2005 to shareholders of record as of August 15, 2005. This is the forty-first consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Tenth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the second quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $27.14 per share. For the six month period ended June 30, 2005 Astoria repurchased 2.6 million shares. To date, under the tenth program that commenced during the 2004 third quarter, Astoria has repurchased 7.8 million shares of the 12 million shares authorized. Second Quarter 2005 Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 increased 7% to $121.3 million from $113.3 million a year ago. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, net interest income increased 8% to $246.6 million from $227.8 million in the 2004 six month period. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 increased eight basis points from a year ago to 2.21%, primarily due to an increase in the yield on average earning assets resulting from lower premium amortization expense in the 2005 second quarter. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased three basis points primarily due to one extra day of interest expense in the second quarter. Commenting on the net interest margin, Mr. Engelke noted, "Clearly, continuing to reduce the lower yielding securities portfolio and borrowings has helped mitigate margin compression in the current yield curve environment." Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 totaled $22.5 million compared to $27.9 million for the 2004 second quarter. The decline is primarily due to a $7.9 million decrease in mortgage banking income, net, offset by a $1.8 million increase in customer service fees. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, non-interest income totaled $47.3 million compared to $50.0 million for the comparable 2004 period. The decline was primarily due to decreases in mortgage banking income, net, of $3.7 million and gains on sale of securities of $2.4 million, offset by a $2.9 million increase in customer service fees. The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non- interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 2Q05 2Q04 1H05 1H04 - ------------------------ ---------- ---------- ---------- ---------- Loan servicing fees $ 1.3 $ 1.5 $ 2.6 $ 3.0 Amortization of MSR (1.3) (1.8) (2.7) (3.8) MSR valuation adjustments (2.5) 5.2 (0.1) 3.8 Net gain on sale of loans 0.9 1.4 1.6 2.1 Mortgage banking income, net $ (1.6) $ 6.3 $ 1.4 $ 5.1 General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 totaled $57.6 million compared to $55.4 million for the comparable 2004 period. The increase is primarily due to an increase in goodwill litigation expense to $2.0 million from $874,000 in last year's second quarter. On a linked quarter basis, G&A declined $2.9 million, primarily due to reduced advertising expense and lower compensation and benefits expense.
For the six months ended June 30, 2005, G&A totaled $118.1 million compared to $112.4 million for the comparable six months ended June 30, 2004. The increase was primarily due to an increase in goodwill litigation expense to $4.7 million from $1.7 million in the 2004 six month period and increased advertising expense. Balance Sheet Summary Due to the current flattening yield curve environment and lower spread availability, we continued to reduce our non-core business activities during the second quarter of 2005. Total securities for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 declined $552.8 million, or 27% annualized, to $7.8 billion at June 30, 2005, representing 34% of total assets, of which $2.1 billion, or 9% of total assets, are categorized as available-for-sale. Borrowings declined in the second quarter of 2005 by $412.6 million, or 18% annualized, to $8.6 billion at June 30, 2005, representing 38% of total assets. For the six months ended June 30, 2005 total securities declined $940.4 million, or 22% annualized. and borrowings declined $901.0 million, or 19% annualized. Total assets declined $424.4 million from March 31, 2005 and $589.8 million from December 31, 2004 and total $22.8 billion at June 30, 2005. Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow: (Dollars in millions) (1) Includes savings, money market, checking and Liquid CD accounts During the 2005 second quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $34.7 million, or 2% annualized, to $9.3 billion at June 30, 2005. Originations and purchases totaled $707.1 million for the 2005 second quarter compared to $933.7 million in the year-ago second quarter. 78% of the 2005 second quarter production consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $212.3 million, or 5% annualized. Originations and purchases for the 2005 six month period totaled $1.4 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the year-ago six month period.
During the 2005 second quarter, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $130.5 million, or 14% annualized, to $3.7 billion at June 30, 2005. Originations totaled $241.9 million for the 2005 second quarter compared to $274.0 million for the comparable 2004 period. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. For the 2005 six month period, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $240.8 million, or 14% annualized. Originations totaled $498.5 million for the 2005 six month period compared to $514.1 million for the comparable 2004 period. At June 30, 2005, non-performing loans declined to $28.7 million, or 0.13% of total assets, from $29.7 million, or 0.13% of total assets, at March 31, 2005. Net charge-offs for the 2005 second quarter totaled $211,000. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, net charge-offs totaled $239,000, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of the average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at June 30, 2005 was 288%. Deposits for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 increased slightly and totaled $12.6 billion at June 30, 2005. During the second quarter, we continued to grow our medium-term CD deposits at a significant discount to alternative funding sources that, in addition to contributing to the management of interest rate risk, permit us to reduce our borrowing levels and continue to produce new customers from our communities, creating relationship development opportunities. During the 2005 second quarter, $804.4 million of non-Liquid CDs, with an average rate of 2.54% and an average original maturity of 17 months, matured and $839.4 million of non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 3.09% and an average maturity of 16 months. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, deposits increased $262.0 million, or 4% annualized. The increase was due, in part, to an increase in Liquid CD accounts and medium term CD accounts. At June 30, 2005 core deposits totaled $5.5 billion with an average cost of just 50 basis points for the second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, $1.8 billion of non-Liquid CDs, with an average rate of 2.85% and an average original maturity of 21 months matured and $1.9 billion of non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 3.04% and an average maturity of 18 months. Stockholders' equity was $1.4 billion, or 6.10% of total assets at June 30, 2005. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.71%, 6.71% and 13.33%, respectively, at June 30, 2005. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for the second half of 2005, Mr. Engelke stated, "The operating environment continues to remain challenging as a result of rising short term interest rates and a continuing flattening of the yield curve. Accordingly, we will continue our strategy of shrinking the securities portfolio and borrowings through normal cash flow, while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve the quality of the balance sheet and earnings and will help maintain the margin at current to slightly lower levels in the second half of 2005. This strategy should better position us to take advantage of more profitable asset growth opportunities when the yield curve steepens." Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $22.8 billion is the fifth largest thrift institution in the United States. Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $12.6 billion and embraces its philosophy of Putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, http://www.astoriafederal.com.

Exhibit 99.1 ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION TO OUTSOURCE ITS MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Aug. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings & Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), announced that it has entered into an outsourcing agreement with Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc. ("DMI"), a mortgage loan servicing company located in Schaumberg, Illinois. Pursuant to the agreement, DMI will undertake the subservicing of Astoria Federal's loan portfolio, effective December 2005, on a "private label" basis and will perform on behalf of Astoria Federal. According to George L. Engelke, Jr., Astoria's Chairman, President & CEO, "The decision to take this action was driven entirely by economics. Our mortgage servicing staff has consistently performed at high levels. In fact, in my more than 43 years of association with Astoria Federal, our loan delinquencies have never been lower and remain among the lowest in the industry. However, in an environment of ever-increasing competitive pressure, we must and will continue to strive to increase operating efficiency in all aspects of our operations. Today, despite the fact that our individual mortgage loan balances are larger, the number of loans we service has decreased over the past several years, thereby lowering operating efficiency. DMI currently services loans for multiple financial institutions and is among the leading subservicers in the country. We are confident that they will continue to provide our borrowers with the quality service they have been accustomed to receiving from our mortgage servicing staff." The transaction will result in the recording of a charge of approximately $1 million, pre-tax, in the 2005 third quarter and should result in annual savings of approximately $2 million, pre-tax, beginning in 2006. Core Business Growth Continues; Solid Loan Growth Expected in Second Half of 2005 Astoria indicated that it will continue its strong focus on growing its core businesses, retail banking and mortgage lending and that this transaction will improve its already superior operating efficiency. The strong loan origination platform, which includes retail, broker and correspondent networks throughout the country, should facilitate continued growth in its loan portfolios for the remainder of 2005. During the first half of 2005, Astoria Federal's loan total loan portfolio grew by $487 million, or 7% annualized. Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $22.8 billion is the sixth largest thrift institution in the United States. Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $12.6 billion and embraces its philosophy of Putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, http://www.astoriafederal.com. Astoria Federal commands the fourth largest deposit market share in the attractive Long Island market, which includes Brooklyn, Queens, Nassau and Suffolk counties with a population exceeding that of 39 individual states. Astoria Federal originates mortgage loans through its banking offices and loan production offices in New York, an extensive broker network in twenty-three states, primarily the East Coast and the District of Columbia, and through correspondent relationships in forty-four states and the District of Columbia.

Nevertheless, we continued our strategy of improving the quality of the balance sheet by producing solid deposit and loan growth while significantly reducing securities and borrowings through normal cash flow. These efforts resulted in solid increases in earnings, earnings per share and related returns for the third quarter." Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.20 Per Share The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 19, 2005 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per common share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2005 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2005. This is the forty-second consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Tenth Stock Repurchase Program Continues During the third quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $27.83 per share. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2005 Astoria repurchased 4.1 million shares at an average cost of $26.95 per share. To date, under the tenth program that commenced during the 2004 third quarter, Astoria has repurchased 9.5 million shares of the 12 million shares authorized. Hurricane Katrina Disaster Relief Donation Astoria has pledged to donate $341,000 to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund to benefit the Gulf Coast victims of Hurricane Katrina. The donation, which is reflected in 2005 third quarter general and administrative expense, includes a $250,000 corporate leadership donation and related double matching funds of $91,000 in support of director, officer and employee contributions totaling $45,500. Third Quarter and Nine Month 2005 Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 totaled $118.5 million compared to $121.9 million a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, net interest income increased 4% to $365.1 million from $349.7 million in the 2004 nine month period. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 declined five basis points from the same period a year ago to 2.20%. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased just one basis point. Commenting on the net interest margin, Mr. Engelke noted, "Clearly, continuing to reduce the lower yielding securities portfolio and borrowings while growing loans and deposits has helped mitigate margin compression in the current yield curve environment." Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 increased 18% to $28.4 million from $24.0 million for the 2004 third quarter. The increase is primarily due to a $4.9 million increase in mortgage banking income, net, and $2.5 million in customer service fees, primarily offset by the absence of gains on sales of securities and lower other operating income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, non-interest income increased to $75.6 million from $74.0 million for the comparable 2004 period. The increase was primarily due to a $5.4 million increase in customer service fees and a $1.2 million increase in mortgage banking income, net, primarily offset by a $4.7 million decline in gains on sales of securities in the 2005 nine month period. The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 3Q05 3Q04 9 Mos05 9 Mos04 --------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Loan servicing fees $ 1.2 $ 1.4 $ 3.8 $ 4.4 Amortization of MSR* (1.3) (1.4) (4.0) (5.2) MSR valuation adjustments 2.7 (1.9) 2.6 1.9 Net gain on sale of loans 1.1 0.7 2.7 2.8 Mortgage banking income (loss), net $ 3.7 $ (1.2) $ 5.1 $ 3.9 * Mortgage servicing rights General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 declined to $57.9 million from $59.2 million for the comparable 2004 period. The decrease is primarily due to a $3.2 million arbitration award settlement in the 2004 third quarter, partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in the 2005 third quarter G&A related to the previously announced decision to outsource mortgage servicing and additional one-time expenses related to other company-wide cost saving initiatives undertaken to improve future operating efficiency. The one-time expenses incurred in the 2005 third quarter are expected to result in annual net expense savings of approximately $5 million commencing in 2006. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, G&A totaled $176.0 million compared to $171.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The increase is primarily due to an increase in advertising expense and other non- interest expense including charitable contributions and cost-saving initiatives.
Balance Sheet Summary Due to the current flattening yield curve environment and lower spread availability, we continued to reduce our non-core business activities during the third quarter of 2005. Total securities for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 declined $680.9 million, or 35% annualized, to $7.1 billion at September 30, 2005, or 31% of total assets, of which $2.0 billion, or 9% of total assets, are categorized as available-for-sale. Borrowings declined $469.3 million in the third quarter of 2005, or 22% annualized, to $8.1 billion at September 30, 2005, representing 36% of total assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005 total securities declined $1.6 billion, or 25% annualized, and borrowings declined $1.4 billion, or 19% annualized. Total assets declined $195.4 million from June 30, 2005 and $785.2 million from December 31, 2004 and total $22.6 billion at September 30, 2005. Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow: During the 2005 third quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $242.5 million, or 10% annualized, to $9.5 billion at September 30, 2005. Originations and purchases totaled $983.4 million for the 2005 third quarter compared to $635.3 million in the year-ago third quarter of which 79% and 77%, respectively, consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $454.8 million, or 7% annualized. Originations and purchases for the 2005 nine month period totaled $2.4 billion compared to $2.2 billion for the comparable 2004 period of which 78% and 73%, respectively, consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans. During the 2005 third quarter, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $113.0 million, or 12% annualized, to $3.9 billion at September 30, 2005, or 28% of total loans outstanding. Multifamily and CRE originations totaled $270.6 million for the 2005 third quarter compared to $349.8 million for the comparable 2004 period. The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. For the 2005 nine month period, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $353.8 million, or 13% annualized. Originations totaled $769.0 million for the 2005 nine month period compared to $863.8 million for the comparable 2004 period.
At September 30, 2005, non-performing assets increased to $39.2 million, or 0.17% of total assets, from $30.1 million, or 0.13% of total assets, at June 30, 2005. The increase is due to increases in non-performing multifamily loans. The average LTV of the non-performing multifamily loans at September 30, 2005 is 63.7% with an average debt coverage ratio of 1.60. Subsequent to September 30, 2005, $6.8 million of non-performing mortgage loans have become current or have been paid off. Deposits increased $220.4 million from June 30, 2005, or 7% annualized, and total $12.8 billion at September 30, 2005. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, deposits increased $482.4 million, or 5% annualized. These increases are primarily due to increases in medium-term and Liquid CD accounts. During 2005, we have grown our medium-term CD deposits at a significant discount to alternative funding sources which, in addition to contributing to the management of interest rate risk, permits us to reduce our borrowing levels and continues to produce new customers from our communities, creating relationship development opportunities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2005, $2.5 billion of non-Liquid CDs, with an average rate of 2.70% and an average original maturity of 19 months matured and $2.9 billion of non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced at an average rate of 3.23% and an average maturity of 15 months. Since the introduction of our Liquid CD account in the 2005 first quarter, balances have grown to $479.4 million at September 30, 2005. Core deposits, including Liquid CDs, at September 30, 2005 total $5.4 billion, with an average rate of just 58 basis points for the 2005 third quarter. Stockholders' equity was $1.4 billion, or 6.13% of total assets at September 30, 2005. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.20%, 6.20% and 12.11%, respectively, at September 30, 2005. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2005 and 2006, Mr. Engelke stated, "The operating environment continues to remain challenging as a result of rising short term interest rates and a continuing flattening of the yield curve. Accordingly, we will continue our strategy of shrinking the securities portfolio and borrowings through normal cash flow, while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve the quality of the balance sheet and earnings and will help maintain the margin at current to slightly lower levels. This strategy should better position us to take advantage of more profitable asset growth opportunities when the yield curve steepens."

Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $12.8 billion and embraces its philosophy of Putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, http://www.astoriafederal.com.

ITEMS 2 THROUGH 7 NOT APPLICABLE. ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. a) Option Vesting Acceleration On December 21, 2005, Astoria Financial Corporation's (the "Company") Compensation Committee and Board of Directors approved the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options which were awarded to officers of Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (the Association) on December 17, 2003 (the "2003 Options") and December 15, 2004 (the "2004 Options"). At the time of the acceleration, the unvested 2003 Options represented 1,402,950 shares, each with an exercise price of $24.40 per share, the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant, and, absent earlier vesting due to the death, disability or retirement of the optionee or a change of control of the Company, would have vested on January 10, 2007. The six executive officers of the Company hold 2003 Options which account for 786,750 shares. At the time of the acceleration, the unvested 2004 Options represented 1,897,200 shares, each with an exercise price of $26.6267 per share, the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant, and, absent earlier vesting due to the death, disability or retirement of the optionee or a change of control of the Company, would have vested on January 10, 2008. The six executive officers of the Company hold 2004 Options which account for 1,063,500 shares. The Company placed a restriction on the sale or other transfer of shares acquired through the exercise of 2003 Options or 2004 Options, the vesting of which was accelerated, prior to the earlier of the original vesting date or the date the optionee terminates employment with the Company and the Association. The acceleration was effective on December 22, 2005. The purpose of the acceleration is to enable the Company to eliminate compensation expense associated with these options in future periods upon adoption of FASB Statement No.123R, Share Based Payment, in January 2006. It is anticipated that the accelerated vesting will eliminate potential pre-tax compensation expense in future periods of approximately $10.4 million, or approximately $.06 per share after-tax based upon diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, including pre-tax compensation expense of approximately $6.7 million in 2006 or approximately $0.04 per share after-tax based upon diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2005. As a result of the acceleration, the Company will incur in 2005 approximately $100,000 pre-tax compensation expense. A number of the options which were accelerated, when granted, were intended to qualify as incentive stock options. The accelerated vesting will for most affected optionees disqualify such options upon exercise from incentive stock option tax treatment. The Company, upon the exercise of such disqualified options, may realize certain tax benefits that would not have otherwise been available to it. b) Option Grants and Restricted Stock Awards to the Executive Officers -2-
Pursuant to the terms of the 2005 Re-designated, Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan for Officers and Employees of Astoria Financial Corporation, which was approved by the shareholders of the Company at its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 18, 2005, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors on December 21, 2005 granted the following non-statutory stock options and shares of restricted stock to the executive officers of the Company: The options granted have an exercise price of $29.02, the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant, a 7 year term and vest on January 9, 2009 or earlier upon the optionee's death, disability, retirement at normal retirement age, on a change of control, or, in the case of the executive officers, pursuant to the terms of their respective employment agreements with the Company, upon the termination of their employment by the Company prior to the end of the term of such employment agreement without cause, as defined therein. In other cases, the options would be forfeited upon termination of employment prior to the vesting date. The restricted stock will vest and be distributed effective January 9, 2009 or earlier upon the death, disability or retirement at normal retirement age, on a change of control, or, in the case of the executive officers, pursuant to the terms of their respective employment agreements with the Company, upon the termination of their employment by the Company prior to the end of the term of such employment agreement without cause, as defined therein. In other cases, the restricted stock award would be forfeited upon termination of employment prior to the vesting date. Prior to the vesting date and forfeiture, if any, of such award, the recipient of the award will be eligible to exercise voting rights with respect to such shares and receive cash dividends, if any, declared and paid by the Company with respect to its Common Stock. c) Executive Officer Employment Contract related issues. Following meetings of the Compensation Committees of the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Association held on December 16, 2005 and December 21, 2005, and a meeting of the non-management directors of the Company on December 21, 2005, the Board of Directors of the Association extended the employment agreements of the six executive officers by one year so that the term of such contracts is three years each. The employment contracts between the six executive officers and the Company absent notice by either party automatically renew each day to maintain their term at three years at all times. -3-
In addition, the Board of Directors, following such meetings, also approved salary increases for 2006 for the six executive officers as follows: Name 2005 Salary 2006 Salary - ----------------------- ----------- ----------- George L. Engelke, Jr. $ 1,050,000 $ 1,100,000 Monte N. Redman $ 570,000 $ 600,000 Gerard C. Keegan $ 502,000 $ 524,000 Arnold K. Greenberg $ 463,000 $ 483,000 Alan P. Eggleston $ 420,000 $ 445,000 Gary T. McCann $ 375,000 $ 400,000 Prior to granting the equity based compensation noted above, extending the Association employment agreements and establishing the 2006 salaries for the executive officers, the Compensation Committee retained the services of Watson Wyatt to, among other things review the reasonableness of such compensation. The Compensation Committee also considered the performance and accomplishments of the executives and the Company during 2005, reviewed the aggregate compensation paid to each of the executive officers over the preceding three years, the executive's investment in the Company and compensation that would be due such executive under a variety of termination scenarios. d) Amendment of the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and Astoria Financial Corporation Director Retirement Plan. On December 21, 2005, the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Association approved amendments to the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and Astoria Financial Corporation Director Retirement Plan (the "Astoria Plan"). The amendments among other things were designed to resolve certain ambiguities in the Astoria Plan regarding the amount of benefit payable to an eligible director upon retirement and the integration of the Astoria Plan with director retirement plans provided by companies that have merged into the Company or the Association, specifically The Greater New York Savings Bank in 1997 and Long Island Bancorp and Long Island Savings Bank in 1998. Eligible participants in the Astoria Plan include all current directors of the Company except for those directors who are or ever have been an employee of the Company, the Association or any company merged into either of them. This excludes from participation in the Astoria Plan the following directors of the Company: George L. Engelke, Jr. Gerard C. Keegan, John J. Conefry, Jr. and Thomas V. Powderly. In 1999, participation in the Astoria Plan was frozen such that any director who first joins the Board of Directors of the Company or the Association after March 1, 1999 will not be eligible to participate in the Astoria Plan. -4-
Benefits under the Astoria Plan vest at a 50% level once an eligible director completes 10 years of service. Vesting increases by 5% each additional year of service thereafter with 100% vesting after 20 years of service. The Astoria Plan was amended to clarify that for purposes of the Astoria Plan service on the Board of Directors of companies merged into the Company or the Association is counted as eligible service under the Astoria Plan. Any benefit which a director receives pursuant to a retirement plan for service on the Board of Directors of a company merged into the Company or the Association pursuant to a plan established by such merged company acts as an offset against the benefit due the director pursuant to the Astoria Plan. The directors affected by this clarification are Robert J. Conway and Leo J. Waters, each former Long Island Bancorp and Long Island Savings Bank directors and Peter C. Haeffner, Jr., a former director of The Greater New York Savings Bank. The Plan was also amended to clarify the basic benefit payable under the plan and in certain cases to provide benefit payment options. The basic benefit payable under the Astoria Plan is a monthly benefit for the life of a director commencing at retirement from the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Association or age 65, whichever is later, which on an annual basis is equal the sum of (i) the annual retainers paid by the Company and the Association to their directors at the time the director retires, (ii) any annual retainers the director was receiving from the Company and the Association for service as the chairman of a committee of the Boards of Directors of the Company or the Association at the time the director retires, and (iii) a sum equal to the meeting fees paid to the director for committee meeting attendance in the year preceding the director's retirement. Directors, prior to December 31, 2005, will be allowed to elect alternate forms of benefit payment for their benefits under the Astoria Plan. The alternate forms of benefit, in addition to the single life annuity described above, are (i) a 10 year certain annuity, (ii) a joint and survivor annuity with the director's spouse, and (iii) a lump sum payment. The amount of the alternate forms of benefits is calculated to be actuarially equivalent to the basic single life annuity benefit described above. For those directors entitled to receive benefits under director retirement plans established by companies merged into the Company or the Association, the director must select a form of benefit payment under the Astoria Plan that is the same as the form provided pursuant to the plan established by the company merged into the Company or the Association, i.e. a 10 year certain annuity in the case of Messrs. Conway and Waters and a joint and survivor annuity in the case of Mr. Haeffner. If an eligible director dies while in service as a director of the Company or the Association, no benefits are due the director under the Astoria Plan. In the event of a change of control, as defined in the Astoria Plan, eligible directors will receive service credit through the balance of their then current term as a director. Prior to December 31, 2005, eligible directors will be required to elect whether, in the event of a change of control, their benefits due pursuant to the Astoria Plan shall be paid to the director in a lump sum or transferred into a rabbi trust to be established at that time and paid pursuant to the original alternate form benefit election. The directors who are eligible to participate in the Astoria Plan, at this time, have the following vesting percentage: Andrew M. Burger: 100% Denis J. Connors: 75% Robert J. Conway 100% Thomas J. Donahue: 75% Peter C. Haeffner, Jr. 65% Ralph Palleschi 0% Leo J. Waters 75% -5-

The mandatory retirement age for members of the Board of Directors of the Association shall be as set forth in the Bylaws of the Association, as amended from time to time, as in effect on January 1, 1990 or, if later, the date on which the individual became an Eligible Director. 3. The mandatory retirement age for members of the Board of Directors of the Company shall be as set forth in the Bylaws of the Company, as amended from time to time, as in effect on January 1, 2004 or, if later, the date on which the individual became an Eligible Director. 4. For purposes of determining benefits (the "Monthly Benefits") under Paragraph 5 hereof the following definitions shall apply; (a) Full Years of Service shall be the greater of years of service for the Board of Directors of the Association or the Company. Years of Service on the Board of Directors of an Acquired Company shall be recognized as Years of Service with the Association or the Company in the case of any Eligible Director who (i) served on the Board of Directors of an Acquired Company immediately prior to its acquisition by the Association or the Company and (ii) became a member of the Board of Directors of the Association or the Company immediately upon such acquisition. In the event of a Change of Control (as defined below), Years of Service shall be computed as if the Eligible Director's service had continued through May 31st of the calendar year in which the Eligible Director's current term would expire. (b) Monthly Fee for any Eligible Director as of any date shall mean the aggregate of the following: (i) one-twelfth of the annual retainer(s) rate in effect for service as a director of the Boards of Directors of the Association and the Company, (ii) one-twelfth of the annual retainer in effect for service as chairman of a committee of the Boards of Directors of the Association and the Company of which such Eligible Director is chairman; and (iii) one-twelfth of the aggregate per-meeting fees (if any) actually paid to such Eligible Director for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors of the Association and the Company and any committees thereof during the twelve consecutive calendar month period ending with the month that includes the date in question. (c) Acquired Company shall mean Fidelity New York, F.S.B., The Greater New York Savings Bank, Long Island Bancorp, Inc, and The Long Island Savings Bank, FSB.
5. The Monthly Benefit to which an Eligible Director shall be entitled shall be based upon the following vesting schedule: Full Years of Monthly Benefit, calculated by multiplying Service the percentage below by the Monthly Fee -------------- -------------------------------------------- Less than 10 0% 10 50% 11 55% 12 60% 13 65% 14 70% 15 75% 16 80% 17 85% 18 90% 19 95% 20 or more 100% In the case of an Eligible Director who has received or is eligible to receive a benefit under another director retirement plan for service as a director of an Acquired Company, the Monthly Benefit payable under this Plan (when expressed as a single life annuity) shall be reduced by the monthly benefit paid or payable under such other plan (when expressed as a single life annuity payable at the same time as the Monthly Benefit is payable under this Plan). Except as provided below with respect to Monthly Benefits which become payable following a Change of Control (as defined below), the Monthly Benefit shall be paid as follows: (a) Normal Retirement: Monthly Benefits shall be paid monthly commencing on the first day of the month following retirement upon reaching the later of the mandatory retirement ages set forth in the Bylaws of the Company and the Association as in effect on January 1, 2004 and January 1, 1990, respectively, or, if later, the date on which the individual became an Eligible Director. -2-
(b) Early Retirement: Monthly Benefits shall be paid monthly commencing on the later of the first day of the month following retirement or the first day of the month following attainment of age 65. For purposes of the Plan and subject to Paragraph 11, Early Retirement shall include all manner and means by which an Eligible Director ceases to serve as a director of the Company and the Association, excluding only normal retirement, removal for cause or death. 6. The Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan and the Monthly Benefits will be paid as due by the Association from its general assets. 7. In the event that an Eligible Director's service on the Boards of Directors of the Company and the Association ceases as a result of such Eligible Director's disability, the Monthly Benefit to which such Eligible Director would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to the Plan may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Association, be increased to an amount up to 100% of the Monthly Fee received by the Eligible Director and the timing of such payment shall be accelerated to the first day of the calendar month immediately following cessation of service due to disability. Disability for this purpose shall mean any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of at least twelve (12) months and as a result of which either: (a) the Eligible Director is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity or (b) the Eligible Director has been receiving income replacement benefits for a period of at least three (3) months under an accident and health plan covering employees of the Eligible Director's employer, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Association in accordance with section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the regulations thereunder. 8. All benefits payable to an Eligible Director pursuant to the Plan shall terminate with the monthly payment made for the month that includes the date of death of the Eligible Director, unless the Eligible Director elects that benefits be paid in one of the following optional forms: (a) a single lump sum payment (b) fixed monthly installments for 120 months (c) a joint and 100% survivor annuity An election of an optional form of payment shall be in writing in the form and manner determined by the Board of Directors of the Association and must be made prior to the later of (i) commencement of participation in the Plan and (ii) January 1, 2006. An Eligible Director who is also entitled to a benefit under another plan for service as a director of The Long Island Savings Bank, FSB or Long Island Bancorp, Inc. shall be deemed to have elected fixed monthly installments for 120 months. An Eligible Director who is also entitled to a benefit under another plan for service as a director of The Greater New York Savings Bank shall be deemed to have elected a joint and 100% survivor annuity form of payment with his spouse as his contingent annuitant. The amount of any optional form of payment shall be determined by, and on the basis of, reasonable interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by an enrolled actuary selected by the Board of Directors of the Association such that the actuarial present value of the payments made under the optional form of payment are equivalent to the actuarial present value of the payments that would be made in the form of a single life annuity. -3-
Where an Eligible Director elects a form of payment with a guaranteed minimum number of payments, the Eligible Director may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries for any payments remaining to be made at the time of his death by filing a written notice with the Corporate Secretary prior to the Eligible Director's death, in such form and manner as the Corporate Secretary may prescribe. An Eligible Director who has designated a beneficiary or beneficiaries may change or revoke such designation prior to the Eligible Director's death by means of a similar written instrument. Where an Eligible Director elects a joint and survivor annuity form of payment, the Eligible Director may designate a contingent annuitant by filing a written notice with the Corporate Secretary prior to the Eligible Director's death, in such form and manner as the Corporate Secretary may prescribe. An Eligible Director who has designated a contingent annuitant may change or revoke such designation prior to the commencement of payments or the Eligible Director's death (whichever is earlier) by means of a similar written instrument. If no beneficiary shall have been designated or if any such designation shall be ineffective, or in the event that no designated beneficiary survives the Eligible Director, payments due to a beneficiary shall be paid in a single lump sum to the Eligible Director's personal representative, or if no personal representative is appointed within six (6) months after the Eligible Director's death or such longer period as the Board of Directors of the Association deems reasonable in its discretion, to his surviving spouse, or if he has no surviving spouse, to his then living descendants, per stirpes. If any Eligible Director and any one or more of his designated beneficiary(ies) shall die in circumstances that leave substantial doubt as to who shall have been the first to die, the Eligible Director shall be deemed to have survived the deceased Beneficiary(ies). The presence of substantial doubt for such purposes shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Association in its sole and absolute discretion. If the Eligible Director's designated contingent annuitant does not survive him, then no survivor benefit shall be paid under a joint and survivor annuity form of payment. 9. (a) A Change of Control means, with respect to an Eligible Director: (a) a change in ownership of the Eligible Director's Service Recipient; (b) a change in effective control of the Eligible Director's Service Recipient; or (c) a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Eligible Director's Service Recipient. Service Recipient means with respect to an Eligible Director on any date: (i) the corporation for which the Eligible Director is performing services on such date; (ii) all corporations that are liable to the Eligible Director for the benefits due to him under the Plan; (iii) a corporation that is a majority shareholder of a corporation described in section (i) or (ii) above; or (iv) any corporation in a chain of corporations each of which is a majority shareholder of another corporation in the chain, ending in a corporation described in section (i) or (ii) above. The existence of a Change of Control shall be determined by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Committee") in accordance with section 409A of the Code and the regulations thereunder. -4-
(b) In the event of a Change of Control, the Association shall pay: (i) To the Eligible Director, not later than thirty (30) days following the Change of Control or upon the Eligible Director's termination of service as a director of the Company and the Association, whichever is later, a lump sum payment equal to the present value of the Monthly Benefits to which such Eligible Director is then entitled under the Plan, where such present value is determined using the mortality tables prescribed under section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) of the Code and a discount rate, compounded monthly, equal to the annualized rate of interest prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for the valuation of immediate annuities payable under terminating single-employer defined benefit plans (or, if no such rate is prescribed, the rate prescribed under section 417(e)(3) of the Code) for the month in which the Eligible Director's termination of service as a director occurs; or (ii) If elected by the Eligible Director in writing prior to the date of commencement of participation in the Plan or, if later, January 1, 2006, to a trust fund to be established for the benefit of the Eligible Director at the time of the Change of Control, with a trustee selected by the Eligible Director, an amount actuarially determined to be sufficient to pay to the Eligible Director the Monthly Benefit provided pursuant to the Plan as such benefit would be payable to the Eligible Director under the terms of the Plan but for the Change of Control. To the extent of any payment under Paragraph 9(b)(i), the Association shall have no further liability with respect to the payment of benefits to the Eligible Director under the Plan. The Association shall continue to be liable for the payment of benefits under the Plan to the extent of any shortfall in the funds held in trust for the payment of benefits pursuant to Paragraph 9(b)(ii). To the extent that upon the conclusion of the payment from the trust of all benefits due to an Eligible Director under the Plan there is an excess in the funds held in trust for the benefit of the Eligible Director, such excess shall be returned to the Association. (c) The Association shall pay all taxes, trustee's fees and other administrative charges or expenses associated with the establishment or continuance of such trust fund. 10. (a) Whenever appropriate in the Plan, words used in the singular may be read in the plural, words in the plural may be read in the singular, and words importing the masculine gender shall be deemed equally to refer to the feminine or the neuter. Any reference to a Paragraph shall be to a Paragraph of the Plan, unless otherwise indicated. -5-
(b) The right to receive a benefit under the Plan shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation or assignment, nor shall rights be liable for or subject to debts, contracts liabilities or torts. This Plan shall be binding upon the Association and its successors and assigns, including any successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver or other person or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets and business of the Association may be sold or otherwise transferred. (c) The Association shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend its Eligible Directors against their reasonable costs, including legal fees, incurred by them or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which they may be involved, as a result of their efforts, in good faith, to defend or enforce terms of the Plan. (d) A determination that any provision of the Plan is invalid or unenforceable shall not effect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof. (e) Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any terms, covenants or conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant or condition. A waiver of any provision of the Plan must be in writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power hereunder at any one or more times shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times. (f) The Plan shall be construed, administered and enforced according to the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof, except to the extent that such laws are preempted by federal law. The federal and state courts having jurisdiction in Nassau, Suffolk and New York Counties, New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim, action, complaint or lawsuit brought under the terms of the Plan or in any way relating to the rights or obligations of any person under, or the acts or omissions of the Board of Directors of the Company and/or the Association or any duly authorized person acting in their behalf in relation to, the Plan. By accepting participation in this Plan, the Eligible Director, for himself and any other person claiming any rights under the Plan through him, agrees to submit himself, and any such legal action described herein that he shall bring, to the sole jurisdiction of such courts for the adjudication and resolution of such disputes. The filing of any action, suit or proceeding in any other jurisdiction shall result in a forfeiture of all benefits due under the Plan to or in respect of the person making such filing. (g) The Association shall have the right to retain a sufficient portion of any payment made under the Plan to cover the amount required to be withheld pursuant to any applicable federal, state and local tax law. -6-
(h) Nothing in this Plan shall be held or construed to establish any deposit account for any Eligible Director or any deposit liability on the part of the Association. An Eligible Directors' rights hereunder shall be equivalent to those of a general unsecured creditor. (i) The Plan may be amended or terminated at any time by resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company and the Board of Directors of the Association. If the Plan is terminated, no further benefits shall be earned, but benefits earned through the termination date will continue to be paid at the times and in the manner provided under the Plan. (j) The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have the exclusive right to interpret the Plan and to decide any matters arising in connection with the administration and operation of the Plan and to take all other necessary and proper actions to fulfill its duties as administrator. Any action taken or omitted by the Committee with respect to the Plan, including any decision, interpretation, claim denial or review on appeal, shall be conclusive and binding on the Company, the Association and Eligible Directors. The Committee shall not be liable for any actions by it under the Plan, unless due to its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. The Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company and/or the Association from and against all personal liability to which it may be subject by reason of any act done or omitted to be done in its official capacity as administrator in good faith in the administration of the Plan, including all expenses reasonably incurred in its defense in the event the Company and/or the Association fails to provide such defense upon the request of the Committee. The Committee is relieved of all responsibility in connection with its duties hereunder to the fullest extent permitted by law, short of breach of duty. 11. Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, any payments or benefits provided to an Eligible Director pursuant to this Plan by the Association are subject to and conditioned upon compliance with Section 18K of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1825(k), and any regulations promulgated thereunder. 12. The Plan is intended to be a non-qualified deferred compensation plan described in section 409A of the Code. The Plan shall be operated, administered and construed to give effect to such intent. In addition, the Plan shall be subject to amendment, with or without advance notice to Eligible Directors and other interested parties, and on a prospective or retroactive basis, including but not limited to amendment in a manner that adversely affects the rights of Eligible Directors and other interested parties, to the extent necessary to effect such compliance. -7-

Commenting on the Board's action, Mr. Engelke said, "The increase in the cash dividend is evidence of the Board's continued confidence in the fundamental strength of the Company and its commitment to enhancing shareholder value." TENTH STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM COMPLETED; ELEVENTH PROGRAM COMMENCED During the 2005 fourth quarter, Astoria repurchased 2.5 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $28.37 per share. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, 6.6 million shares were repurchased at an average cost of $27.49 per share. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the Company completed its tenth stock repurchase program, purchasing the remaining 262,300 shares available under that plan. The eleventh repurchase program, approved by the Board of Directors on December 21, 2005, authorizing the repurchase of up to ten million shares, commenced in the 2006 first quarter immediately following the completion of the tenth repurchase program. 2
BOARD SETS ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING DATE The Board of Directors, at their January 25, 2006 meeting, established May 17, 2006 as the date for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a voting record date of March 24, 2006. FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR EARNINGS SUMMARY Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 totaled $113.7 million compared to $120.9 million for the same period a year ago. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, net interest income increased to $478.8 million from $470.6 in the comparable 2004 period. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 declined six basis points from the same period a year ago to 2.12%. On a linked quarter basis, the net interest margin decreased eight basis points. The Company's core interest rate spread (the difference between the yield on loans and the cost of deposits) for the 2005 fourth quarter declined eleven basis points on a linked quarter basis to 2.91% and eighteen basis points from the 2004 fourth quarter. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, the net interest margin increased two basis points to 2.19% from 2.17% for the 2004 full year period. Commenting on the net interest margin, Mr. Engelke noted, "Clearly, continuing to reduce the lower yielding securities portfolio and borrowings while growing loans and deposits has helped mitigate margin compression in the current yield curve environment. If the current flat to inverted yield curve persists throughout 2006, we expect that the net interest margin will be somewhat lower but should not decline below an average of 2.00% for the full year." Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 totaled $26.6 million compared to $22.6 million for the 2004 fourth quarter, excluding the $16.5 million other-than-temporary impairment charge. The increase is primarily due to an increase of $2.3 million in customer service fees and $1.3 million of non-recurring other income. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, non-interest income increased to $102.2 million from $96.6 million for the comparable 2004 period, excluding the $16.5 million impairment charge noted above. The increase was primarily due to a $7.7 million, or 13%, increase in customer service fees and a $1.3 million increase in mortgage banking income, net, partially offset by the absence of gains on sales of securities which totaled $4.7 million in 2004. The components of mortgage banking income, net, included in non-interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 4Q05 4Q04 2005 2004 - -------------------------------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Loan servicing fees $ 1.2 $ 1.4 $ 5.0 $ 5.8 Amortization of MSR* (1.2) (1.6) (5.2) (6.8) MSR valuation adjustments 0.1 0.3 2.7 2.2 Net gain on sale of loans 0.8 0.7 3.5 3.5 -------- -------- -------- -------- Mortgage banking income, net $ 0.9 $ 0.8 $ 6.0 $ 4.7 ======== ======== ======== ======== * Mortgage servicing rights General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 declined to $52.7 million from $57.9 million for the 2005 third quarter and $53.4 million for the 2004 fourth quarter. The linked quarter decrease of $5.2 million is primarily due to the $1.9 million of expenses recorded in the 2005 third quarter related to the outsourcing of our mortgage servicing and other company-wide cost saving initiatives, a $1.2 million reduction in ESOP expense in the 2005 fourth quarter related to the annual adjustment of estimated expense to actual, and lower advertising expense in the 2005 fourth quarter. 3
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, G&A totaled $228.7 million compared to $225.0 million for the comparable 2004 period. The Company expects the G&A expense level for 2006 to be at or slightly lower than total G&A expenses for 2005 due to the benefit derived from outsourcing mortgage servicing and other company-wide cost-saving initiatives undertaken in the 2005 third quarter, offset by normal annual salary and other expense increases. BALANCE SHEET SUMMARY Due to the further flattening and inversion of the yield curve during the fourth quarter, spread availability continued to narrow. Accordingly, we continued to reduce our balance sheet through the reduction of non-core business activities. Total securities for the quarter ended December 31, 2005 decreased $516.2 million, or 29% annualized, to $6.6 billion at December 31, 2005, or 29% of total assets, of which $1.8 billion, or 8% of total assets, are categorized as available-for-sale. Borrowings decreased $162.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2005, or 8% annualized, to $7.9 billion at December 31, 2005, representing 35% of total assets. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, total securities decreased $2.1 billion, or 25%, and borrowings decreased $1.5 billion, or 16%. Total assets decreased $250.4 million from September 30, 2005 and $1.0 billion from December 31, 2004 and total $22.4 billion at December 31, 2005. Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow: During the 2005 fourth quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $248.4 million, or 10% annualized, to $9.8 billion at December 31, 2005. Originations and purchases totaled $837.6 million for the 2005 fourth quarter compared to $1.0 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter of which 70% and 73%, respectively, consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $703.2 million, or 8%. One-to-four family loan originations and purchases for 2005 increased to $3.3 billion from $3.2 billion for the comparable 2004 period of which 76% and 73%, respectively, consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans. During the 2005 fourth quarter, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $45.1 million, or 5% annualized, to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2005, or 27% of total loans outstanding. Multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $183.9 million for the 2005 fourth quarter compared to $190.5 million for the comparable 2004 period. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $398.9 million, or 11%. Multifamily and CRE loan originations for 2005 totaled $952.9 million compared to $1.1 billion for 2004. The average loan-to-value ratio of the combined multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million. 4
At December 31, 2005, non-performing loans increased to $65.0 million, or 0.29% of total assets, from $37.9 million, or 0.17% of total assets, at September 30, 2005. We discontinue accruing interest on mortgage loans when such loans become 90 days delinquent as to the interest due, even though in some instances the borrower has only missed two payments. As of December 31, 2005 and September 30, 2005, $28.1 million and $11.2 million, respectively, of loans classified as non-performing had missed just two payments. As of December 31, 2005, 1-4 family non-performing loans totaled $35.7 million and had an average LTV of 65% and multifamily/CRE non-performing loans totaled $28.8 million and had an average LTV of 68% with an average debt coverage ratio of 1.76. On November 30, 2005, the Company completed the outsourcing of its mortgage servicing operations and systems. Typically, with conversions of this magnitude, some disruptions in payment processing and loan collection efforts occur which usually take up to 90 days after outsourcing to return to normal. Net charge-offs for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2005 totaled $888,000 and $1.6 million, respectively, or an annualized rate of two basis points and one basis point, respectively, of average total loans outstanding. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at December 31, 2005 was 125%. Deposits increased $4.8 million from September 30, 2005 and total $12.8 billion at December 31, 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2005, deposits increased $487.2 million, or 4%. These increases are primarily due to increases in medium-term and Liquid CD accounts. During 2005, we have grown our medium-term CD accounts at interest rates significantly below alternative funding sources which, in addition to contributing to the management of interest rate risk, permits us to reduce our borrowing levels and continues to produce new customers from our communities, creating relationship development opportunities. For the year ended December 31, 2005, $4.1 billion of non-Liquid CD accounts were issued or repriced at an average rate of 3.45% and an average maturity of 13 months. Since the introduction of our Liquid CD account in the 2005 first quarter, balances have grown to $619.8 million at December 31, 2005. Core deposits, including Liquid CD accounts, at December 31, 2005 total $5.3 billion, with an average rate of 0.74%. Stockholders' equity was $1.4 billion, or 6.03% of total assets at December 31, 2005. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.53%, 6.53% and 12.53%, respectively, at December 31, 2005. 5
FUTURE OUTLOOK Commenting on the outlook for 2006, Mr. Engelke stated, "We expect the operating environment to remain challenging throughout 2006 as rising short-term interest rates and relatively stable long-term interest rates exert further pressure on the net interest margin. As a result, we expect to continue our strategy of shrinking the balance sheet through a reduction in the securities portfolio and borrowings of approximately $1.5 billion each through normal cash flow, while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve both the quality of the balance sheet and earnings. Overall, these activities should result in a further reduction in the balance sheet of approximately $1 billion, similar to the 2005 reduction, and a continued modest compression of the net interest margin throughout 2006. As we continue to reduce the size of the balance sheet during this challenging interest rate environment, we will continue to focus on the repurchase of our stock as a very desirable use of capital." Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $22.4 billion is the sixth largest thrift institution in the United States. Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $12.8 billion and embraces its philosophy of Putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, www.astoriafederal.com.

ITEMS 2 THROUGH 7  NOT APPLICABLE.
Item 1.01     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
          The Boards of Directors of Astoria Financial Corporation, the Company and Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, the Association,  at their meetings held on April 19, 2006 adopted an amendment to the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and Astoria Financial Corporation Directors' Retirement Plan, the Plan, in order to clarify that in the event a director who has a vested benefit under the Plan were to die will serving as a director of the Company or the Association, such director's beneficiary would not forfeit the director's vested benefit, unless the director had selected, prior to January 1, 2006, to receive his benefit under the Plan as a single life annuity. No director of the Company or Association who is eligible to receive a benefit under the plan selected a single life annuity benefit option.
          A copy of the Plan as amended is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1. The description set forth above is subject in its entirety to the terms and conditions set forth in the Plan.
Item 8.01     Other Events.
          The Board of Directors of the Association at its meeting held on April 19, 2006 amended Article III, Section 2 of the Bylaws of the Association to reduce the size of the Board of Directors of the Association from eleven directors to ten. This action, which was effective immediately, is subject to a 30 day review and non-objection by the Office of Thrift Supervision. This action eliminates the directorship which was vacated by the resignation on March 14, 2006 of Robert J. Conway as a director of the Company and the Association.
          The Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting on March 15, 2006 by resolution, previously took the actions necessary to reduce the size of the Board of Directors of the Company to ten directors and eliminate the vacancy created by Mr. Conway's resignation.
          A copy of the Bylaws of the Association, as amended, is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1
The Company also reported that on April 18, 2006, Standard & Poor's ("S&P")  raised its long-term counterparty credit rating on Astoria Financial Corporation to BBB' from BBB-' and its long-term counterparty rating on the Company's subsidiary bank, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association to BBB+' from BBB'.  The outlook is stable.

          . All annual and special meetings of shareholders shall be held at the administrative office of the ASSOCIATION located at One Astoria Federal Plaza, Lake Success, New York or at such other place in the State in which the principal place of business of the ASSOCIATION is located as the board of directors may determine.

          . For a period of five years from the date of the completion of the conversion of the ASSOCIATION from mutual to stock form, special meetings of the shareholders relating to a change in control of the ASSOCIATION or to an amendment of the Charter of the ASSOCIATION may be called only by the board of directors. Thereafter, special meetings of the shareholders for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by the regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"), may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the president, or a majority of the board of directors, and shall be called by the chairman of the board, the president or the secretary upon the written request of the holders of not less than one-tenth of all the outstanding capital stock of the ASSOCIATION entitled to vote at the meeting. Such written request shall state the purpose or purposes of the meeting and shall be delivered at the home office of the ASSOCIATION addressed to the chairman of the board, the president or the secretary.
Section 3. Special Meetings
          . Annual and special meetings shall be conducted in accordance with the most current edition of Robert's Rules of Order unless otherwise prescribed by regulations of the OTS or these bylaws. The board of directors shall designate, when present, either the chairman of the board or president to preside at such meetings.
Section 4. Conduct of Meetings
          . Written notice stating the place, day and hour of the meeting and the purpose(s) for which the meeting is called shall be delivered not fewer than 20 nor more than 50 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the chairman of the board, the president, the secretary, or the directors calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address as it appears on the stock transfer books or records of the ASSOCIATION as of the record date prescribed in Section 6 of this Article II, with postage prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case of an original meeting. It shall not be necessary to give any notice of the time and place of any meeting adjourned for less than 30 days or of the business to be transacted at the meeting, other than an announcement at the meeting at which such adjournment is taken.
Section 5. Notice of Meetings
          . For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors shall fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case shall be not more than 60 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not fewer than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment.
Section 6. Fixing of Record Date
          . At least 20 days before each meeting of the shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for shares of the ASSOCIATION shall make a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournment, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders shall be kept on file at the home office of the ASSOCIATION and shall be subject to inspection by any shareholder at any time during usual business hours, for a period of 20 days prior to such meeting. Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection by any shareholder during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer book shall constitute prima facie evidence of the shareholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of shareholders.
Section 7. Voting Lists
          In lieu of making the shareholder list available for inspection by shareholders as provided in the preceding paragraph, the board of directors may elect to follow the procedures prescribed in 552.6(d) of the OTS's Regulations as now or hereafter in effect.
          . A majority of the outstanding shares of the ASSOCIATION entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. If less than a majority of the outstanding shares is represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to constitute less than a quorum.
Section 8. Quorum
          . At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly authorized attorney in fact. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board of directors. No proxy shall be valid more than eleven months from the date of its execution except for a prosy coupled with an interest.
Section 9. Proxies
          . When ownership stands in the name of two or more persons, in the absence of written directions to the ASSOCIATION to the contrary, at any meeting of the shareholders of the ASSOCIATION any one or more of such shareholders may cast, in person or by proxy, all votes to which such ownership is entitled. In the event an attempt is made to cast conflicting votes, in person or by proxy, by the several persons in whose names shares of stock stand, the vote or votes to which those persons are entitled shall be cast as directed by a majority of those holding such and present in person or by proxy at such meeting, but no votes shall be cast for such stock if a majority cannot agree.
Section 10. Voting of Shares in the Name of Two or More Persons
          . Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by any officer, agent or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine. Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him without a transfer of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer into his name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court or other public authority by which such receiver was appointed.
Section 11. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders
          A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee and thereafter the pledgee, shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.
          Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the ASSOCIATION, nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the ASSOCIATION, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.
          . Shareholders shall not be entitled to cumulate their votes for election of directors.
Section 12. Cumulative Voting
          . In advance of any meeting of shareholders, the board of directors may appoint any persons other than nominees for office as inspectors of election to act at such meeting or any adjournment. The number of inspectors shall be either one or three. Any such appointment shall not be altered at the meeting. If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the chairman of the board or the president may, or on the request of not fewer than 10 percent of the votes represented at the meeting shall, make such appointment at the meeting. If appointed at the meeting, the majority of the votes present shall determine whether one or three inspectors are to be appointed. In case any person appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment by the board of directors in advance of the meeting, or at the meeting by the chairman of the board or the president.
Section 13. Inspectors of Election
          Unless otherwise prescribed by regulations of the OTS, the duties of such inspectors shall include: determining the number of shares and the voting power of each share, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies; receiving votes, ballots, or consents; hearing and determining all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the rights to vote; counting and tabulating all votes or consents; determining the result; and such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.
          . The board of directors shall act as a nominating committee for selecting the nominees for election as directors. Except in the case of a nominee substituted as a result of the death or other incapacity of a nominee, the nominating committee shall deliver written nominations to the secretary at least 20 days prior to the date of the annual meeting. Upon delivery, such nominations shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each office of the ASSOCIATION. No nominations for directors except those made by the nominating committee shall be voted upon at the annual meeting unless other nominations by shareholders are made in writing and delivered to the secretary of the ASSOCIATION at least five days prior to the date of the annual meeting. Upon delivery, such nominations shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each office of the ASSOCIATION. Ballots bearing the names of all persons nominated by the nominating committee and by shareholders shall be provided for use at the annual meeting. However, if the nominating committee shall fail or refuse to act at least 20 days prior to the annual meeting, nominations for directors may be made at the annual meeting by any shareholder entitled to vote and shall be voted upon.
Section 14. Nominating Committee
          . Any new business to be taken up at the annual meeting shall be stated in writing and filed with the secretary of the ASSOCIATION at least five days before the date of the annual meeting, and all business so stated, proposed, and filed shall be considered at the annual meeting, but no other proposal shall be acted upon at the annual meeting. Any shareholder may make any other proposal at the annual meeting and the same may be discussed and considered, but unless stated in writing and filed with the secretary at least five days before the meeting, such proposal shall be laid over for action at an adjourned, special, or annual meeting of the shareholders taking place 30 days or more thereafter. This provision shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at the annual meeting of reports of officers, directors and committees; but in connection with such reports no new business shall be acted upon at such annual meeting unless stated and filed as herein provided.
Section 15. New Business
          . Any action required to be taken at a meeting of shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be given by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.
Section 16. Informal Action by Shareholders
          .  The business and affairs of the ASSOCIATION shall be under the direction of its board of directors. The board of directors shall annually elect a chairman of the board and a president from among its members and shall designate, when present, either the chairman of the board or the president to preside at its meetings.
Section 1. General Powers
          . The board of directors shall consist of ten members and shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible. The members of each class shall be elected for a term of three years and until their successors are elected and qualified. One class shall be elected by ballot annually.
Section 2. Number and Term
          . A regular meeting of the board of directors shall be held without other notice than this bylaw immediately after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders. The board of directors may provide, by resolution, the time and place, within the ASSOCIATION's normal lending territory, for the holding of additional regular meetings without other notice than such resolution.
Section 3. Regular Meetings
          . Each director shall at all times be the beneficial owner of not less than 100 shares of capital stock of the ASSOCIATION unless the ASSOCIATION is a wholly owned subsidiary of a holding company.
Section 4. Qualification
          . Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by or at the request of the chairman of the board, the president or one-third of the directors. The persons authorized to call special meetings of the board of directors may fix any place, within the ASSOCIATION's normal lending territory, as the place for holding any special meeting of the board of directors called by such persons.
Section 5. Special Meetings
          Members of the board of directors may participate in special meetings by means of conference telephone, or by means of similar communications equipment by which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other. Such participation shall constitute presence in person but shall not constitute attendance for the purpose of compensation pursuant to Section 12 of this Article.
          . Written notice of any special meeting shall be given to each director at least two days prior thereto when delivered personally or by telegram, or at least five days prior thereto when delivered by mail at the address at which the director is most likely to be reached. Such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail so addressed, with postage prepaid if mailed, or when delivered to the telegraph company if sent by telegram. Any director may waive notice of any meeting by a writing filed with the secretary. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the board of directors need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.
Section 6. Notice
          . A majority of the number of directors fixed by Section 2 of this Article III shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors, but if less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time. Notice of any adjourned meeting shall be given in the same manner as prescribed by Section 6 of this Article III.
Section 7. Quorum
          . The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the board of directors, unless a greater number is prescribed by regulation of the OTS or by these bylaws.
Section 8. Manner of Acting
          . Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all of the directors.
Section 9. Action Without a Meeting
          . Any director may resign at any time by sending a written notice of such resignation to the home office of the ASSOCIATION addressed to the chairman of the board or president. Unless otherwise specified such resignation shall take effect upon receipt by the chairman of the board or president. More than three consecutive absences from regular meetings of the board of directors, unless excused by resolution of the board of directors, shall automatically constitute a resignation, effective when such resignation is accepted by the board of directors.
Section 10. Resignation
          . Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, although less than a quorum of the board of directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected to serve until the next election of directors by the shareholders.  Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.
Section 11. Vacancies
          . Directors, as such, may receive a stated salary for their services. By resolution of the board of directors, a reasonable fixed sum, and reasonable expenses of attendance, if any, may be allowed for actual attendance at each regular or special meeting of the board of directors. Members of either standing or special committees may be allowed such compensation for actual attendance at committee meetings as the board of directors may determine.
Section 12. Compensation
          . A director of the ASSOCIATION who is present at a meeting of the board of directors at which action on any ASSOCIATION matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his dissent or abstention shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless he shall file a written dissent to such action with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall forward such dissent by registered mail to the secretary of the ASSOCIATION within five days after the date a copy of the minutes of the meeting is received. Such right to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.
Section 13. Presumption of Assent
          . At a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose, any director may be removed for cause by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.

Item 2.02.          Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
          On April 20, 2006, Astoria Financial Corporation ("Astoria") issued a press release which, among other things, highlights the Company's financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2006.  A copy of  the press release is included herewith as an exhibit to this report.
          The information provided pursuant hereto shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Form 8-K into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.
Item 9.01.          Financial Statements and Exhibits.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
          LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., April 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $48.9 million, or $0.49 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, compared to $59.5 million, or $0.57 EPS, for the 2005 first quarter.  Included in the 2006 first quarter results is a $5.5 million ($3.6 million after-tax), or $0.04 per diluted share, charge associated with the termination of interest rate swap agreements.
           For the quarter ended March 31, 2006, returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 14.77%, 17.17% and 0.88%, respectively, compared to 17.42%, 20.15% and 1.02%, respectively, for the comparable 2005 period.  Excluding the charge for terminating the interest rate swap agreements, the returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 15.86%, 18.44% and 0.95% for the quarter ended March 31, 2006.
          2006 First Quarter Financial Highlights:
          Commenting on the first quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "While the interest rate environment remained very challenging throughout the first quarter, with rising interest rates and the continuation of a flat yield curve exerting downward pressure on the net interest margin, our strategy of reducing securities and borrowings while increasing loans and deposits limited the decline in the margin."
          Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.24 Per Share
          The Board of Directors of the Company, at their April 19, 2006 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share.  The dividend is payable on June 1, 2006 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2006.  This is the forty-fourth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
          Eleventh Stock Repurchase Program Continues
          During the first quarter, Astoria completed its tenth stock repurchase program and commenced its eleventh stock repurchase program, repurchasing 2.5 million shares at an average cost of $29.27 per share.
          First Quarter 2006 Earnings Summary
          Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 totaled $111.5 million compared to $113.7 million for the 2005 fourth quarter and $125.2 million for the 2005 first quarter.
          Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 decreased just two basis points on a linked quarter basis and fourteen basis points from the comparable period a year ago to 2.10%, primarily due to the cost of liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on earning assets.  The Company's core interest rate spread (the difference between the yield on loans and the cost of deposits) for the 2006 first quarter declined seven basis points on a linked quarter basis and 31 basis points from the comparable period a year ago to 2.84%.
          Commenting on the net interest margin, Mr. Engelke noted, "If the yield curve remains flat, as we anticipate it will, we expect modest margin compression to continue throughout 2006 and the margin declining to an average of slightly below 2% for the full year."
          Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 totaled $18.9 million compared to $24.7 million for the 2005 first quarter.  The decrease is due primarily to the $5.5 million, pre-tax, charge incurred for the termination of the aforementioned interest rate swap agreements and lower mortgage banking income, net, partially offset by an 11%, or $1.7 million, increase in customer service fees.
          The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non- interest income, are detailed below:
          General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 decreased to $56.3 million from $60.5 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The decrease is primarily due to a $2.0 million decrease in advertising expense and a $2.5 million decrease in goodwill litigation expense. Compensation and benefits expense declined to $30.3 million for the 2006 first quarter from $30.8 million for the 2005 first quarter, despite a $1.2 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to the implementation of accounting pronouncement SFAS 123R in the 2006 first quarter.
          Balance Sheet Summary
          Due to the continued flat yield curve environment and lower spread availability, we continued to reduce non-core business activities during the 2006 first quarter.  Total securities declined $345.1 million, or 21% annualized, to $6.2 billion, representing 28% of total assets at March 31, 2006.  Borrowings also declined in the first quarter by $343.1 million, or 17% annualized, to $7.6 billion, representing 34% of total assets at March 31, 2006.  Total assets declined $142.3 million from December 31, 2005 to $22.2 billion at March 31, 2006.
          Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
          During the 2006 first quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $88.6 million, or 4% annualized, and totaled $9.8 billion at March 31, 2006.  1-4 family loan originations and purchases totaled $522.0 million for the 2006 first quarter compared to $726.8 million in the year-ago first quarter.  Of the 2006 first quarter production, 78% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage loans.
          During the 2006 first quarter, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $111.9 million, or 11% annualized, to $4.0 billion at March 31, 2006.  Multifamily/CRE loan originations totaled $217.4 million for the 2006 first quarter compared to $256.6 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The average loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio of the combined multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million.
          At March 31, 2006, non-performing loans declined to $50.0 million, or 0.23% of total assets, from $65.0 million, or 0.29% of total assets, at December 31, 2005.  As of March 31, 2006, 1-4 family non-performing loans totaled $34.0 million and had an average LTV of 64% (based on current principal balance and original appraised value) and multifamily/CRE non- performing loans totaled $15.6 million and had an average LTV of 69% (based on current principal balance and original appraised value).    
           Net charge-offs for the 2006 first quarter totaled just $16,000, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of the average total loans outstanding.  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at March 31, 2006 was 162%.
          Deposits for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 increased $178.5 million, or 6% on an annualized basis, to $13.0 billion from $12.8 billion at December 31, 2005.  This increase was primarily due to increases in medium-term CD and Liquid CD accounts.  During the 2006 first quarter, the CDs that were issued or repriced that had a maturity of twelve months or longer totaled $564.7 million and had an average rate of 4.58 % and an average maturity of 18 months, significantly below alternative funding costs.  During the twelve month period ended March 31, 2006, the CDs that were issued or repriced that had a maturity of twelve months or longer totaled $1.6 billion and had an average rate of 4.07 % and an average maturity of 22 months, also significantly below alternative funding costs.  In addition, since the introduction of our Liquid CD account in the 2005 first quarter, balances have grown to $843.1 million at March 31, 2006.  Core deposits, which exclude non- Liquid CD accounts, total $5.4 billion at March 31, 2006, with an average rate of 0.84% for the quarter.
          Stockholders' equity was $1.3 billion, or 5.89% of total assets, at March 31, 2006.  Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.19%, 6.19% and 11.75 %, respectively, at March 31, 2006.
          Future Outlook
          Commenting on the outlook for the balance of 2006, Mr. Engelke stated, "We expect the operating environment to remain challenging as rising interest rates, coupled with a flat to inverted yield curve, exert further pressure on the net interest margin.  As a result, we expect to continue our strategy of shrinking the balance sheet through reductions in the securities portfolio and borrowings of between $750 million and $1.0 billion each through normal cash flow, while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve both the quality of the balance sheet and earnings.  Overall, these activities should result in a further reduction in the balance sheet of between $500 million and $750 million, and a continued modest compression of the net interest margin throughout the year.  As we continue to reduce the size of the balance sheet, we will continue to focus on the repurchase of our stock as a very desirable use of capital.  This strategy should better position us to take advantage of more profitable asset growth opportunities when the yield curve steepens."
          Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $22.2 billion is the sixth largest thrift institution in the United States.   Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $13.0 billion and embraces its philosophy of Putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, http://www.astoriafederal.com.

None of the amendments to the Code were substantive in nature.  A copy of the Code, as amended, is posted on the Corporation's Investor Relations website at http://ir.astoriafederal.com under the heading "Corporate Governance". For more detailed information concerning the Code, as amended, reference is made to the Astoria Financial Corporation Code of Business Conduct and Ethics filed as Exhibit 14.1 herein.
Item 8.01.          Other Events.
          On May 17, 2006 the Company issued a press release, a copy of which is included herein as exhibit 99.1, announcing the voting results of its Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 17, 2006.  At the meeting, shareholders overwhelmingly voted to re-elect directors, Gerard C. Keegan, Andrew M. Burger, Denis J. Connors and Thomas J. Donahue.  It further announced that shareholders ratified the appointment of its independent registered public accounting firm for the 2006 fiscal year.
Item 9.01.          Financial Statements and Exhibits.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 14.1
          Astoria Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, have always followed the highest principles of business ethics in their dealings with Employees, customers, other persons with whom we do business and the general public. That is the reputation we now enjoy. It is the reputation we intend to keep.
          To maintain this standard, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board of Directors has adopted this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics formalizes the principles by which we have conducted business for many years. It is addressed to all Directors, Officers and Employees of Astoria Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. All such persons must certify that they have read this statement, understand our policies and their responsibilities concerning business conduct and are expected to conform to the requirements of this Code. Difficulties can generally be minimized or avoided entirely if individuals seek the assistance of the Director of Human Resources at the outset of a problem or concern.
          No Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can replace the "thoughtful behavior of an ethical director, officer or employee." It can, however, focus our attention on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to our personnel, provide a mechanism to report unethical behavior and further our culture of honesty and integrity. By reading this policy carefully and understanding and following its directives, we are confident that Astoria can maintain its valued reputation for the highest standards of business ethics.
1
          As used throughout this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the term "Astoria" refers to Astoria Financial Corporation and all of its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and its subsidiaries.
I.          
General Statement
Astoria Financial Corporation's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") can be summarized as follows: Directors, Officers and Employees are all expected to act with the utmost integrity. No Director, Officer, or Employee is to personally gain, either directly or indirectly, from the initiation of any transaction involving Astoria Financial Corporation ( "Astoria"). All Directors, Officers and Employees are expected to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest. All Directors, Officers and Employees owe Astoria a duty of loyalty. This means that the well being of Astoria, and not the personal gain of the individual Director, Officer or Employee, must be utmost in our minds in connection with all business transactions.
We will treat others, whether they be customers, shareholders, other Directors, Officers or Employees, or members of the public in a professional, businesslike manner, with respect and courtesy. Our Directors, Officers and Employees shall deal fairly with our customers, suppliers, competitors and each other. No Director, Officer or Employee shall take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged, confidential or proprietary information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.
Maintaining our high level of ethics and integrity dictates that we do not accept customers or suppliers who are themselves unethical. If we have doubts about the standards of an individual, we will decline to do business with that individual rather than risk damage to our reputation.
Astoria's business is to be conducted in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and the policies contained in this Code. It is the affirmative obligation of each Director, Officer and Employee to report any suspected violations of this Code to the Director of Human Resources, unless otherwise specified in this Code. No retaliatory action will be taken against any Director, Officer or Employee as a result of their good faith reporting of suspected violations of this Code, unless they themselves have violated this Code.
II.        
Definitions
 
IV.          
Dealing with Astoria or Assets of Astoria
All Directors, Officers and Employees are expected to protect Astoria's property, both tangible and intangible, including without limitation, products, services, customer contacts, information, furnishings, equipment and supplies, and to ensure their efficient use.
The misuse or removal of Astoria's property from its facilities is prohibited, unless specifically authorized. This applies equally to property, such as furnishings, equipment and supplies, as well as to property created, obtained or reproduced by Astoria for its exclusive use such as client lists, files, reference materials and reports, computer software, data processing systems, and data bases. Neither originals nor copies may be removed from Astoria's premises or used for purposes other than Astoria business without Astoria's authorization. The integrity of the computer programs and data that comprise the information assets of Astoria must not be compromised. Care must be exercised to protect against intentional or unintentional corruption. Theft, carelessness or waste of Astoria's property shall not be permitted.
Astoria's products and services are its property, and the contributions a Director, Officer or Employee makes to their development and implementation while employed by Astoria are Astoria's property and remain its property even after the Director, Officer or Employee leaves Astoria.
Astoria shall not, directly or indirectly, purchase or lease from, jointly own with, or sell or lease to, a Director, Officer, or Affiliated Person any interest in real or personal property, unless:
As a matter of policy, such transactions are to be discouraged.
This policy also covers the following additional business dealings:
Astoria shall not, either directly or indirectly, invest in or purchase the stock or other securities of an Officer, Director or other Affiliated Person.
Astoria shall not invest in real estate in which a Director, Officer or Affiliated Person has an equity interest. Any other authorized real estate related business dealings involving a Director, Officer or Affiliated Person and Astoria must:
Astoria must maintain centralized records in a form and manner that will enable easy, independent review of all business dealings with Directors, Officers or other Affiliated Persons. These records shall contain:
Astoria Federal shall not maintain a deposit relationship with any Affiliated Person or with any financial institution or holding company thereof of which an Affiliated Person is a director, if the maintenance of such a deposit relationship has been specifically disapproved by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Directors, Officers and Affiliated Persons may have money on deposit with Astoria on terms and conditions generally available to Employees of Astoria.
V.          
Proper Accounting
Adherence to and consistent application of proper and generally accepted accounting principles, policies, rules and internal controls is expected at all times. Complete and accurate data must be provided and maintained in a timely manner so that accounts reflect the true substance of transactions and the financial position of Astoria and the results of Astoria's operations. An Officer or Employee who knows or suspects that false or misleading entries have been made in the records of Astoria or that entries have not been made in such records which should have been made shall inform his or her senior officer or the Director of Human Resources.
No Officer or Employee should permit the existence of a "slush fund" or any other fund not properly recorded on Astoria's books, from which unrecorded disbursements may be made. The law requires that all Astoria assets be properly accounted for, and all payments and receipts by Astoria be appropriately recorded.
Astoria's executive management shall be fully informed at all times of matters that might be considered sensitive. Accordingly, there shall be full communication with executive management and their designees even when it might appear to an Officer or Employee that less candor is desirable to protect Astoria or to make the management group look good. Moreover, there shall be no concealment of information in dealing with the Astoria's independent and internal auditors, examiners/regulators or legal counsel.
VI.          
Compliance with Other Laws
Bribery is the giving of money or anything else of value in an attempt to unlawfully influence the action of a public official. No Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person shall pay, offer or authorize any bribe or make any other unlawful payment on behalf of Astoria no matter how small the amount. This prohibition extends to payments to consultants, agents and other intermediaries when the Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person has some reason to believe that some part of the payment or "fee" will be used to bribe or otherwise improperly influence governmental action. It is a violation of Federal law if a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person, among other things, solicits or demands for the benefit of any person, or accepts or agrees to accept, anything of value from any person, intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business or transaction of Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. By policy, this Code extends this prohibition to any business or transaction of Astoria.
Any gift which is prohibited under this Code must be refused or returned by a Director, Officer or Employee to whom it is offered or by whom it is received. The Director, Officer or Employee should take the opportunity to tactfully, but clearly, communicate Astoria's policy prohibiting its Directors, Officers or Employees from accepting such gifts from customers or suppliers. All such offers and returns of such gifts, excluding those relating to Directors or Executive Officers, must be reported in writing to your Department or Division Head and the Director of Human Resources. All such offers and returns of such gifts involving Executive Officers, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, shall be reported to the Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Human Resources. All such offers and returns of such gifts involving the Directors or the Chief Executive Officer shall be reported to the Compensation Committee and the General Counsel.
If a gift is received which is improper, but which is impractical or awkward to return, the gift should be reported to the Director of Human Resources, who will direct that the gift will be donated, without tax deduction, to a charitable organization selected by Astoria. The supplier or customer that presented the gift will be notified of the donation.
It is important to note that the above rules apply even though a Director, Officer or Employee actually receives the thing of value after terminating service or employment with Astoria.
There are a number of instances where a Director, an Officer or Employee without risk of corruption or breach of trust, may accept things of value from someone doing or seeking to do business with the Association. Examples of activities which violate this Code or would be acceptable conduct are outlined below.
The following are examples of conduct that violate this Code:
On the other hand, a Director, Officer or Employee of Astoria may:
Federal law and our internal policies requires Astoria to conduct its affairs in conformity with federal and applicable state statutes, laws, rules and regulations, including the regulations promulgated by the applicable Federal banking agencies. Astoria is further required to maintain complete and accurate records, and to periodically report on its condition to the applicable regulators.
It is Astoria's policy to obey both foreign and domestic tax laws and foreign exchange control laws. No Director, Officer or Employee shall on behalf of Astoria enter into any transaction that such individual knows or reasonably should know would violate such laws.
Neither Astoria nor its Directors, Officers or Employees should assist any third party in violating the laws of any country. This policy applies whether or not the Astoria's assistance itself violates the laws of any country.
Federal law prohibits Astoria from disclosing information regarding its customers except in limited circumstances and requires Astoria to maintain security measures to safeguard such information. No Director, Officer or Employee may use or disclose customer information except as permitted by Astoria's Privacy Policy and Information Security Policy.

ITEMS 1, 3 THROUGH 8  NOT APPLICABLE.
          On July 20, 2006, Astoria Financial Corporation ("Astoria") issued a press release which, among other things, highlights the Company's financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2006.  A copy of  the press release is included herewith as an exhibit to this report.
          
The information provided pursuant hereto shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Form 8-K into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.
(d)     Exhibits.
          Exhibit 99.1  Press release dated July 20, 2006.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
          LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $47.8 million, or $0.49 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, compared to $57.4 million, or $0.55 EPS, for the 2005 second quarter.  For the 2006 second quarter, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 14.94%, 17.48% and 0.87%, respectively, compared to 16.66%, 19.24% and 1.00%, respectively, for the comparable 2005 period.
          For the six months ended June 30, 2006, net income totaled $96.7 million, or $0.98 EPS, compared to $116.9 million, or $1.12 EPS, for the comparable 2005 period.  For the six months ended June 30, 2006, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 14.87%, 17.34% and 0.87%, respectively, compared to 17.02%, 19.68% and 1.01%, respectively, for the comparable 2005 period.
          Commenting on the 2006 second quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "The effect of seventeen interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve over the past two years has resulted in a prolonged flat to inverted yield curve environment which, in addition to putting pressure on our net interest margin and earnings, continues to limit profitable growth opportunities.  While we have been somewhat successful in mitigating the negative impact on our margin through reductions of our securities and borrowings, a sustained flat to inverted yield curve will continue to exert downward pressure on our margin and earnings.  During this challenging period we will continue our strategy of shrinking the balance sheet by reducing the securities portfolio and borrowings, growing loans and deposits and repurchasing our stock." 
          Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.24 Per Share
          The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 19, 2006 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share.  The dividend is payable on September 1, 2006 to shareholders of record as of August 15, 2006. This is the forty-fifth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. 
          Eleventh Stock Repurchase Program Continues
          During the second quarter, Astoria repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $30.58 per share.  During the six month period ended June 30, 2006 Astoria repurchased a total of 4.7 million shares, completing its tenth stock repurchase program and commencing its eleventh stock repurchase program in the first quarter.  Under the current stock repurchase program, 5.6 million shares of the 10 million shares authorized remain available for repurchase. 
          Second Quarter and Six Month Earnings Summary
          Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 totaled $101.3 million compared to $111.5 million for the 2006 first quarter and $121.3 million for the second quarter a year ago.  For the six months ended June 30, 2006, net interest income totaled $212.9 million compared to $246.6 million for the comparable 2005 six month period.
          Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 declined to 1.92% from 2.10% for the previous quarter and 2.21% for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, primarily due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.  The Company's core interest rate spread (the difference between the yield on loans and the cost of deposits) for the 2006 second quarter declined to 2.63% from 2.84% for the 2006 first quarter and 3.09% for the second quarter a year ago.
          Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 increased $3.2 million to $25.7 million from $22.5 million for the 2005 second quarter.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in mortgage banking income, net, primarily due to a $1.3 million recovery in the mortgage servicing rights ("MSR") valuation allowance in the 2006 second quarter compared to a $2.5 million MSR impairment charge in the 2005 second quarter.
          For the six months ended June 30, 2006, non-interest income totaled $44.6 million compared to $47.3 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The decline was primarily due to a $5.5 million, pre-tax, charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements in the 2006 first quarter, partially offset by increases in mortgage banking income, net, of $2.2 million and customer service and other loan fees of $1.3 million.
          The components of mortgage banking income (loss), net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below:
          General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 declined $2.4 million to $55.2 million from $57.6 million for the comparable 2005 period due primarily to lower compensation and benefit expenses and lower goodwill litigation expense (included in other G&A expense).  On a linked quarter basis, G&A declined $1.1 million, primarily due to reduced pension and incentive compensation accruals.
          For the six months ended June 30, 2006, G&A declined $6.6 million to $111.5 million from $118.1 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The decrease was primarily due to a $4.3 million decrease in goodwill litigation expense, a $1.9 million decrease in advertising expense, a $1.9 million decrease in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in occupancy, equipment and systems expense. 
          Balance Sheet Summary
          Due to the continued flat to inverted yield curve during the second quarter, spread availability continued to narrow.  Accordingly, we continued to reduce our balance sheet through the reduction of non-core business activities.  Total securities for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 declined $356.5 million, or 23% annualized, to $5.9 billion at June 30, 2006, representing 27% of total assets, of which $1.6 billion, or 8% of total assets, are categorized as available-for-sale.  Borrowings declined in the second quarter of 2006 by $391.8 million, or 21% annualized, to $7.2 billion at June 30, 2006, representing 33% of total assets.
          For the six months ended June 30, 2006 total securities declined $701.6 million, or 21% annualized, and borrowings declined $734.9 million, or 19% annualized.  Total assets declined $376.5 million from March 31, 2006 and $518.8 million from December 31, 2005 and total $21.9 billion at June 30, 2006.
          Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
          The following table illustrates this improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
          During the 2006 second quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio decreased slightly and totaled $9.8 billion at June 30, 2006.  For the quarter ended June 30, 2006, 1-4 family loan originations and purchases totaled $554.3 million compared to $707.1 million for the 2005 second quarter.  Of the 2006 second quarter production, 78% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage loans.
          For the six months ended June 30, 2006, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $66.1 million.  For the six month period ended June 30, 2006, 1-4 family loan originations and purchases totaled $1.1 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the year-ago six month period.
          During the 2006 second quarter, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $72.5 million, or 7% annualized, to $4.1 billion, or 28% of total loans, at June 30, 2006.  Multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $183.7 million for the 2006 second quarter compared to $241.9 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million.
          For the six month period ended June 30, 2006, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $184.4 million, or 9% annualized.  Multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $401.1 million for the 2006 six month period compared to $498.5 million in the year-ago six month period.
          At June 30, 2006, non-performing loans totaled $54.3 million, or 0.25% of total assets, compared to $50.0 million, or 0.23% of total assets, at March 31, 2006.  Net charge-offs for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2006 totaled $80,000 and $96,000, respectively, or an annualized rate of less than one basis point of the average total loans outstanding for each period.  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at June 30, 2006 was 149%.
          Deposits for the second quarter increased $103.3 million to $13.1 billion at June 30, 2006, primarily due to an increase in Liquid CD accounts, which increased core deposits $101.2 million to $5.5 billion with an average cost of 1.05%.  During the 2006 second quarter, our efforts to extend deposit liabilities resulted in $1.8 billion of non-Liquid CDs issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 4.83% with a weighted average maturity of 13 months.
          For the six months ended June 30, 2006, deposits increased $281.8 million, or 4% annualized, due primarily to an increase in core deposits, primarily Liquid CD accounts.  In addition, for the six months ended June 30, 2006, $3.2 billion of non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 4.65% with a weighted average maturity of 12 months.
          Stockholders' equity was $1.3 billion, or 5.80% of total assets at June 30, 2006.  Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.53%, 6.53% and 12.22%, respectively, at June 30, 2006. 
          Future Outlook
          Commenting on the outlook for the second half of 2006, Mr. Engelke stated, "The operating environment continues to remain challenging as a result of rising short term interest rates and a continued flat to inverted yield curve which will result in a slightly lower net interest margin for the year than previously forecast.  We expect to continue our strategy of shrinking the balance sheet through reductions in the securities portfolio and borrowings through normal cash flow, while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve the quality of both the balance sheet and earnings.  As we reduce the size of the balance sheet, we will continue to focus on the repurchase of our stock as a very desirable use of capital.  This strategy should better position us to take advantage of more profitable asset growth opportunities when the yield curve steepens."

          On October 19, 2006, Astoria Financial Corporation ("Astoria") issued a press release which, among other things, highlights the Company's financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006.  A copy of the press release is included herewith as an exhibit to this report.
          The information provided pursuant hereto shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Form 8-K into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.

(d)          Exhibits.
              Exhibit 99.1     Press release dated October 19, 2006.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
          LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $41.1 million, or $0.43 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, compared to $59.2 million, or $0.57 EPS, for the 2005 third quarter.  For the 2006 third quarter, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 13.06%, 15.31% and 0.76%, respectively, compared to 17.09%, 19.73% and 1.05%, respectively, for the comparable 2005 period.
          For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, net income totaled $137.8 million, or $1.40 EPS, compared to $176.1 million, or $1.69 EPS, for the comparable 2005 period.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 14.27%, 16.67% and 0.84%, respectively, compared to 17.06%, 19.71% and 1.02%, respectively, for the comparable 2005 period.
          Commenting on the 2006 third quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "The decline in U.S. Treasury bond yields during the third quarter caused a further inversion of the yield curve which continued to exert pressure on our net interest margin and earnings while limiting the opportunities for profitable balance sheet growth.  Accordingly, we continued our strategy of shrinking the balance sheet by reducing the securities portfolio and borrowings, growing loans and deposits and repurchasing our stock." 
          Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.24 Per Share
          The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 18, 2006 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share.  The dividend is payable on December 1, 2006 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2006. This is the forty-sixth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. 
          Eleventh Stock Repurchase Program Continues
          During the third quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $30.41 per share.  During the nine month period ended September 30, 2006, Astoria repurchased a total of 6.5 million shares, completing its tenth stock repurchase program and commencing its eleventh stock repurchase program in the first quarter.  Under the current stock repurchase program, 3.7 million shares of the 10 million shares authorized remain available for repurchase. 
          Third Quarter and Nine Month Earnings Summary
          Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 totaled $90.7 million compared to $101.3 million for the 2006 second quarter and $118.5 million for the third quarter a year ago.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, net interest income totaled $303.5 million compared to $365.1 million for the comparable 2005 nine month period.
          Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 declined to 1.75% from 1.92% for the previous quarter and 2.20% for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, primarily due to the cost of interest- bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.
          Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 totaled $22.9 million compared to $28.4 million for the 2005 third quarter.  The decrease is primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, net, primarily due to the MSR valuation adjustments, as well as lower customer service fees.
          For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, non-interest income totaled $67.5 million compared to $75.6 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The decline was primarily due to a $5.5 million, pre-tax, charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements in the 2006 first quarter, a $1.3 million decrease in mortgage banking income, net, and a $0.9 million decrease in other loan fees, due primarily to the outsourcing of mortgage loan servicing effective December 1, 2005.
          The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non- interest income, are detailed below:
          General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 declined $4.6 million to $53.3 million from $57.9 million for the comparable 2005 period due primarily to a $3.5 million reduction in compensation and benefits expense and a reduction in other expense due to an $850,000 reimbursement for certain legal fees.  The decrease in compensation and benefits expense is primarily a result of the outsourcing of mortgage servicing and further reductions in incentive compensation accruals, partially offset by increases in stock-based compensation.
          For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, G&A declined $11.2 million to $164.8 million from $176.0 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The decrease was predominantly due to a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and benefits expense, a $5.2 million decrease in other expense due primarily to lower goodwill litigation expense, and a $1.9 million decrease in advertising expense, partially offset by a $1.4 million increase in occupancy, equipment and systems expense primarily related to the outsourcing of mortgage servicing. 
          Balance Sheet Summary
          The further inversion of the yield curve during the third quarter continued to narrow spread availability. Accordingly, we continued to reduce our balance sheet through the reduction of non-core business activities. Total securities for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 declined $272.2 million, or 19% annualized, to $5.6 billion at September 30, 2006, representing 26% of total assets.  Borrowings declined in the third quarter of 2006 by $378.3 million, or 21% annualized, to $6.8 billion at September 30, 2006, representing 32% of total assets.
          For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, total securities declined $973.8 million, or 20% annualized, and borrowings declined $1.1 billion, or 19% annualized.  Total assets declined $262.3 million from June 30, 2006 and $781.1 million from December 31, 2005 and total $21.6 billion at September 30, 2006.
          Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
          The following table illustrates this improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
          Total loan production for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $868.6 million and $2.4 billion, respectively, compared to $1.3 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2005 periods.  The loan pipeline at September 30, 2006 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $333.5 million, or 41%, over the pipeline at June 30, 2006.
          During the 2006 third quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $107.1 million, or 4% annualized, from the previous quarter and totaled $9.9 billion at September 30, 2006.  For the quarter ended September 30, 2006, 1-4 family loan originations and purchases totaled $706.6 million compared to $983.4 million for the 2005 third quarter.  Of the 2006 third quarter production, 70% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage loans.
          For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $173.3 million, or 2% annualized.  For the nine month period ended September 30, 2006, 1-4 family loan originations and purchases totaled $1.8 billion compared to $2.4 billion in the year-ago nine month period.  Of the 2006 nine month loan production, 75% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage loans.
          During the 2006 third quarter, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $30.5 million, or 3% annualized, to $4.1 billion, or 28% of total loans, at September 30, 2006.  Multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $158.2 million for the 2006 third quarter compared to $270.6 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million.
          For the nine month period ended September 30, 2006, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $215.0 million, or 7% annualized.  Multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $559.4 million for the 2006 nine month period compared to $769.0 million in the comparable year-ago period.
          At September 30, 2006, non-performing loans totaled $55.1 million, or 0.25% of total assets, compared to $54.3 million, or 0.25% of total assets, at June 30, 2006 and $65.0 million, or 0.29% of total assets, at December 31, 2005.  Net charge-offs for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2006 totaled $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, compared to $472,000 and $711,000, respectively, for the comparable 2005 periods.  The increase in charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 was due, for the most part, to a $947,000 charge-off on a non-performing loan in foreclosure that was sold in the 2006 third quarter.  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at September 30, 2006 was 145%.
          Deposits for the 2006 third quarter increased $84.8 million to $13.2 billion at September 30, 2006.   During the 2006 third quarter, our efforts to extend deposit liabilities resulted in $1.5 billion of non-Liquid CDs issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 5.21% with a weighted average maturity of 12 months.
          For the nine months ended September 30, 2006, deposits increased $366.6 million, or 4% annualized. During that period $4.7 billion of non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 4.83% with a weighted average maturity of 12 months.
          Commenting on the bank's retail activity, Mr. Engelke noted, "Our marketing efforts continue to produce new customers from our communities, creating relationship development opportunities for us.  For example, during the nine months ended September 30, 2006, 19% of all new and existing CD customers, and 22% of all new and existing Liquid CD customers, without checking accounts, were cross-sold new, low-cost checking accounts, the linchpin product for building long-term, profitable customer relationships."
          Stockholders' equity was $1.3 billion, or 5.84% of total assets at September 30, 2006.  Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.84%, 6.84% and 12.66%, respectively, at September 30, 2006. 
          Future Outlook
          Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2006 and 2007, Mr. Engelke stated, "The interest rate environment remains very challenging, characterized by a prolonged flat-to-inverted yield curve that continues to negatively impact our net interest margin and earnings and limits opportunities for profitable growth.  We anticipate continued margin compression for the fourth quarter, although the magnitude of the compression will be less than the current quarter.  Looking forward, based on our economic forecasting model which currently includes three 25 basis point reductions by the Federal Reserve in 2007 and a gradual flattening of the yield curve, we expect the margin to remain relatively stable in 2007.  We will, as a result, continue our strategy of shrinking the balance sheet through reductions in the securities portfolio and borrowings through normal cash flow, while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve the quality of both the balance sheet and earnings. As we reduce the size of the balance sheet, we will continue to focus on the repurchase of our stock as a very desirable use of capital.  This strategy should better position us to take advantage of more profitable asset growth opportunities when the yield curve steepens."

Exhibit 99.1
          LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 25 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria" or "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $37.1 million, or $0.39 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, compared to $57.7 million, or $0.57 EPS, for the 2005 fourth quarter.  For the 2006 fourth quarter, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 11.99%, 14.09% and 0.69%, respectively, compared to 16.97%, 19.64% and 1.03%, respectively, for the comparable 2005 period.
          For the year ended December 31, 2006, net income totaled $174.9 million, or $1.80 EPS, compared to $233.8 million, or $2.26 EPS, for the comparable 2005 period.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 13.73%, 16.06% and 0.80%, respectively, compared to 17.06%, 19.72% and 1.02%, respectively, for the comparable 2005 period.
          2006 Full Year Financial Highlights
          Commenting on the 2006 fourth quarter and full year results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria noted, "The persistence of an inverted yield curve environment during the fourth quarter and most of the year continued to exert pressure on our net interest margin and earnings while limiting opportunities for profitable balance sheet growth.  Therefore, we continued to focus on improving the balance sheet by growing loans and deposits, reducing securities and repurchasing our stock."
          Board Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend 8%
          The Company also announced that the Board of Directors, at their January 24, 2007 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share, an increase of 8%.  The cash dividend is payable on March 1, 2007 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2007.  This is the forty-seventh consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Commenting on the Board's action, Mr. Engelke said, "The increase in the cash dividend is evidence of the Board's continued confidence in the fundamental strength of the Company and its commitment to enhancing shareholder value."
          Eleventh Stock Repurchase Program Continues
          During the 2006 fourth quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.9 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $29.55 per share.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, Astoria repurchased a total of 8.4 million shares, completing its tenth stock repurchase program and commencing its eleventh stock repurchase program in the 2006 first quarter.  Under the current stock repurchase program, 1.9 million shares of the 10 million shares authorized remain available for repurchase.
          Board Sets Annual Shareholders' Meeting Date
          The Board of Directors, at their January 24, 2007 meeting, established May 16, 2007 as the date for the Astoria Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a voting record date of March 26, 2007.
          Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary
          Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 totaled $86.9 million compared to $90.7 million for the 2006 third quarter and $113.7 million for the fourth quarter a year ago.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, net interest income totaled $390.4 million compared to $478.8 million for the comparable 2005 period.
           Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 declined to 1.69% from 1.75% for the previous quarter and 2.12% for the quarter ended December 31, 2005, primarily due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets. For the 2006 fourth quarter, multifamily/CRE loan prepayment penalty income increased to $4.0 million, from $2.1 million for the previous quarter and $3.0 million for the 2005 fourth quarter, primarily due to a $2.0 million prepayment penalty from a single CRE loan in the 2006 fourth quarter.  For the year ended December 31, 2006, the net interest margin declined to 1.87% from 2.19% for the 2005 full year period.
          Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 totaled $23.9 million compared to $26.6 million for the 2005 fourth quarter.  The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of $1.6 million in customer service fees, primarily NSF fees, and the absence of $1.3 million of non-recurring other income recorded in the 2005 fourth quarter.
          For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, non-interest income declined to $91.4 million from $102.2 million for the comparable 2005 period. The decline was due primarily to the following:  a $5.5 million charge associated with the termination of interest rate swap agreements in the 2006 first quarter, a $1.4 million decrease in customer service fees, a $1.2 million decrease in mortgage banking income, net, a $0.9 million decrease in other loan fees primarily due to the outsourcing of mortgage servicing and $1.7 million of non-recurring income recorded in 2005.  The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below:
          General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 totaled $57.0 million compared to $52.7 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The increase was primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, a $0.9 million increase in occupancy, equipment and systems expense, due, in part, to the outsourcing of mortgage servicing in 2005, and an $0.8 million increase in advertising expense.  The increase in compensation and benefits expense is due to the adoption of SFAS 123R, effective January 1, 2006, the granting of restricted stock and an increase in ESOP expense.
          For the year ended December 31, 2006, G&A declined $6.9 million to $221.8 million from $228.7 million for the comparable 2005 period.  This is due, in part, to a net decrease of $3.0 million in compensation and benefits expense resulting primarily from the outsourcing of mortgage servicing and other company-wide cost saving initiatives undertaken in 2005, partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation of $4.5 million due to the adoption of SFAS 123R and the granting of restricted stock.  In addition, there was a decrease of $5.1 million in other expense, primarily lower goodwill litigation expense, and a decrease of $1.1 million in advertising expense, partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in occupancy, equipment and systems expense primarily related to the outsourcing of mortgage servicing in 2005.
          Balance Sheet Summary           For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, total loans increased $225.8 million and $579.4 million, respectively, to $15.0 billion at December 31, 2006.  Total loan production for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2006 was $1.1 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, compared to $1.0 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2005 periods.  The loan pipeline at December 31, 2006 totaled $1.0 billion, a decline of $107 million from the 2006 third quarter.
          During the 2006 fourth quarter, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $283.0 million, or 11% annualized, from the previous quarter and totaled $10.2 billion at December 31, 2006.  1-4 family loan originations and purchases for the 2006 fourth quarter totaled $948.7 million compared to $837.6 million for the 2005 fourth quarter.  Of the 2006 fourth quarter production, 73% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage loans.
          For the year ended December 31, 2006, the 1-4 family mortgage loan portfolio increased $456.2 million, or 5%, fueled by loan originations and purchases totaling $2.7 billion compared to $3.3 billion for 2005.  Of the 2006 full year 1-4 family loan production, 74% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage loans.
          During the 2006 fourth quarter, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio decreased slightly and totaled $4.1 billion, or 27% of total loans, at December 31, 2006.  Multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $105.0 million for the 2006 fourth quarter compared to $183.9 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The average loan-to-value ratio of the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million.
          For the year ended December 31, 2006, the multifamily and CRE loan portfolio increased $185.0 million, or 5%.  Multifamily and CRE loan originations totaled $664.4 million for the 2006 full year compared to $952.9 million for 2005.
          At December 31, 2006, non-performing loans totaled $59.4 million, or 0.28% of total assets, compared to $55.1 million, or 0.25% of total assets, at September 30, 2006 and $65.0 million, or 0.29% of total assets, at December 31, 2005.  Net recoveries for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 totaled $12,000 compared to net charge-offs of $888,000 for the 2005 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net charge-offs totaled $1.2 million compared to $1.6 million for the comparable 2005 period.  The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at December 31, 2006 was 135%.
          For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2006, deposits increased $47.0 million and $413.6 million, respectively, to $13.2 billion at December 31, 2006.
          The continued inverted yield curve in the 2006 fourth quarter further reduced spread availability. We, therefore, continued to reduce non-core business activities.  Total securities for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 declined $258.8 million, or 18% annualized, to $5.3 billion at December 31, 2006, representing 25% of total assets.
          For the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, total securities declined $1.2 billion, or 19%, and borrowings declined $1.1 billion, or 14%.  Total assets declined $825.8 million from December 31, 2005 and totaled $21.6 billion at December 31, 2006.
          Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
          The following table illustrates this improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
          Stockholders' equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.64% of total assets at December 31, 2006.  Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.62%, 6.62% and 12.27%, respectively, at December 31, 2006.
          Future Outlook           Commenting on the outlook for 2007, Mr. Engelke stated, "The interest rate environment continues to remain very challenging, characterized by a prolonged inversion of the yield curve.  During 2007, we continue to expect a gradual flattening of the yield curve and a relatively stable net interest margin, similar to the 2006 fourth quarter margin. We will, therefore, continue our strategy of reducing the securities portfolio while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve the quality of both the balance sheet and earnings.  While we will continue to focus on the repurchase of our stock as a very desirable use of capital, the pace of the buyback activity is expected to be slower than in 2006 as we maintain tangible capital levels at or near 4.75%.  This strategy should better position us to take advantage of more profitable asset growth opportunities when the yield curve steepens."
          Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $21.6 billion is the fifth largest thrift institution in the United States.  Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $13.2 billion and embraces its philosophy of Putting people first by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, http://www.astoriafederal.com.

ITEMS 1 THROUGH 7  NOT APPLICABLE.
          On February 1, 2007, Astoria Financial Corporation (the "Company"), issued a press release announcing the decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the Long Island Savings Bank supervisory goodwill litigation.  The full text of the press release is included herein as exhibit 99.1.
          Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

Exhibit 99.1
          LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Feb. 1 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF), (the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), the successor by merger in 1998 to Long Island Savings Bank, FSB ("LISB"), announced today that a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit entered a decision in the case of The Long Island Savings Bank, FSB, and The Long Island Savings Bank of Centereach, FSB, v. United States, (2006-5029). The decision reverses the decisions of the United States Court of Federal Claims awarding Astoria Federal $435,755,000 in damages for breach of contract arising from the supervisory acquisition of Suffolk County Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Suffolk County Federal") by LISB in August 1983. The appellate court held that, due to the actions of the former chief executive officer of LISB at the time of the acquisition of Suffolk County Federal, any contract claims against the government were forfeited.
          Commenting on the decision, Alan P. Eggleston, Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company and Astoria Federal stated, "We are obviously disappointed by the decision of the Court. We are currently reviewing the opinion and considering our alternatives." 
          Astoria Financial Corporation, the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, with assets of $21.6 billion is the fifth largest thrift institution in the United States.

          On February 21, 2007, the Board of Directors of Astoria Financial Corporation (the "Corporation") approved an amendment to the Corporation's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code"). The Code was amended to clarify existing policy of Astoria related to conflicts of interest. The Code precluded Directors, Officers or Employees from representing Astoria in any Transaction if their personal interest might influence their ability to represent Astoria's interest impartially and to the best of their ability. The Code was amended to emphasize that Directors when involved in the exercise of lending authority may not have any financial interest in the prospective borrower. It was also amended to clarify that while immaterial investments in publicly traded companies obtained in open market transaction is authorized, Directors, Officers, Employees or Affiliated Persons otherwise dealing on behalf of Astoria with customers, borrowers, suppliers or others, must disclose any personal business relationships with such party to Astoria. A copy of the Code, as amended, is posted on the Corporation's Investor Relations website at http://ir.astoriafederal.com under the heading "Corporate Governance". For more detailed information concerning the Code, as amended, reference is made to the Astoria Financial Corporation Code of Business Conduct and Ethics filed as Exhibit 14.1 herein.
Item 8.01          Other Events
          On February 21, 2007, Astoria Financial Corporation revised its outlook for 2007 which includes a delay in the gradual flattening of the yield curve until the latter half of 2007 which may result in modest compression of the 2007 net interest margin relative to the margin for the 2006 fourth quarter.  The revised outlook is included in Astoria Financial Corporation's 4Q2006 written investor presentation material on page 30 and filed as Exhibit 99.1 herein.

Exhibit 14.1
          Astoria Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, have always followed the highest principles of business ethics in their dealings with Employees, customers, other persons with whom we do business and the general public. That is the reputation we now enjoy. It is the reputation we intend to keep.
          To maintain this standard, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board of Directors has adopted this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics formalizes the principles by which we have conducted business for many years. It is addressed to all Directors, Officers and Employees of Astoria Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. All such persons must certify that they have read this statement, understand our policies and their responsibilities concerning business conduct and are expected to conform to the requirements of this Code. Difficulties can generally be minimized or avoided entirely if individuals seek the assistance of the Director of Human Resources at the outset of a problem or concern.
          No Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can replace the "thoughtful behavior of an ethical director, officer or employee." It can, however, focus our attention on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to our personnel, provide a mechanism to report unethical behavior and further our culture of honesty and integrity. By reading this policy carefully and understanding and following its directives, we are confident that Astoria can maintain its valued reputation for the highest standards of business ethics.
1
          As used throughout this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the term "Astoria" refers to Astoria Financial Corporation and all of its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and its subsidiaries.

Exhibit 99.1
          LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., March 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF), ("Astoria"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), announced today that Moody's Investor Services ("Moody's") upgraded Astoria Federal's deposit rating to A1, a two notch increase from its previous deposit rating.

Its franchise value is supported by a solid retail footprint on Long Island (Queens, Brooklyn, Nassau and Suffolk counties).  Commenting on Moody's action, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President & CEO of Astoria stated, "The ratings increases by Moody's validate the implementation of our business plan which continues to focus on growing our core businesses, mortgage lending and retail banking, limiting credit risk and strictly controlling operating expenses."

Exhibit 99.1 ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER EPS OF $0.38 QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.26 PER SHARE DECLARED; 10% STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., April 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria", the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $35.8 million, or $0.38 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, compared to $48.9 million, or $0.49 EPS, for the 2006 first quarter. For the quarter ended March 31, 2007, returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 11.81%, 13.93% and 0.67%, respectively, compared to 14.77%, 17.17% and 0.88%, respectively, for the comparable 2006 period. 2007 First Quarter Financial Highlights: * Deposits increased $198 million, or 6% annualized * Loan portfolio increased $124 million, or 3% annualized * One-to-four family loan portfolio increased $156 million, or 6% annualized * Securities portfolio decreased $252 million, or 19% annualized * Borrowings decreased $440 million, or 26% annualized * Repurchased 1.0 million shares Commenting on the first quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "While the operating environment remained difficult during the first quarter, characterized by an inverted yield curve and limited opportunities for profitable asset growth, we continued to increase loans and deposits and reduce securities and borrowings, resulting in an improvement in the quality of both the balance sheet and earnings." Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.26 Per Share The Board of Directors of the Company, at their April 18, 2007 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. The dividend is payable on June 1, 2007 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2007. This is the forty-eighth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. Eleventh Stock Repurchase Program Continues; Twelfth Stock Repurchase Program Authorized During the 2007 first quarter, Astoria repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $28.35 per share. Under the current stock repurchase program, 867,300 shares of the 10 million shares authorized remain available for repurchase. Astoria also announced that the Board of Directors of the Company, at their April 18, 2007 meeting, approved its twelfth stock repurchase program which authorizes the purchase of ten million shares, or approximately 10% of its outstanding common stock, in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. Mr. Engelke commented, "The authorization of this new stock repurchase program provides us with continued flexibility in capital management and demonstrates our ongoing commitment to enhancing shareholder value." The newly approved stock repurchase program will commence immediately upon completion of the current program.
First Quarter 2007 Earnings Summary Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 totaled $87.5 million compared to $86.9 million for the 2006 fourth quarter and $111.5 million for the 2006 first quarter. Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 increased two basis points on a linked quarter basis and declined thirty-nine basis points from the comparable period a year ago to 1.71%. The linked quarter increase was due primarily to the impact of two less days of interest expense in the 2007 first quarter, or approximately eight basis points, partially offset by the 2006 fourth quarter margin benefit of four basis points attributable to a $2.0 million prepayment penalty from a single CRE loan. The year over year decline in the net interest margin was primarily due to the cost of liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on earning assets. Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 totaled $22.6 million compared to $18.9 million for the 2006 first quarter. The increase is due primarily to a $5.5 million, pre-tax, charge incurred in the 2006 first quarter for the termination of interest rate swap agreements, partially offset by lower customer service fees and mortgage banking income, net, in the 2007 first quarter. The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non- interest income, are detailed below: (Dollars in millions) 1Q07 1Q06 ----------------------------- -------- ------- Loan servicing fees $ 1.0 $ 1.2 Amortization of MSR* (0.9) (1.0) MSR* valuation adjustments 0.1 0.7 Net gain on sale of loans 0.4 0.6 Mortgage banking income, net $ 0.6 $ 1.5 * Mortgage servicing rights General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 totaled $57.1 million compared to $57.0 million for the 2006 fourth quarter and $56.3 million for the 2006 first quarter. The year over year increase is due primarily to a 2.7% increase in compensation and benefits expense. Balance Sheet Summary For the 2007 first quarter, total loans increased $124.0 million to $15.1 billion at March 31, 2007. Total loan production for the 2007 first quarter was $896.0 million compared to $750.4 million for the comparable 2006 period. The loan pipeline at March 31, 2007 totaled $1.4 billion, an increase of $332 million from December 31, 2006. For the 2007 first quarter, the one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio increased $156.2 million, or 6% annualized, and totaled $10.4 billion at March 31, 2007. One-to-four family loan originations and purchases totaled $760.0 million for the 2007 first quarter compared to $522.0 million in the year-ago first quarter. Of the 2007 first quarter production, 73% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans. For the 2007 first quarter, the multi-family and CRE loan portfolio increased slightly and totaled $4.1 billion at March 31, 2007. Multi- family/CRE loan originations totaled $134.0 million for the 2007 first quarter compared to $217.4 million for the comparable 2006 period. The average loan-to-value ("LTV") ratio of the combined multi-family and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million.
At March 31, 2007, non-performing loans totaled $67.9 million, or 0.32% of total assets, compared to $59.4 million, or 0.28% of total assets, at December 31, 2006. Net loan recoveries for the quarter ended March 31, 2007 totaled $155,000 compared to net loan recoveries of $12,000 for the 2006 fourth quarter. The increase in non-performing loans was due primarily to a $7.2 million increase in one-to-four family non-performing loans. As of March 31, 2007, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $48.4 million and multi- family/CRE non-performing loans totaled $17.7 million. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at March 31, 2007 was 118%. Deposits increased $198.0 million for the 2007 first quarter, or 6% on an annualized basis, and total $13.4 billion at March 31, 2007. Due to the continued yield curve inversion and lower spread availability, we continued to reduce non-core business activities during the 2007 first quarter. Total securities declined $252.0 million, or 19% annualized, to $5.1 billion, representing 24% of total assets at March 31, 2007. Borrowings declined in the 2007 first quarter by $439.8 million, or 26% annualized, to $6.4 billion, representing 30% of total assets at March 31, 2007. Total assets declined $160.7 million from December 31, 2006 to $21.4 billion at March 31, 2007. Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Company's balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow: The following table illustrates this improvement on an outstanding per share basis: Stockholders' equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.69% of total assets, at March 31, 2007. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.88%, 6.88% and 12.66%, respectively, at March 31, 2007. Future Outlook Commenting on the outlook for 2007, Mr. Engelke stated, "The interest rate environment continues to remain very challenging, characterized by a prolonged inversion of the yield curve. We continue to expect a gradual flattening of the yield curve to occur during the latter half of 2007 and into 2008 and a relatively stable net interest margin for 2007, similar to the adjusted 2007 first quarter margin, or approximately 1.63%. We will, therefore, maintain our strategy of reducing the securities portfolio while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve the quality of both the balance sheet and earnings. We will also focus on the repurchase of our stock as a very desirable use of capital, maintaining the Company's tangible capital levels at or near 4.75%. This strategy should better position us to take advantage of more profitable asset growth opportunities when the yield curve steepens."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria," the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $34.1 million, or $0.37 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, compared to $47.8 million, or $0.49 EPS, for the 2006 second quarter. For the 2007 second quarter, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 11.35%, 13.42% and 0.63%, respectively, compared to 14.94%, 17.48% and 0.87%, respectively, for the comparable 2006 period.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, net income totaled $69.8 million, or $0.75 EPS, compared to $96.7 million, or $0.98 EPS, for the comparable 2006 period. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 11.59%, 13.70% and 0.65%, respectively, compared to 14.87%, 17.34% and 0.87%, respectively, for the comparable 2006 period.
 
First Half 2007 Balance Sheet Highlights:
-- Loan portfolio increased $611 million, or 8% annualized
-- One-to-four family loan portfolio increased $695 million, or 14% 
annualized
-- Deposits increased $224 million, or 3% annualized
-- Securities portfolio decreased $552 million, or 21% annualized
-- Borrowings decreased $138 million, or 4% annualized
-- Repurchased 1.8 million shares
Commenting on the 2007 second quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, "The inverted yield curve, which has persisted for over a year, has recently become slightly positively sloped. While the recent increase in long-term interest rates is positive, there is a lag in the benefit to Astoria, as our interest-bearing liabilities continue to reprice somewhat faster than our interest-earning assets. During this challenging environment, I am pleased to report that we have continued to increase both loans and deposits during the second quarter, while controlling operating expenses and maintaining excellent asset quality."
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.26 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 18, 2007 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. The dividend is payable on September 4, 2007 to shareholders of record as of August 15, 2007. This is the forty-ninth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.

Under the eleventh stock repurchase program, 117,300 shares remain available for repurchase as of June 30, 2007. During the six month period ended June 30, 2007 Astoria repurchased a total of 1.8 million shares. The Company, as previously announced, has in place its twelfth stock repurchase program which authorizes the repurchase of ten million shares of its common stock. The twelfth stock repurchase program will commence immediately upon completion of the eleventh stock repurchase program.

Astoria's net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 was 1.62% compared to 1.71% for the 2007 first quarter and 1.92% for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. On a linked quarter basis, in addition to the impact of the cost of interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets, approximately four basis points of the nine basis point decline is due to one extra day of interest expense in the second quarter. The year over year decrease in the net interest margin is also due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.
 
Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 increased to $26.3 million from $25.7 million for the 2006 second quarter. The increase is primarily due to a $2.0 million gain related to an insurance payment received in the 2007 second quarter, partially offset by lower mortgage banking income, net.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, non-interest income totaled $48.9 million compared to $44.6 million for the comparable 2006 period. Non-interest income for the 2007 six month period reflected a decrease of $1.8 million in mortgage banking income, net, while the 2006 six month period included a $5.5 million, pre-tax, charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements in the 2006 first quarter.
 
The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below:
 
* Mortgage servicing rights
 
General and administrative expense ("G&A") for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 increased to $58.7 million from $57.1 million for the 2007 first quarter and $55.2 million for the comparable 2006 period. The linked quarter increase is primarily due to a $2.3 million increase in goodwill litigation expense, offset primarily by lower compensation and benefits expense. The year over year increase is due primarily to increases in goodwill litigation expense and compensation and benefits expense.
 
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2007, G&A increased $4.3 million to $115.8 million from $111.5 million for the comparable 2006 period. The increase was primarily due to a $2.8 million increase in goodwill litigation expense and a $2.3 million increase in compensation and benefits expense.

Future Outlook
 
Commenting on the outlook for the second half of 2007, Mr. Engelke stated, "The operating environment has improved slightly in the last several months, but remains challenging. The yield curve, which has recently become positively sloped, still remains relatively flat, limiting profitable growth opportunities. We expect the yield curve to remain relatively flat for the remainder of 2007 and into 2008 which will result in a relatively stable net interest margin for 2007, similar to the 2007 second quarter margin. We will, therefore, maintain our strategy of reducing the securities portfolio while we emphasize deposit and loan growth, all of which will continue to improve the quality of both the balance sheet and earnings. We will also focus on the repurchase of our stock as a very desirable use of capital, maintaining the Company's tangible capital levels between 4.50% and 4.75%."

Astoria Financial Corporation (the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (the Association), at its Board of Directors meeting held on August 15, 2007, implemented the following executive management changes, effective immediately:
Identical corporate title changes were effectuated with respect to the Association.
The Boards of Directors of the Company and the Association at their meetings held on August 15, 2007 also rescinded the Companys and the Associations Executive Officer Mandatory Retirement Policy. This policy had required that executive officers retire as officers and employees of the Association and the Company upon attaining 70 years of age. In connection with this action, Mr. Engelke was asked to remain an officer and employee beyond his 70
th
birthday and he agreed to do so.
The Corporation and Association have offered to enter into a three year employment agreement with Mr. Fusco, subject to his agreement to rescind his existing Change of Control Severance Agreement. Such employment agreement is on substantially the same terms and conditions as that of the remaining six executive officers of the Company and the Association. A description of such employment agreements, subject to certain amendments described below, is set forth in the Companys Schedule 14A Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2007 (File No. 011-11967) under the section Other Potential Post-Employment Payments which is incorporated by reference herein. The employment agreements of the remaining six executive officers, including Mr. Engelke and Mr. Redman were also amended to reflect their current salaries and titles, as necessary, and to remove the provision related to termination of employment upon attaining mandatory retirement age, in addition to certain other non-substantive changes.
 
 
 
The Compensation Committee of the Company added Mr. Fusco as a participant in the Astoria Financial Corporation Executive Officer Annual Incentive Plan (the Executive Incentive Plan) effective August 15, 2007. Also effective on such date, Mr. Redmans target incentive was changed from fifty percent (50%) to sixty percent (60%) of base salary. A description of the Executive Incentive Plan is set forth in the Companys Schedule 14A Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2007 (File No. 011-11967) under the section Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Short-Term Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation which is incorporated by reference herein.
 
Mr. Fusco has an existing mortgage loan and home equity line of credit with the Association. These loans were previously granted pursuant to the terms of the Associations Employee & Director Mortgage & Home Equity Loan Policy which provides, under specified circumstances, for certain interest rate and fee discounts to eligible employees. A description of the Employee & Director Mortgage & Home Equity Loan Policy is set forth in the Companys Schedule 14A Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 10, 2007 (File No. 011-11967) under the section Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Perquisites - Employee & Director Mortgage & Home Equity Loan Policy which is incorporated by reference herein. These loans were otherwise made in the ordinary course of the Associations business and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features. Such loans are not classified as nonaccrual, past due, restructured or as potential problem loans.
On August 15, 2007, the Company issued a press release announcing the above referenced actions. A copy of the press release is filed herewith as an exhibit to this report.

LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Aug. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria" or "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today announced the following executive management changes, effective immediately:
 
Monte N. Redman, 56, currently Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, was named President and Chief Operating Officer, a newly created position with the Company;
 
Frank E. Fusco, 44, currently Senior Vice President and Treasurer, was named Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer; and
George L. Engelke, Jr., 68, currently Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, will retain the title Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Identical corporate title changes were effectuated with respect to Astoria Federal.
 
Mr. Engelke has been employed by Astoria Federal for over 35 years, while Mr. Redman has been employed for over 30 years and Mr. Fusco for over 17 years.
The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on August 15, 2007, also acted to rescind the Company's and Astoria Federal's Executive Officer Mandatory Retirement Policy, which had previously required the retirement of any executive officer attaining 70 years of age.
 
Commenting on the actions, Mr. Ralph F. Palleschi, Presiding Director of the Company and Chairman of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, stated, "The management changes are the result of the Board of Directors' continuing review of management succession alternatives. The rescinding of the mandatory retirement policy provides the Board with the ability to retain the strengthened management team for other than a finite term during this challenging period. The Board approached Mr. Engelke requesting that he consider remaining an active officer of the Company beyond his previously mandated retirement date, and I am pleased to report that he has agreed to do so."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Lake Success, New York, October 18, 2007
 
--
Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), today reported net income of $35.3 million, or $0.39 diluted earnings per share (EPS), for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, compared to $41.1 million, or $0.43 EPS, for the 2006 third quarter. For the 2007 third quarter, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 11.82%, 13.99% and 0.66%, respectively, compared to 13.06%, 15.31% and 0.76%, respectively, for the comparable 2006 period.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net income totaled $105.1 million, or $1.14 EPS, compared to $137.8 million, or $1.40 EPS, for the comparable 2006 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, annualized returns on average equity, average tangible equity and average assets were 11.67%, 13.79% and 0.65%, respectively, compared to 14.27%, 16.67% and 0.84%, respectively, for the comparable 2006 period.
Commenting on the quarterly results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, The 2007 third quarter operating results were in line with our expectations and continued to reflect the impact of a prolonged flat-to-inverted yield curve. The recent decrease in interest rates by the Federal Reserve has produced a positively sloped yield curve and a more favorable operating environment for us going forward.
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.26 Per Share
 
1
 
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 17, 2007 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. The dividend is payable on December 3, 2007 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2007. This is the fiftieth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Eleventh Stock Repurchase Program Completed; Twelfth Stock Repurchase Program Commenced
During the 2007 third quarter, Astoria completed its eleventh stock repurchase program and commenced its twelfth stock repurchase program, repurchasing 750,000 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $25.38 per share. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2007 Astoria repurchased a total of 2.5 million shares. Under the twelfth program, 9.4 million shares remain available for repurchase.
Third Quarter and Nine Month Earnings Summary
Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 totaled $81.2 million compared to $82.9 million for the 2007 second quarter and $90.7 million for the third quarter a year ago. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net interest income totaled $251.6 million compared to $303.5 million for the comparable 2006 nine month period.
Astorias net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 was 1.58% compared to 1.62% for the 2007 second quarter and 1.75% for the quarter ended September 30, 2006. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the net interest margin was 1.63% compared to 1.93% for the 2006 nine month period. The four basis point decrease, on a linked quarter basis, is due to one extra day of interest expense in the 2007 third quarter. The year over year quarter and nine month decreases are due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 increased $1.9 million to $24.8 million from $22.9 million for the 2007 third quarter, due entirely to a gain on the sale of an equity security position.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, non-interest income totaled $73.7 million compared to $67.5 million for the comparable 2006 period. Non-interest income for the 2006 nine month period included a $5.5 million, pre-tax, charge related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements in the 2006 first quarter.
The components of mortgage banking income, net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below:
* Mortgage servicing rights

General and administrative expense (G&A) for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 declined $2.2 million to $56.5 million from $58.7 million for the 2007 second quarter and increased $3.2 million from the 2006 third quarter. The linked quarter decrease is primarily due to lower goodwill litigation and advertising expense. The third quarter year over year increase is due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits expense.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, G&A increased $7.6 million to $172.4 million from $164.8 million for the comparable 2006 period. The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and goodwill litigation expense.
Income tax expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 decreased $2.8 million from the prior quarter to $13.6 million, for an effective tax rate of 27.9%, due to the release of accruals for previous tax positions that have statutorily expired. It is expected that the fourth quarter effective tax rate should return to a more normal level of approximately 30%.

For the 2007 third quarter, the loan portfolio increased $371.0 million from the prior quarter, or 9.5% on an annualized basis, to $16.0 billion at September 30, 2007.

For the 2007 third quarter, the multi-family and commercial real estate (CRE) loan portfolio decreased $32.6 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower loan originations which totaled $90.5 million compared to loan originations of $158.2 million for the comparable 2006 period. At September 30, 2007, the combined multi-family and CRE loan portfolio totaled $4.0 billion, or 25% of total loans.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, the multi-family and CRE loan portfolio decreased $54.4 million primarily due to lower loan originations which totaled $344.4 million compared to $559.4 million for the 2006 nine month period. The average loan-to-value ratio of the combined multi-family and CRE loan portfolio continues to be less than 65%, based on current principal balance and original appraised value, and the average loan balance is less than $1 million.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, non-performing loans increased $18.3 million from the previous quarter to $82.3 million, or 0.38% of total assets, primarily due to an increase in one-to-four family non-performing loans.
 
As of September 30, 2007, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $68.2 million and multi-family and CRE non-performing loans totaled $9.4 million. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at September 30, 2007 was 95%.
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 totaled $1.6 million compared to net loan charge-offs of $1.1 million for the 2006 third quarter. The 2007 third quarter charge-offs include a $1.5 million charge-off on a non-performing construction loan which was sold. For the nine months ended September 30, 2007, net loan charge-offs totaled $2.2 million, or just two basis points, annualized, of average loans, compared to $1.2 million, or one basis point, annualized, of average loans, for the 2006 nine month period.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2007, Astoria recorded a $500,000 provision for loan losses, the first provision in a number of years. Mr. Engelke noted, Our asset quality remains strong and net charge-offs remain very low. However, in recognition of, among other things, the recent increase in non-performing loans, an addition to our loan loss reserve was appropriate.
For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007, deposits decreased $181.9 million and increased $42.0 million, respectively, to $13.3 billion. During the third quarter, retail deposit pricing remained very competitive even as short-term market interest rates declined. As a result of our efforts to maintain deposit pricing discipline, we have taken advantage of lower cost borrowings for funding some of our loan growth this quarter, Mr. Engelke noted.
For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007, securities decreased $219.1million and $771.1 million, respectively, to $4.6 billion, or 21% of total assets at September 30, 2007. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2007, borrowings increased $231.2 million and $93.5 million, respectively, to $6.9 billion, or 32% of total assets at September 30, 2007. Total assets increased $96.2 million from the previous quarter and $191.6 million from December 31, 2006 and totaled $21.7 billion at September 30, 2007.

Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Companys balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following table illustrates this improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
 
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.54% of total assets at September 30, 2007. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.60%, 6.60% and 12.08%, respectively, at September 30, 2007.
Future Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2007 and 2008, Mr. Engelke stated, The recent decrease in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve has produced a more positively sloped yield curve and a more favorable operating environment for us going forward. In addition, the recent dislocation in the secondary residential mortgage market has resulted in improved loan volumes and mortgage spreads for portfolio lenders such as Astoria. We anticipate the yield curve will remain positively sloped for the remainder of 2007 and 2008 which should result in earning asset growth and an expansion of our net interest margin in 2008. Our focus going forward will be to continue to capitalize on residential mortgage market dislocations, which we believe will produce robust quality loan growth. Deposit growth will remain a focus; however, in the near term, if competitive pricing continues, we may fund some of our loan growth with lower cost borrowings and normal cash flow from the securities portfolio. We expect to continue to maintain the Companys tangible capital levels between 4.50% and 4.75%.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
Lake Success, New York - January 17, 2008 -
Astoria Financial Corporation ("Company") (NYSE: AF), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, announced today that it intends to record an other-than-temporary impairment non-cash after-tax charge of $13.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the quarter ended December 31, 2007 to reduce the carrying amount of its investment in two perpetual preferred stock issues of Freddie Mac, a government sponsored enterprise, to the securities' market value of $83 million at December 31, 2007. The perpetual preferred stock issues are investment grade securities (AA- by S&P and Aa3 by Moody's) that are held in the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio. Prior to this charge, impairment was recorded as an unrealized mark-to-market loss on securities available-for-sale and reflected as a reduction to equity through other comprehensive income. Accordingly, the reclassification of the unrealized after-tax loss to an other-than-temporary impairment non-cash charge will not affect shareholders' equity, tangible shareholders' equity or related capital ratios. George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Astoria commented, "The decision to reclassify the unrealized mark-to-market loss on these investment grade securities to an other-than-temporary impairment charge is based on the significant decline in the market value of these securities caused by Freddie Mac's recently announced negative financial results, capital raising activity and the unlikelihood of any near-term market value recovery."
 
Astoria Financial Corporation, as previously announced, expects to report fourth quarter and full year financial results on Wednesday afternoon, January 23, 2007.
Astoria Financial Corporation, with assets of $21.7 billion, is the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. Established in 1888, Astoria Federal is the largest thrift depository headquartered in New York with deposits of $13.3 billion and embraces its philosophy of "Putting people first" by providing the customers and local communities it serves with quality financial products and services through 86 convenient banking office locations and multiple delivery channels, including its enhanced website, www.astoriafederal.com.

Astoria Federal originates mortgage loans through its banking offices and loan production offices in New York, an extensive broker network covering twenty-two states, primarily the East Coast, and the District of Columbia, and through correspondent relationships covering twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, net income totaled $124.8 million (operating income of $138.1 million), or $1.36 EPS (operating EPS of $1.50), compared to $174.9 million (operating income of $178.6 million), or $1.80 EPS (operating EPS of $1.84), for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
Included in the fourth quarter and full year 2007 results is an other-than-temporary impairment, after-tax, non-cash charge of $13.3 million, or $0.15 EPS and $0.14 EPS, respectively, relating to Freddie Mac preferred stock, as reported in the Companys press release dated January 17, 2008. Operating income and operating EPS, representing net income and EPS determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) excluding the effects of the after-tax, non-cash charge noted above and a $3.7 million, after-tax, charge for the termination of our interest rate swap agreements in the 2006 first quarter, provide a meaningful comparison for effectively evaluating Astorias operating results. For a reconciliation of operating income and operating EPS to GAAP net income and EPS, please refer to the tables on page 14.
 
Commenting on the quarter and full year results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, The 2007 fourth quarter and full year operating results were in line with our expectations and continued to reflect the negative impact of a flat-to-inverted yield curve that persisted through the summer. Subsequently, four interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve beginning in September, totaling 175 basis points, have produced a positively sloped yield curve and a more favorable interest rate environment for us going forward.

Supervisory Goodwill Litigation Update
 
In the case of the Long Island Savings Bank goodwill claim for breach of contract, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, on December 28, 2007, denied both Astorias petition for a panel rehearing and a rehearing
en banc
and upheld the Courts most recent opinion which reversed an Astoria award of $435.8 million. Management is carefully reviewing its options with respect to any further legal action that may be taken in this matter.
 
In the case of the Fidelity New York goodwill claim, on January 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded Astoria $16.0 million in damages from the U.S. government for breach of contract. Management is carefully reviewing the decision and anticipates that the U.S. government, given its practice in similar cases, may file an appeal. If so, no assurance can be given as to the timing, content or ultimate outcome of the appeal.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary
 
Net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 increased to $81.9 million from $81.2 million for the 2007 third quarter, and declined from $86.9 million for the 2006 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net interest income, before provision for loan losses, totaled $333.5 million compared to $390.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
Astorias net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 was 1.57% compared to 1.58% for the 2007 third quarter and 1.69% for the quarter ended December 31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the net interest margin was 1.62% compared to 1.87% for the year ended December 31, 2006. The year-over-year quarter and full year decreases are due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities rising more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets. Commenting on the net interest margin, Mr. Engelke noted, The margin for the 2007 fourth quarter, in line with our expectations, represents an inflection point, with gradual improvement expected throughout 2008.

Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 totaled $2.1 million, including the previously announced other-than-temporary impairment non-cash pre-tax charge of $20.5 million, compared to $23.9 million for the comparable 2006 period. The decrease is primarily due to the impairment charge noted above and a decrease of $1.7 million in mortgage banking income, net, as detailed below. For the year ended December 31, 2007, non interest income totaled $75.8 million, including the aforementioned non-cash charge, compared to $91.4 million for 2006, including the $5.5 million pre-tax charge for the termination of interest rate swap agreements as noted earlier.
 
The components of mortgage banking (loss) income, net, which is included in non-interest income, are detailed below:
 
* Mortgage servicing rights
 
General and administrative expense (G&A) for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 increased $2.4 million, to $58.9 million from $56.5 million for the 2007 third quarter, and $1.9 million from $57.0 million for the 2006 fourth quarter. The linked quarter and year-over-year quarter increases are primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expense, including increased ESOP expense, and goodwill litigation expense partially offset by lower advertising expense.
 
For the full year 2007, G&A increased $9.5 million to $231.3 million from $221.8 million for the full year 2006. The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits expense and goodwill litigation expense, partially offset by lower advertising expense.
 
Income tax expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 decreased $13.2 million from the 2006 fourth quarter to $3.5 million due primarily to lower net income resulting from the non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $20.5 million incurred in the 2007 fourth quarter. It is expected that the effective tax rate for 2008 should return to a more normal level of approximately 31%.
 
Balance Sheet Summary
 
For the 2007 fourth quarter, the loan portfolio increased $201.7 million from the prior quarter, or 5% on an annualized basis, to $16.2 billion at December 31, 2007.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio increased $1.4 billion, or 14%. Loan originations and purchases totaled $3.8 billion for 2007 compared to $2.7 billion for 2006. The loan-to-value ratio of the 2007 one-to-four family loan production for portfolio averaged 65% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $550,000. Of the 2007 production for portfolio, 78% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the multi-family and commercial real estate (CRE) loan portfolio decreased $56.0 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower loan originations which totaled $66.0 million compared to $105.0 million for the 2006 fourth quarter. At December 31, 2007, the combined multi-family and CRE loan portfolio totaled $4.0 billion, or 25% of total loans.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2007, the multi-family and CRE loan portfolio decreased $110.4 million primarily due to lower loan originations which totaled $410.4 million compared to $664.4 million for the comparable 2006 period. The loan-to-value ratio of the 2007 multi-family/CRE loan production averaged 65% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $1.3 million.
 
Asset Quality
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, non-performing loans increased $24.0 million from the previous quarter to $106.3 million, or 0.49% of total assets, primarily due to an increase in one-to-four family non-performing loans. Loans that have missed only two payments and are currently included in non-performing loans totaled $38.3 million at December 31, 2007, an increase of $14.2 million from the previous quarter and represent 59% of the total increase in non-performing loans in the 2007 fourth quarter. At December 31, 2007, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $89.4 million and multi-family non-performing loans totaled $14.2 million. Mr. Engelke noted, While we have never actively participated in high-risk residential mortgage lending, as a geographically diversified lender, we are not immune to some negative consequences arising from overall economic weakness and, in particular, a sharp downturn in the housing industry nationally. Accordingly, although our total loan delinquencies remained stable on a linked quarter basis, our non-performing loans increased as noted above; therefore, we anticipate that our non-performing loans and credit costs could increase somewhat during 2008, but our asset quality should remain strong as we maintain conservative underwriting standards.
 
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended December 31, 2007 totaled $1.3 million compared to $1.6 million for the previous quarter and net recoveries of $12,000 for the 2006 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2007, net loan charge-offs totaled $3.5 million, or just two basis points of average loans, compared to $1.2 million, or one basis point of average loans, for the year ended December 31, 2006.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2007, Astoria recorded a $2.0 million provision for loan losses, up from $500,000 recorded in the previous quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2007, provision for loan losses totaled $2.5 million compared to no provision in 2006.
 
For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, deposits decreased $216.6 million and $174.6 million, respectively, to $13.0 billion. During the fourth quarter, retail deposit pricing remained very competitive even as short-term market interest rates declined. As a result of our efforts to maintain deposit pricing discipline, we have taken advantage of lower cost borrowings for funding some of our loan growth during this quarter, Mr. Engelke noted.

For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, securities decreased $197.7 million and $968.8 million, respectively, to $4.4 billion, or 20% of total assets at December 31, 2007. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2007, borrowings increased $255.2 million and $348.7 million, respectively, to $7.2 billion, or 33% of total assets at December 31, 2007. Total assets were essentially unchanged from the previous quarter and increased $164.8 million from December 31, 2006 to $21.7 billion at December 31, 2007.
 
Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Companys balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following table illustrates this improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
 
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.58% of total assets at December 31, 2007. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.58%, 6.58% and 12.04%, respectively, at December 31, 2007.
 
Future Outlook
 
Commenting on the outlook for 2008, Mr. Engelke stated, The decrease in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve has produced a more positively sloped yield curve and a more favorable interest rate environment for us going forward. We anticipate the yield curve will remain positively sloped and steepen further in 2008 which should result in improved opportunities for earnings growth and an expansion of our net interest margin. Our focus going forward will be to continue to capitalize on residential mortgage market opportunities that result in improved loan volumes and mortgage spreads. Loan growth may be tempered somewhat as we have reduced the number of states in which we will originate residential loans due to the advanced economic declines in those markets. This is evidenced by the loan pipeline at December 31, 2007 which, at $1.1 billion, is $221.4 million lower than the loan pipeline at September 30, 2007. Deposit growth will remain a focus; however, in the near term, if competitive pricing continues, we will fund some of our loan growth with lower cost borrowings. We expect to continue to maintain the Companys tangible capital levels between 4.50% and 4.75%.

Long Island Savings Bank Claim
         
On December 28, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit denied both Astoria's petition for a panel rehearing and a rehearing
en banc
and upheld the Court's most recent opinion which reversed Astoria's award of $435.8 million
.
Management is carefully reviewing its options with respect to any further legal action that may be taken in this matter.
Fidelity NY Claim
         
On January 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded Astoria $16.0 million in damages. AF anticipates that the U.S. government, given its practice in similar cases, may file an appeal.  If so, no assurance can be given as to the timing, content or ultimate outcome of the appeal.

We anticipate the yield curve will remain positively sloped and steepen further in 2008 which should result in improved opportunities for earnings growth and an expansion of our net interest margin.

Forward Looking Statement
This presentation may contain a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Forward-looking statements are based on various assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our management's experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  These factors include, without limitation, the following: the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control; there may be increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins or affect the value of our investments; changes in deposit flows, loan demand or real estate values may adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines may cause our financial condition to be perceived differently; general economic conditions, either nationally or locally in some or all areas in which we do business, or conditions in the real estate or securities markets or the banking industry may be less favorable than we currently anticipate; legislative or regulatory changes may adversely affect our business; applicable technological changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; success or consummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; or litigation or matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, may be determined adverse to us or may delay occurrence or non-occurrence of events longer than we anticipate.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.

Long Island Savings Bank Claim
         
On December 28, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Federal Circuit denied both Astoria's petition for a panel rehearing and a rehearing
en banc
and upheld the Court's most recent opinion which reversed Astoria's award of $435.8 million
.
Management is carefully reviewing its options with respect to any further legal action that may be taken in this matter.
Fidelity NY Claim
         
On January 8, 2008, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded Astoria $16.0 million in damages. AF anticipates that the U.S. government, given its practice in similar cases, may file an appeal.  If so, no assurance can be given as to the timing, content or ultimate outcome of the appeal.
Goodwill Claims - Update

We anticipate the yield curve will remain positively sloped and steepen further in 2008 which should result in improved opportunities for earnings growth and an expansion of our net interest margin.

Lake Success, New York - April 16, 2008 -
Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), today reported net income of $28.9 million, or $0.32 diluted earnings per share (EPS), for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, compared to $35.8 million, or $0.38 EPS, for the 2007 first quarter.
 
Commenting on the first quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, While the operating environment has improved during the first quarter, our results were tempered by accelerated loan premium amortization due to significantly elevated residential mortgage loan prepayments, which negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.04 and the net interest margin by ten basis points versus the trailing quarter results. We also experienced a modest decline in the loan portfolio and balance sheet. We expect loan growth will resume in the second quarter due to the 95% increase in the mortgage loan pipeline during the first quarter to $2.2 billion at March 31, 2008.
 
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.26 Per Share
 
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their April 16, 2008 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. The dividend is payable on June 2, 2008 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2008. This is the fifty-second consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
 
Twelfth Stock Repurchase Program Continues
 
During the 2008 first quarter, Astoria repurchased 290,000 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $25.55 per share. Under the current stock repurchase program, 8.6 million shares remain available for repurchase as of March 31, 2008.
 
First Quarter 2008 Earnings Summary
 
Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 totaled $80.8 million compared to $81.9 million for the 2007 fourth quarter and $87.5 million for the 2007 first quarter.
 
1
Astorias net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 was 1.57%, unchanged from the 2007 fourth quarter and down from 1.71% for the 2007 first quarter. As previously mentioned, the 2008 first quarter margin was negatively impacted by the increase in loan premium amortization as a result of accelerated loan prepayments. We expect that the net interest margin will expand in the second quarter, as we increasingly realize the repricing benefit of deposit and borrowing liabilities with rates that are considerably above current market rates. CDs and Liquid CDs totaling $7.6 billion, with a weighted average rate of 4.32%, and borrowings totaling $2.2 billion, with a weighted average rate of 4.91%, are scheduled to mature over the next twelve months, Mr. Engelke noted.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2008, a $4.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded compared to $2.0 million for the previous quarter and no provision for the 2007 first quarter. Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 totaled $22.4 million compared to $22.6 million for the 2007 first quarter.
 
General and administrative expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 totaled $58.2 million compared to $58.9 million for the 2007 fourth quarter and $57.1 million for the 2007 first quarter.
 
Balance Sheet Summary
 
In the 2008 first quarter, the loan portfolio decreased $453.5 million from the previous quarter end to $15.7 billion at March 31, 2008. Total loan production for the 2008 first quarter was $740.8 million compared to $896.0 million for the comparable 2007 period and $882.1 million for the 2007 fourth quarter. The loan pipeline at March 31, 2008 totaled $2.2 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2007.
 
The one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio decreased $352.7 million in the 2008 first quarter from the previous quarter end to $11.3 billion at March 31, 2008. One-to-four family loan originations and purchases totaled $673.5 million for the 2008 first quarter compared to $760.0 million for the 2007 first quarter and $816.1 million for the 2007 fourth quarter. One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 totaled $892.6 million compared to $475.0 million for the 2007 first quarter and $427.7 million for the 2007 fourth quarter.
 
The loan-to-value ratio of the first quarter 2008 one-to-four family loan production for portfolio averaged 58% and the loan amount averaged approximately $640,000.
 
Of the 2008 first quarter production for portfolio, 68% consisted of 3/1 and 5/1 hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans.
 
Commenting on the decline in both the loan origination volume and the one-to-four family loan portfolio in the first quarter, Mr. Engelke stated, In addition to accelerated prepayments, we experienced considerable fallout from the pipeline reported at year-end 2007, due primarily to the effect of the tightening of our underwriting standards in late 2007 and early 2008 and the rapid decline in market interest rates during the first quarter, including a decline in jumbo hybrid ARM loan rates by lenders participating in that market. The loan pipeline at the end of the first quarter includes loan applications submitted under our more stringent underwriting standards and with interest rates at or near current market rates. We believe this should lead to a reduction in pipeline fallout and a resumption of growth in the loan portfolio.
 
In the 2008 first quarter, the multi-family and CRE loan portfolio decreased $71.9 million from the prior quarter end and totaled $3.9 billion at March 31, 2008. Multi-family/CRE loan originations totaled $67.2 million for the 2008 first quarter compared to $134.0 million for the comparable 2007 period and $66.0 million for the 2007 fourth quarter. The loan-to-value ratio of the 2008 first quarter multi-family/CRE loan production averaged 62% and the loan amount averaged approximately $1.5 million.

Asset Quality
 
Effective January 1, 2008, the presentation of non-performing mortgage loans was changed to report mortgage loans which have missed three or more payments as non-performing in order to improve the transparency of the migration of delinquent loans in our portfolio and improve comparability of our non-performing loan disclosures with other institutions. Previously, our practice was to report mortgage loans
 
that have missed two or more payments as non-performing.
 
Applying the new presentation to both March 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, non-performing loans (NPL) for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 increased $38.5 million from the previous quarter to $106.6 million, or 0.50% of total assets, primarily due to an increase in one-to-four family non-performing loans.
 
At March 31, 2008, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $88.4 million and multi-family/CRE non-performing loans totaled $14.9 million.
 
 
The comparative table below illustrates the migration from 60-89 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent under both the previous and revised presentation:
The table below details, as of March 31, 2008, the states with a total of 1% or more of our one-to four-family loan portfolio and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states:

Commenting on asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, Although we have never actively participated in high-risk sub-prime residential lending, as a geographically diversified residential lender, we are not immune to some negative consequences arising from overall economic weakness and, in particular, a sharp downturn in the housing industry nationally. We anticipate our asset quality will remain strong as we maintain our consistently conservative underwriting standards. However, our non-performing loans and credit costs could increase somewhat during the remainder of 2008. Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2008 totaled $2.9 million compared to $1.3 million for the previous quarter and net recoveries of $155,000 for the 2007 first quarter.
 
Balance Sheet Summary (Continued)
 
For the quarter March 31, 2008, securities decreased $114.6 million, to $4.3 billion or 20% of total assets at March 31, 2008.
 
Deposits at March 31, 2008 were relatively unchanged from December 31, 2007 and totaled $13.0 billion. For the quarter ended March 31, 2008, borrowings decreased $332.8 million, to $6.9 billion or 32% of total assets at March 31, 2008. Total assets decreased $265.2 million from the previous quarter to $21.5 billion at March 31, 2008.
 
Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Companys balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The following table illustrates the above improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
 
 
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.74% of total assets, at March 31, 2008. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.72%, 6.72% and 12.38%, respectively, at March 31, 2008.
 
Future Outlook
 
Commenting on the outlook for 2008, Mr. Engelke stated, We anticipate the yield curve will remain positively sloped in 2008 providing opportunities for earnings growth and an expansion of our net interest margin. Loan growth should resume as evidenced by the significant increase in the mortgage loan pipeline at March 31, 2008. Deposit growth will remain a focus; however, in the near term, if competitive pricing continues, we will fund some of our loan growth with lower cost borrowings. The Companys tangible capital ratio target remains between 4.50% and 4.75%.

Exhibit 14.1
Astoria Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, have always followed the highest principles of business ethics in their dealings with Employees, customers, other persons with whom we do business and the general public. That is the reputation we now enjoy. It is the reputation we intend to keep.
To maintain this standard, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, the Board of Directors has adopted this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics formalizes the principles by which we have conducted business for many years. It is addressed to all Directors, Officers and Employees of Astoria Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. All such persons must certify that they have read this statement, understand our policies and their responsibilities concerning business conduct and are expected to conform to the requirements of this Code. Difficulties can generally be minimized or avoided entirely if individuals seek the assistance of the Director of Human Resources at the outset of a problem or concern.
No Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can replace the
A
thoughtful behavior of an ethical director, officer or employee.
@
1
 
It can, however, focus our attention on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to our personnel, provide a mechanism to report unethical behavior and further our culture of honesty and integrity. By reading this policy carefully and understanding and following its directives, we are confident that Astoria can maintain its valued reputation for the highest standards of business ethics.
As used throughout this Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the term
A
Astoria
@
refers to Astoria Financial Corporation and all of its subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association and its subsidiaries.

Astoria Financial Corporation
=
s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the
A
Code

) can be summarized as follows: Directors, Officers and Employees are all expected to act with the utmost integrity. No Director, Officer, or Employee is to personally gain, either directly or indirectly, from the initiation of any transaction involving Astoria Financial Corporation (
A
Astoria
@
). All Directors, Officers and Employees are expected to avoid conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest. All Directors, Officers and Employees owe Astoria a duty of loyalty. This means that the well being of Astoria, and not the personal gain of the individual Director, Officer or Employee, must be utmost in our minds in connection with all business transactions.
We will treat others, whether they are customers, shareholders, other Directors, Officers or Employees, or members of the public in a professional, businesslike manner, with respect and courtesy. Our Directors, Officers and Employees shall deal fairly with our customers, suppliers, competitors and each other. No Director, Officer or Employee shall take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged, confidential or proprietary information, misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair-dealing practice.
Maintaining our high level of ethics and integrity dictates that we do not accept customers or suppliers who are themselves unethical. If we have doubts about the standards of an individual, we will decline to do business with that individual rather than risk damage to our reputation.

Any gift which is prohibited under this Code must be refused or returned by a Director, Officer or Employee to whom it is offered or by whom it is received. The Director, Officer or Employee should take the opportunity to tactfully, but clearly, communicate Astoria
=
s policy prohibiting its Directors, Officers or Employees from accepting such gifts from customers or suppliers. All such offers and returns of such gifts, excluding those relating to Directors or Executive Officers, must be reported in writing to your Department or Division Head and the Director of Human Resources. All such offers and returns of such gifts involving Executive Officers, excluding the Chief Executive Officer, shall be reported to the Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Human Resources. All such offers and returns of such gifts involving the Directors or the Chief Executive Officer shall be reported to the Compensation Committee and the General Counsel.
 
15
If a gift is received which is improper, but which is impractical or awkward to return, the gift should be reported to the Director of Human Resources, who will direct that the gift will be donated, without tax deduction, to a charitable organization selected by Astoria. The supplier or customer that presented the gift will be notified of the donation.
It is important to note that the above rules apply even though a Director, Officer or Employee actually receives the thing of value after terminating service or employment with Astoria.
There are a number of instances where a Director, an Officer or Employee without risk of corruption or breach of trust, may accept things of value from someone doing or seeking to do business with the Association. Examples of activities which violate this Code or would be acceptable conduct are outlined below.
The following are examples of conduct that violate this Code:
Employee X solicits a payment from a real estate broker who wants to secure home mortgage loans from Astoria for his clients. Employee X tells the broker that the chances of his clients getting loans will be better if he makes the payment to Employee X.
Employee Y offers Astoria
=
s fee appraiser a monetary reward if the appraiser writes the appraisal on a piece of real estate in a certain way to ensure that Astoria will make the loan on the property.
Employee Z who negotiates contracts for Astoria with persons who supply material or services to Astoria accepts a substantial, excessive gift from a supplier. As a result of perception, the frequent acceptance of small
de minimus
gifts may also give rise to a problem. In this regard, it is expected that prudent judgment will be exercised at all times.
On the other hand, a Director, Officer or Employee of Astoria may:
 
16
Federal law and our internal policies requires Astoria to conduct its affairs in conformity with federal and applicable state statutes, laws, rules and regulations, including the regulations promulgated by the applicable Federal banking agencies. Astoria is further required to maintain complete and accurate records, and to periodically report on its condition to the applicable regulators.
It is Astoria
=
s policy to obey both foreign and domestic tax laws and foreign exchange control laws. No Director, Officer or Employee shall on behalf of Astoria enter into any transaction that such individual knows or reasonably should know would violate such laws.
Neither Astoria nor its Directors, Officers or Employees should assist any third party in violating the laws of any country. This policy applies whether or not the Astoria
=
s assistance itself violates the laws of any country.
Federal law prohibits Astoria from disclosing information regarding its customers except in limited circumstances and requires Astoria to maintain security measures to safeguard such information. No Director, Officer or Employee may use or disclose customer information except as permitted by Astoria
=
s Privacy Policy and Information Security Policy.
The Director of Human Resources is responsible for enforcing compliance with this Code. The Director of Human Resources and the Director of Internal Audit Services will conduct reviews to ensure compliance with this Code by Directors, Officers and Employees.
Violation of this Code by Directors, Officers, Employees and Affiliated Persons are matters of the utmost concern. A Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person who compromises or violates the law or policies and procedures contained in this Code may be subject to disciplinary actions which include suspension, demotion or immediate termination for cause. Directors, Officers, Employees and Affiliated Persons may also be subject to civil and/or criminal prosecution. Corrective action or any other response to a breach of this Code with respect to an Officer or Employee of Astoria must be approved by the Director of Human Resources. Any corrective action or waiver involving a Director or Executive Officer shall be reported to and must be approved by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors of Astoria Financial Corporation and shall be promptly disclosed to the shareholders of Astoria.
 
17
The Code requires each Director, Officer or Employee to complete an Employee Acknowledgment and Disclosure Form and return it to the Director of Human Resources within five (5) business days of the Director
=
s, Officer
=
s or Employee
=
s receipt of the Code. Subsequent Employee Acknowledgment and Disclosure Forms will be filed annually on or about July 31st of each year. Directors, Officers and Employees must disclose on the Annual Acknowledgement Form whether they have been convicted of certain criminal offenses. If during the course of the year, a Director, Officer or Employee is convicted of any such criminal offenses, he/she must disclose such fact immediately to the Director of Human Resources.
A Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person has a duty to identify and eliminate conflicts of interest and the appearance of such conflicts as they arise in the course of their service to or employment with Astoria. An Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person must disclose conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts to the Director of Human Resources. Directors, the Executive Officers, including the Chief Executive Officer, shall also disclose conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts to the Board of Directors and the Director of Internal Audit Services.
If a Director, Officer, Employee or Affiliated Person is not sure that a conflict of interest exits, but suspects there may be one, or that an appearance of a conflict of interest exists or could arise, the Director, Officer, or Affiliated Person should disclose such instances to the Director of Human Resources or, if applicable, the Board of Directors and the Director of Internal Audit Services.
A Director, Officer or Employee who may experience a direct or indirect benefit in connection with a matter before the Board of Directors has a conflict of interest and, therefore, would breach his or her fiduciary duties if he or she fails to disclose to the Board of Directors all material, non-privileged information relevant to the Board
=
s deliberations with respect to the matter.
Such Director, Officer or Employee must disclose at a minimum the following information:
 
18
Such Director, Officer or Employee must also refrain from participating in the Boards discussion of the matter or transaction and, if a Director, recuse him/herself from voting on the matter or transaction.
Information about any known or suspected violations of any provision of this Code on the part of any Director, Officer, Employee, Affiliated Person, customer, independent agent, adjuster, appraiser, supplier or vendor should be reported immediately to the Director of Human Resources. Astoria shall neither impose penalties nor take any retaliatory actions against any Officer or Employee who reports violations or suspected violations as long as the Officer or Employee has not personally committed or assisted in the commission of a violation.
No action, including the acceptance of restitution, should be taken against or on behalf of any Officer or Employee suspected of committing fraud, a dishonest act or unethical conduct without prior review by the Director of Human Resources. No final action, including the acceptance of restitution, should be taken against or on behalf of any Director or Executive Officer suspected of committing fraud, a dishonest act or unethical conduct without prior review by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Directors, Officers and Employees are required to cooperate with all conflict of interest or business conduct investigations carried out by Astoria. Requests for information by law enforcement officials should be immediately referred to the attention of the Director of Security.
Federal law stipulates that Executive Officers, Directors and Principal Shareholders (controlling persons) must report their Related Interests annually. Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association will maintain records which identify all Directors and Officers and their Related Interests.
Pursuant to Federal law, a Director or Officer, on behalf of Astoria Federal, must report crimes, suspected crimes, or unexplained losses (
A
suspicious activity
@
) encountered in the performance his or her duties. Such reports should be made to the Director of Security. The Director of Security shall investigate such activity and determine whether the filing of a Suspicious Activity Report is required or advisable. In the event the Director of Security is suspected of being involved in the violation(s), the report should be made to the Director of Internal Audit Services. Federal law further stipulates that Astoria Federal has an obligation to report violations to both the appropriate law enforcement authorities and the OTS.
 
19
Any Suspicious Activity Report must be submitted to a committee consisting of Mr. Gerard C. Keegan, Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer and Mr. Alan P. Eggleston, Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel, both of whom are Executive Officers. If they deem the suspicious activity appropriate for review by the Board of Directors, they shall report the matter to the Board of Directors.
While this Code provides that reporting violations or suspected violations of this Code will not result in disciplinary or retaliatory action against the reporting person unless that person has themselves violated or assisted in violating this Code, Astoria recognizes that Officers or Employees may still be reluctant to step forward, even if it is their duty to do so. In an effort to alleviate these concerns, Astoria has retained the services of Shareholder.Com to provide to Officers and Employees a method to confidentially report violations or suspected violations of this Code or otherwise communicate concerns to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board.
Officers and Employees can leave confidential messages with Shareholder.Com by calling 866-886-1349, by e-mail at

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Lake Success, New York, July 16, 2008
 
--
Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), today reported net income of $33.5 million, or $0.37 diluted earnings per share (EPS), for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, compared to $34.1 million, or $0.37 EPS, for the 2007 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net income totaled $62.4 million, or $0.69 EPS, compared to $69.8 million, or $0.75 EPS, for the comparable 2007 period.
 
Second Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights:
 
Commenting on the 2008 second quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, We are pleased to report solid second quarter results which reflect double-digit increases in both earnings and earnings per share over the 2008 first quarter. As anticipated, these very positive results were achieved due to a significant improvement in the net interest margin, resulting primarily from lower liability costs, solid loan and deposit growth and lower premium amortization expense. We expect continued expansion in the net interest margin, as well as loan and deposit growth.
 
1
 
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.26 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 16, 2008 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per common share. The dividend is payable on September 2, 2008 to shareholders of record as of August 15, 2008. This is the fifty-third consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
 
Second Quarter and Six Month Earnings Summary
Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 increased $11.8 million, or 15%, from the 2008 first quarter and $9.7 million, or 12%, from the 2007 second quarter to $92.6 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, net interest income increased $2.9 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2007, to $173.4 million.
 
Astorias net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 increased 24 basis points from the 2008 first quarter and 19 basis points from the 2007 second quarter to 1.81%. The increases were primarily due to a decrease in the cost of interest bearing-liabilities. We expect that the net interest margin will continue to expand this year, as we realize the repricing benefit of deposit and borrowing liabilities which have rates that are considerably above current market rates. Over the next six months, CDs (excluding Liquid CDs) totaling $3.7 billion, with a weighted average rate of 4.29%, and medium and long-term borrowings totaling $1.3 billion, with a weighted average rate of 4.95%, are scheduled to mature, Mr. Engelke noted.
 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2008, a $7.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded compared to $4.0 million for the previous quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, provision for loan losses totaled $11.0 million. No provision for loan losses was recorded in the comparable 2007 periods. Quarterly provisions for the remainder of 2008 are expected to remain at or increase somewhat from the second quarter level.
General and administrative expense (G&A) for the quarter ended June 30, 2008 increased $1.8 million, to $60.0 million, from the 2008 first quarter and $1.3 million from the 2007 second quarter. The linked quarter increase is primarily due to increases in advertising and goodwill litigation expense. The year over year increase is due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits and real estate owned (REO) expense, partially offset by lower goodwill litigation expense.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2008, G&A expense increased $2.4 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2007, to $118.2 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense.
 
Balance Sheet Summary
For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008, the total loan portfolio increased $478.8 million and $25.4 million, respectively, to $16.2 billion. The loan growth was funded primarily with excess liquidity and, to a lesser extent, retail deposits and wholesale borrowings. Total loan production for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008 increased to $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, from $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2007 periods.

For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008, the one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio increased $550.4 million and $197.7 million, respectively, to $11.8 billion. One-to-four family loan originations and purchases for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008 increased to $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, from $1.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2007 periods. One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008 totaled $821.3 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, compared to $583.1 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2007 periods.
 
Indicative of Astorias conservative underwriting standards, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the 2008 second quarter and six month one-to-four family loan production for portfolio averaged approximately 57% for each period and the loan amounts averaged approximately $690,000 and $675,000, respectively. It is important to note that the double-digit linked quarter loan growth attained in the second quarter has been achieved without sacrificing asset quality, as reflected in the very low average LTV ratio on second quarter loan production, Mr. Engelke noted.
 
For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008, the multi-family and commercial real estate (CRE) loan portfolio decreased $60.1 million and $132.0 million, respectively. Multi-family/CRE loan originations totaled $126.6 million and $193.8 million, for the respective three and six month periods ended June 30, 2008. At June 30, 2008, the combined multi-family and CRE loan portfolio totaled $3.8 billion, or 24% of total loans.
 
The loan-to-value ratio of the 2008 second quarter and six-month multi-family/CRE loan production averaged approximately 62% for each period and the loan amounts averaged approximately $2.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively.
 
Asset Quality
Asset quality continued to remain strong during the 2008 second quarter. Non-performing loans (NPL) totaled $128.6 million at June 30, 2008, an increase of $22.0 million from the previous quarter, and represent just 0.59% of total assets. At June 30, 2008, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $101.0 million and multi-family/CRE non-performing loans totaled $24.5 million, compared to $88.4 million and $14.9 million, respectively, at March 31, 2008.

The table below details, as of June 30, 2008, the states with a total of 1% or more of our one-to four-family loan portfolio and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states:
 
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008 totaled $5.2 million and $8.1 million, respectively, compared to net loan charge-offs of $698,000 and $543,000, respectively, for the 2007 comparable periods. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008, one-to-four family net loan charge-offs totaled $3.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively.
 
Commenting on asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, Although we have never actively participated in high-risk sub-prime residential lending, as a geographically diversified residential lender, we are not immune to the negative consequences arising from overall economic weakness and, in particular, a sharp downturn in the housing industry nationally. As expected, non-performing loans and charge-offs increased somewhat in the second quarter. However, the growth in non-performing loans has slowed from the previous quarter and importantly the trend in 30-59 day loan delinquencies has been relatively stable and down slightly over the past two quarters, as reflected in the delinquency chart on the previous page. Our overall asset quality remains strong, with non-performing loans representing just 59 basis points of total assets.
 
Balance Sheet Summary (Continued)
Deposits increased $85.5 and $39.6 million for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2008 and totaled $13.1 billion. Total assets increased $165.9 million from the previous quarter to $21.6 billion at June 30, 2008.

The following table illustrates the above improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
 
Twelfth Stock Repurchase Program Continues
During the 2008 second quarter, Astoria repurchased 300,000 shares of its common stock at an average cost of $23.96 per share. During the six month period ended June 30, 2008, Astoria repurchased a total of 590,000 shares at an average cost of $24.74. Under the current stock repurchase program, 8.3 million shares remain available for repurchase as of June 30, 2008.
 
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.66% of total assets at June 30, 2008. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.63%, 6.63% and 12.17%, respectively, at June 30, 2008.
 
Future Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2008, Mr. Engelke stated, We continue to anticipate a positively sloped yield curve throughout the year which will provide opportunities for significant earnings growth and the continued expansion of our net interest margin. In addition, we expect both loan and deposit growth will continue, particularly since we are experiencing more rational deposit pricing in our market. Although we expect our credit costs will continue to trend somewhat higher, such increases will be more than offset by margin expansion. The Companys tangible capital ratio target remains between 4.50% and 4.75%.

These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following: the timing and occurrence or
non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control; there may be increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins or affect the value of our investments; changes in deposit flows, loan demand or real estate values may adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines may cause our financial condition to be perceived differently; general economic conditions, either nationally or locally in some or all other areas in which we do business, or conditions in the real estate or securities markets or the banking industry may be less favorable than we currently anticipate; legislative or regulatory changes may adversely affect our business; applicable technological changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; success or consummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; or litigation or matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, may be determined adverse to us or may delay occurrence or non-occurrence of events longer than we anticipate.

Other Events.
 
On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a plan to place Freddie Mac under conservatorship under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). As of June 30, 2008, Astoria Financial Corporation (the Company) owned two preferred securities issued by Freddie Mac, Series H, 5.10% par value $100 million and Series L, 3.58% par value $20 million, with a combined adjusted book value of $83.7 million. The estimated fair market value of these available-for-sale securities has declined significantly from June 30, 2008. Based on the recent actions by the U.S. Treasury, it is likely that the decrease in fair market value will result in an other-than-temporary impairment non-cash charge recognized for the quarter ending September 30, 2008. The non-cash after-tax charge would have minimal impact on the Companys capital position which would continue to remain within its capital target range of between 4.50% and 4.75%. The Companys banking subsidiary, Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association, would continue to remain well capitalized with regulatory core and tangible capital in excess of 6%.
 
Additionally, the FHFA has suspended dividend payments on the preferred stock of Freddie Mac which, for the Company, totals approximately $5.8 million, pre-tax, annually.

Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), today reported a net loss of $16.5 million (operating income of $41.4 million), or $0.18 diluted loss per share (operating earnings per share (EPS) of $0.46), for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 compared to net income of $35.3 million, or $0.39 EPS, for the 2007 third quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net income totaled $45.9 million (operating income of $103.8 million), or $0.51 diluted earnings per share (operating EPS of $1.14), compared to $105.1 million, or $1.14 EPS, for the comparable 2007 period.
Included in the third quarter and nine month 2008 results is an other-than-temporary impairment, after-tax, non-cash charge (OTTI), of $57.9 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, relating to Freddie Mac preferred stock. The OTTI reduced the carrying amount of two perpetual preferred stock issues of Freddie Mac to a combined market value of $5.3 million at September 30, 2008. The tax benefit recognized on the OTTI was based on the treatment of the OTTI as a capital loss, which limited the tax benefit to the Company. Subsequently, on October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act was enacted which includes a provision permitting banks to recognize OTTI charges relating to Freddie Mac preferred stock as an ordinary loss, increasing the tax benefit to the Company. Had the Company recognized the OTTI as an ordinary loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the OTTI recorded would have been $50.5 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. The Company will recognize the additional tax benefit in the quarter ending December 31, 2008 totaling approximately $7.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. The perpetual preferred stock issues are held in the Companys available-for-sale securities portfolio. Prior to this charge, impairment was recorded as an unrealized mark-to-market loss on securities available-for-sale and reflected as a reduction to equity through other comprehensive income. Operating income and operating EPS, representing net income and EPS determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) excluding the effects of the after-tax, non-cash OTTI charge noted above, provide a more meaningful comparison for effectively evaluating Astorias operating results. For a reconciliation of operating income and operating EPS to GAAP net income and EPS, please refer to the table on page 14.
 
Third Quarter 2008 Financial Highlights:
Commenting on the 2008 third quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted, We are pleased with the solid fundamental operating results achieved in the third quarter, despite the continued deterioration of the national housing market. The positive operating results are due to lower liability costs, solid quality loan growth and an increase in retail deposits. As we anticipated, our non-performing loans and delinquencies increased, however, significant margin improvement helped mitigate the impact of the increases.
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.26 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 15, 2008 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2008 to shareholders of record as of November 17, 2008. This is the fifty-fourth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Third Quarter and Nine Month Earnings Summary
Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 increased $14.5 million, or 16%, from the 2008 second quarter and $25.9 million, or 32%, from the 2007 third quarter to $107.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, net interest income increased $28.8 million, or 11%, from the comparable 2007 period, to $280.4 million.

Astorias net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 increased to 2.06%, 25 basis points above the 2008 second quarter and 48 basis points above the 2007 third quarter. The increases were primarily due to decreases in the cost of interest bearing-liabilities. During the 2008 third quarter, $2.3 billion of CDs (excluding Liquid CDs), with a weighted average rate of 4.25%, matured and $2.6 billion of CDs were issued or repriced with a weighted average rate of 3.64%. During the 2008 fourth quarter, CDs (excluding Liquid CDs) totaling $1.7 billion, with a weighted average rate of 4.11% are scheduled to mature.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2008, a $13.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded compared to $7.0 million for the previous quarter and $500,000 for the 2007 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, the provision for loan losses totaled $24.0 million compared to $500,000 for the comparable 2007 period. The increases recognize the rise in non-performing loans against a backdrop of continued deterioration in the housing market and weakness in the overall economy as well as the Companys loan growth. The provision for the 2008 fourth quarter is expected to remain at or increase somewhat from the 2008 third quarter provision.
Non-interest income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 included a $77.7 million pre-tax OTTI. Excluding the OTTI, non-interest income totaled $22.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 compared to $24.8 million for the comparable 2007 period. The decrease is primarily due to a gain on the sale of an equity security position recorded in the 2007 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, non interest income totaled $69.7 million, excluding the OTTI, compared to $73.7 million for the comparable 2007 period. The decrease is primarily due to the aforementioned gain on sale and the receipt of insurance proceeds in 2007.
General and administrative expense (G&A) for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 decreased $1.2 million, to $58.8 million, from the 2008 second quarter and increased $2.3 million from the 2007 third quarter. The linked quarter decrease is primarily due to lower compensation and benefits expense and other expense, including lower goodwill litigation expense, partially offset by increased advertising expense. The year over year increase is due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits expense and advertising expense.
 
Page 3
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, G&A expense increased $4.6 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2007, to $177.0 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense and REO expense, partially offset by a decrease in goodwill litigation expense.
The operating effective tax rate, which excludes the tax benefit related to the OTTI, was reduced to approximately 28% for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 due to the release of accruals for previous tax positions that statutorily expired. It is expected that the fourth quarter operating effective tax rate will return to a more normal level of approximately 34%.
Balance Sheet Summary
For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008, the total loan portfolio increased $542.4 million and $567.7 million, respectively, to $16.7 billion. The loan growth was funded primarily with wholesale borrowings and, to a lesser extent, retail deposits. Total loan production for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased to $1.3 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, from $1.1 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2007 periods.
For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008, the one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio increased $533.3 million and $731.0 million, respectively, to $12.4 billion. One-to-four family loan originations and purchases for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 increased 19% and 11%, respectively, to $1.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, from $982.0 million and $3.0 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2007 periods. One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 totaled $516.9 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, compared to $430.4 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2007 periods. Indicative of Astorias conservative underwriting standards, the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the 2008 third quarter one-to-four family loan production for portfolio averaged approximately 58%. The loan amounts averaged approximately $680,000.
 
Page 4
For the quarter ended September 30, 2008, the multi-family and commercial real estate (CRE) loan portfolio increased $9.7 million and for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 decreased $122.4 million. Multi-family and CRE loan originations totaled $154.1 million and $347.9 million, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared to $90.5 million and $344.4 million for the comparable 2007 periods. At September 30, 2008, the combined multi-family and CRE loan portfolio totaled $3.9 billion, or 23% of total loans. The loan-to-value ratio of the 2008 third quarter combined multi-family and CRE loan production averaged approximately 52% and the loan amounts averaged approximately $2.0 million.
It is important to note that the double-digit increase in total loan production has been achieved without sacrificing asset quality, as reflected in the very low average LTV ratios, Mr. Engelke noted.
Asset Quality
Despite the increase in non-performing loans, overall asset quality remains strong. Non-performing loans (NPL) totaled $164.8 million at September 30, 2008, an increase of $36.2 million from the previous quarter, and represent just 0.74% of total assets. At September 30, 2008, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $126.9 million and multi-family/CRE non-performing loans totaled $33.6 million, compared to $101.0 million and $24.5 million, respectively, at June 30, 2008.
The comparative table below illustrates loan migration from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:
 
 
The table below details, as of September 30, 2008, the states with a total of 1% or more of our one-to- four family loan portfolio and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states:
 
Page 5
 
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 totaled $8.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively, compared to net loan charge-offs of $1.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively, for the 2007 comparable periods. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008, one-to-four family net loan charge-offs totaled $5.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively.
Commenting on asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, Although we have never actively participated in high-risk sub-prime residential lending, as a geographically diversified residential lender, we are not immune to the negative consequences arising from overall economic weakness and, in particular, the deterioration in the housing industry nationally. As expected, non-performing loans and charge-offs increased in the third quarter, however our overall asset quality remains strong, with non-performing loans representing just 74 basis points of total assets. We expect that non-performing loans and charge-offs will continue to increase as the housing market continues to decline and overall economic weakness persists but should, nonetheless, remain at manageable levels.

Balance Sheet Summary (Continued)
Deposits increased $20.1 million and $59.7 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 and totaled $13.1 billion. Total assets increased $553.4 million and $454.1 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008 and totaled $22.2 billion.
Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Companys balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
 
 
 
The following table illustrates the above improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
 
 
 
Page 7
 
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.37% of total assets at September 30, 2008. Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.16%, 6.16 % and 11.43%, respectively, at September 30, 2008.
Future Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2008, Mr. Engelke stated, We expect the net interest margin will continue to increase in the fourth quarter as we realize the full benefit from liabilities which repriced lower in the third quarter and the additional benefit from lower deposit costs in the fourth quarter and modest earning asset growth. With respect to asset quality, as the housing crisis continues and the economy remains weak with job losses increasing, the challenges facing residential lenders will continue. Accordingly, we expect our non-performing assets and loan delinquencies will increase somewhat in the 2008 fourth quarter but should, nonetheless, remain at manageable levels. The Companys tangible capital ratio target remains between 4.50% and 4.75%.

We expect the net interest margin will continue to increase in the fourth quarter along with modest earning asset growth. We expect our non-performing assets and loan delinquencies will increase somewhat in the 2008 fourth quarter, but should remain at manageable levels.

On November 14, 2008, Astoria Financial Corporation (Astoria), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), filed an application with the Office of Thrift Supervision for the sale of $375 million in preferred stock and related warrants to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program (the Program) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Although Astoria is considering participating in the Program to further strengthen its capital base, it does not believe that participation in the Program is necessary for Astoria Federal to maintain its well-capitalized status since capital levels exceed all regulatory requirements. Although the application to participate in the Program has been filed, if it is approved, there is no assurance that Astoria will participate in the program.

As of September 30, 2008, Astoria Federals capital ratios were in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.16%, 6.16% and 11.43%, respectively.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
   
ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER EPS OF $0.33
Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal, the Bank), today reported net income of $29.4 million, or $0.33 diluted earnings per share (EPS), (operating income of $22.1 million, or $0.24 operating EPS), for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 compared to $19.7  million, or $0.22 EPS, (operating income of $33.0 million, or $0.36 operating EPS), for the 2007 fourth quarter.
Lake Success, New York, January 28, 2009

For the year ended December 31, 2008, net income totaled $75.3 million, or $0.83 EPS, (operating income of $125.8 million, or $1.39 operating EPS) compared to $124.8 million, or $1.36 EPS, (operating income of $138.1 million, or $1.50 operating EPS) for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Operating income and operating EPS, representing net income and EPS determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) excluding the effects of the after-tax, non-cash OTTI charges, provide a meaningful comparison for effectively evaluating Astorias operating results.  For a reconciliation of operating income and operating EPS to GAAP net income and EPS, please refer to the tables on page 14.
 
 
______________________________
 
 
 
 
1
Commenting on the quarter and full year results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted We are pleased with the fundamental operating performance of Astoria during the fourth quarter and the year, including an improvement in net interest income and the net interest margin.  Unfortunately, these improvements were achieved against a backdrop of a severely deteriorating economy including continued and growing weakness in the national housing market which negatively impacted our overall results. During the fourth quarter, job losses accelerated more rapidly than expected, resulting in higher loan delinquencies, foreclosures, credit costs and loan loss provisions.
 
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
 
 Based on fourth quarter operating EPS and in light of continued economic uncertainty, the Board of Directors of the Company, at their January 28, 2009 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share.  The dividend is payable on March 2, 2009 to shareholders of record as of February 17, 2009.  This represents the fifty-fifth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.  Commenting on the dividend action, Mr. Engelke stated, The decision to reduce the quarterly cash dividend is based on, among other things, the dividend payout ratio coupled with our desire to retain capital during this challenging economic environment.
 
Board Sets Annual Shareholders Meeting Date
 
The Board of Directors, at their January 28, 2009 meeting, established May 20, 2009 as the date for the Astoria Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a voting record date of March 23, 2009.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary
 
Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 increased $7.9 million, or 7.4%, from the 2008 third quarter, and $33.0 million, or 40.3%, from the 2007 fourth quarter to $114.9 million.  For the year ended December 31, 2008, net interest income increased $61.9 million, or 18.5%, from December 31, 2007 to $395.4 million.
 
Astorias net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 increased to 2.18%, 12 basis points above the 2008 third quarter and 61 basis points above the quarter ended December 31, 2007.   The interest rate spread for the 2008 fourth quarter increased to 2.08% from 1.96% for the 2008 third quarter and from 1.45% for the 2007 fourth quarter.  The increases were primarily due to decreases in the cost of interest bearing-liabilities.  During the 2008 fourth quarter, $1.8 billion of CDs (excluding Liquid CDs), with a weighted average rate of 4.07%, matured and $2.2 billion of CDs were issued or repriced with a weighted average rate of 3.59%.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2008, the net interest margin increased to 1.91% from 1.62% for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declining more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2008, a $45.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded compared to $13.0 million for the previous quarter and $2.0 million for the 2007 fourth quarter.  For the year ended December 31, 2008, the provisions for loan losses totaled $69.0 million compared to $2.5 million for 2007.  Commenting on the increased provision during 2008, Mr. Engelke noted, The increase recognizes the rise in loan delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs directly related to the continued deterioration in the housing market and increasing weakness in the overall economy, particularly, the accelerating pace of job losses.
 
2
Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 totaled $19.2 million compared to $22.6 million, excluding a pre-tax OTTI non-cash charge of $20.5 million, for the comparable 2007 period.   For  the year ended December 31, 2008, non-interest income totaled $88.9 million, excluding a pre-tax OTTI non-cash charge of $77.7 million, compared to $96.3 million for the comparable 2007 period, excluding the aforementioned OTTI charge recorded in the 2007 fourth quarter.
 
General and administrative expense (G&A) for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 declined $2.6 million from the 2008 third quarter, and $2.7 million from the 2007 fourth quarter, to $56.2 million.  The linked quarter decrease is primarily due to decreased compensation and benefits expense and the year over year decrease is due to lower compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by increased advertising expense.   For the year ended December 31, 2008, G&A increased just $2.0 million from 2007, or less than 1%, to $233.3 million.
 
Balance Sheet Summary
 
For the 2008 fourth quarter, the loan portfolio remained essentially flat from the prior quarter and increased $557.4 million, or 3.5%, from December 31, 2007 and totaled $16.7 billion at December 31, 2008. Mortgage loan originations and purchases totaled $616.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 compared to $882.1 million for the 2007 fourth quarter.

For the 2008 fourth quarter, the one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio remained relatively flat from the prior quarter and increased $721.3 million, or 6.2%, from December 31, 2007 and totaled $12.3 billion at December 31, 2008.  One-to-four family loan originations and purchases totaled $449.9 million for the 2008 fourth quarter compared to $816.1 million for the 2007 fourth quarter.
 
One-to-four family loan originations and purchases totaled $3.8 billion for both of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.  The loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of the 2008 one-to-four family loan production for portfolio averaged 57% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $675,000.
 
For the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the multi-family and commercial real estate (CRE) loan portfolio remained relatively flat from the prior quarter.  Loan originations totaled  $166.2 million compared to $66.0 million for the 2007 fourth quarter.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2008, multi-family and CRE loan originations totaled $514.2 million compared to $410.4 million for 2007.  At December 31, 2008, the combined multi-family and CRE loan portfolio totaled $3.9 billion, or 23% of total loans.

Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Companys balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
 
The following table illustrates this improvement on an outstanding per share basis:
 
 
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.38% of total assets at December 31, 2008.  Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.39%, 6.39% and 12.02%, respectively, at December 31, 2008.
 
Asset Quality
 
Despite the increase in non-performing loans, overall asset quality remains strong.  Non-performing loans (NPL) totaled $238.6 million at December 31, 2008, an increase of $73.8 million from the previous quarter, and represent 1.09% of total assets.  At December 31, 2008, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $177.5 million and multi-family/CRE non-performing loans totaled $51.1 million, compared to $126.9 million and $33.6 million, respectively, at September 30, 2008.
 
The comparative table below illustrates loan migration from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:

The table below details, as of December 31, 2008, the states with a total of 1% or more of our one-to- four family loan portfolio and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states:
 
 
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008 totaled $12.3 million and $28.9 million, respectively, compared to $1.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, for the comparable 2007 periods.  For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008, one-to-four family net loan charge-offs totaled $6.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively, compared to $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the comparable 2007 periods.  Commenting on asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, As a residential lender, we are vulnerable to the impact of a severe job loss recession.  The significant increase in job losses and unemployment in the 2008 fourth quarter had a negative impact on the financial condition of prime residential borrowers and their ability to remain current on their mortgage loans.
 
Company Declines to Participate in the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program
 
           Astoria Financial Corporation has elected not to participate in the U.S. Treasurys Capital Purchase Program (CPP)after fully evaluating the related costs and benefits, as well as the potential impact on the long-term value of its shares.  The Company disclosed on December 8, 2008 that it had received preliminary approval to issue up to $375 million of preferred stock and related warrants to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP.  Commenting on the Companys decision, Mr. Engelke stated, Based on the well-capitalized position of the Bank, with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.39%, 6.39%, and 12.02%, respectively, the Board determined that the CPP would provide no material benefit to our shareholders and therefore, it would be in our shareholders best interests to decline the opportunity to participate.
 
 
5
Future Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for 2009, Mr. Engelke stated, The year ahead presents us with both opportunities and challenges.  With respect to our fundamental operating performance, we expect that loan growth will continue in 2009 as the opportunity for portfolio lending remains strong.  Tighter underwriting standards coupled with wider spreads present us with an opportunity to increase the loan portfolio with top quality loans.   We expect deposit growth in 2009 will continue, particularly as the intense competition for core community deposits in 2008 has recently abated.
 
Industry-wide increases in pension costs and FDIC insurance premiums coupled with potentially reduced dividends on Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock will reduce 2009 earnings.  Additionally, continued weakness in the real estate market exacerbated by a severe downturn in the economy presents challenges for all financial institutions in the year ahead.  Although our mortgage loan delinquencies and foreclosures have increased, the portfolio remains strong, with non-performing loans representing just 109 basis points of total assets.  However, continued job losses coupled with declining real estate values will put increased pressure on the loan portfolio which, more than likely, will result in higher delinquencies and non-performing loans in 2009.
 
The Company expects to maintain its tangible capital ratio target at between 4.50% and 4.75% and the Banks core and tangible ratios in excess of 6%.  In addition, as a part of its capital management, the Company expects to consider alternatives, such as the offer and sale of equity or debt securities, subject to market conditions and the Companys capital needs.
 
 Astoria Financial Corporation, with assets of $22.0 billion, is the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association.

Forward Looking Statement
This presentation may contain a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Forward-looking statements are based on various assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our management's experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors (many of which are beyond our control) that could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  These factors include, without limitation, the following: the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control; there may be increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins or affect the value of our investments; changes in deposit flows, loan demand or real estate values may adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines may cause our financial condition to be perceived differently; general economic conditions, either nationally or locally in some or all areas in which we do business, or conditions in the real estate or securities markets or the banking industry may be less favorable than we currently anticipate; legislative or regulatory changes may adversely affect our business; applicable technological changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; success or consummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; or litigation or matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, may be determined adverse to us or may delay occurrence or non-occurrence of events longer than we anticipate.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), today reported net income of $8.8 million (operating income of $12.2 million), or $0.10 diluted earnings per share (EPS) (operating earnings per share of $0.14 (operating EPS)), for the quarter ended March 31, 2009, compared to $28.9 million, or $0.32 EPS, for the 2008 first quarter.
Lake Success, New York  April 22, 2009 
 
Included in the 2009 first quarter results is an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI), after-tax, non-cash charge of $3.4 million, or $0.04 EPS, to write-off the remaining cost basis of our investment in Freddie Mac preferred stock.  Operating income and operating EPS, representing net income and EPS determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) excluding the effects of the OTTI charge, provide a meaningful comparison for effectively evaluating Astorias operating results.  For a reconciliation of operating income and operating EPS to GAAP net income and EPS, please refer to the table on page 12.
 
Commenting on the first quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, The challenging operating environment continued to negatively impact our operating results.  As anticipated, higher unemployment and continued weakness in the national housing market resulted in increases in loan delinquencies, foreclosures, credit costs and loan loss provision.  It is important to note, however, that the first quarter year-over-year operating results reflected significant increases in both net interest income and the net interest margin.
 
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
 
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their April 22, 2009 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share.  The dividend is payable on June 1, 2009 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2009.  This is the fifty-sixth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.

First Quarter 2009 Earnings Summary
 
Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 increased 38% to $111.7 million from $80.8 million for the 2008 first quarter and declined $3.3 million, or 3%, from the 2008 fourth quarter. Astorias net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 increased 59 basis points to 2.16% from 1.57% for the 2008 first quarter and declined two basis points from the 2008 fourth quarter.  The year-over-year increase in the margin was due to the cost of liabilities declining more rapidly than the yield on interest earning assets.  The slight decline in the margin on a linked quarter basis was due to an increase in borrowing costs of 17 basis points resulting from the repayment of low-cost short-term borrowings, offset almost entirely by the increase in the average balance of deposits of $396.6 million and a 15 basis point decrease in the cost of deposits.
 
We expect that the net interest margin will resume expansion in the second quarter, as we increasingly realize the benefit of the repricing of maturing non-Liquid CDs that have interest rates considerably above current market rates.  Non-Liquid CDs totaling $1.8 billion and $2.9 billion are scheduled to mature in the 2009 second quarter and second half, respectively, with weighted average rates of 3.49% and 3.59%, respectively.  By comparison, in the 2009 first quarter, $2.3 billion of non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced at a weighted average rate of 2.45%, while non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced in March at a weighted rate of 1.88%, considerably lower than the average for the first quarter, Mr. Engelke noted.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, a $50.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded compared to $45.0 million for the previous quarter and $4.0 million for the 2008 first quarter.  Commenting on the 2009 first quarter provision, Mr. Engelke stated, The provision recorded in this years first quarter recognizes the increase in loan delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs directly related to the continued deterioration in the housing market and increasing weakness in the economy, particularly, the accelerating pace of job losses.
 
Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 totaled $21.2 million, excluding the pre-tax OTTI  charge of $5.3 million, compared to $22.4 million for the 2008 first quarter.
 
General and administrative expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 increased $7.8 million to $64.0 million from $56.2 million for the 2008 fourth quarter and $5.8 million from $58.2 million for the 2008 first quarter.   The linked quarter and year-over-year increases were primarily due to $3.4 million and $3.3 million respective increases in FDIC premium expense and $3.1 million and $3.0 million respective increases in pension expense.
 
Balance Sheet Summary
 
For the 2009 first quarter, the loan portfolio declined $290.6 million from the previous quarter end to $16.4 billion at March 31, 2009.  The primary reason for the decline was lower loan originations and purchases for portfolio which totaled $391.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 compared to $588.9 million for the previous quarter.  In addition, loan prepayments increased to $523.0 million for the 2009 first quarter from $467.0 million for the previous quarter.

For the 2009 first quarter, the one-to-four family mortgage loan portfolio declined $192.3 million from the previous quarter end to $12.2 billion at March 31, 2009.   One-to-four family loan originations and purchases for portfolio totaled $382.5 million for the 2009 first quarter compared to $422.7 million for the previous quarter.  One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 totaled $457.1 million compared to $330.3 million for the 2008 fourth quarter.  The 2009 first quarter origination and purchase volume was negatively affected by significant fallout from our loan pipeline due to, among other things, the fact that potential borrowers are not qualifying under our strict underwriting guidelines, particularly with respect to loan-to-value ratios.  The loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2009 first quarter averaged 55% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $730,000.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, the multi-family/commercial real estate (CRE) loan portfolio decreased $94.7 million from the previous quarter to $3.8 billion at March 31, 2009.  The decrease was due to our decision to slow the pace of multi-family/CRE loan originations in the current economic climate.  First quarter 2009 multi-family/CRE loan originations totaled just $9.4 million compared to $166.2 million for the previous quarter.
 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, deposits increased $149.3 million, or 4.4% annualized, from the previous quarter to $13.6 billion.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, borrowings decreased $827.9 million from the previous quarter to $6.1 billion.  The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of short-term borrowings.  Total assets declined $577.3 million from the prior quarter to $21.4 billion at March 31, 2009.
 
Key balance sheet highlights, reflecting the improvement in the quality of the Companys balance sheet since December 31, 1999, follow:
 
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.61% of total assets at March 31, 2009.  Astoria Federal continues to maintain capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements with core, tangible and risk-based capital ratios of 6.55%, 6.55% and 12.45%, respectively, at March 31, 2009.
 
Asset Quality
 
Non-performing loans (NPL) totaled $336.6 million at March 31, 2009, an increase of $98.0 million from the previous quarter, and represent 1.57% of total assets.  At March 31, 2009, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $245.5 million and multi-family/CRE non-performing loans totaled $81.5 million compared to $177.5 million and $51.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008.
 
The comparative table below illustrates loan migration from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:

The table below details, as of March 31, 2009, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states.  More comprehensive state details are included on page 13.
 
 
(1)  Based on current principal balances and original appraised values.
(2)  Does not foot due to rounding.
(3)  Includes 30 states and Washington, DC.
 
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 totaled $19.8 million (of which $11.2 million represented one-to-four family loans and $7.9 million represented multi-family/CRE loans) compared to $12.3 million (of which $6.8 million represented one-to-four family loans and $5.1 million represented multi-family/CRE loans) for the 2008 fourth quarter.  Included in the $11.2 million of one-to-four family loan charge-offs are $5.5 million of charge-offs on $21.9 million of non-performing loans which, at 180 days delinquent, were adjusted to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs.  Commenting on asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, The continued deterioration in the economy, particularly rising unemployment, continues to strain the financial condition of prime residential borrowers and their ability to remain current on their mortgage loans and the ability of tenants in multi-family properties to pay rent on their apartments.  Accordingly, we experienced increases in non-performing loans, foreclosures and credit costs during the first quarter.  Importantly, loans delinquent 30-89 days increased only $21.7 million from the previous quarter, considerably less than the $40.2 million and $74.2 million increases recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2008, respectively.

Future Outlook
 
Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2009, Mr. Engelke stated, The year continues to present us with both opportunities and challenges.  Although we are encouraged by the slowing growth in 30-89 day delinquencies in the first quarter, we expect that job losses and economic weakness will continue to put pressure on borrowers which, more than likely, will result in somewhat higher delinquencies and non-performing loans, however, credit costs should remain manageable.
 
With respect to our fundamental operating performance, we expect deposit growth in 2009 will continue, particularly since the intense competition for core community deposits has diminished somewhat.  We also expect increases in net interest income and the net interest margin going forward as we begin to realize the benefit from significant CD deposits maturing throughout the year at rates that are considerably above current market rates.

These factors include, without limitation, the following: the timing and occurrence or non-occurrence of events may be subject to circumstances beyond our control; there may be increases in competitive pressure among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins or affect the value of our investments; changes in deposit flows, loan demand or real estate values may adversely affect our business; changes in accounting principles, policies or guidelines may cause our financial condition to be perceived differently; general economic conditions, either nationally or locally in some or all areas in which we do business, or conditions in the real estate or securities markets or the banking industry may be less favorable than we currently anticipate; legislative or regulatory changes may adversely affect our business; applicable technological changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; success or consummation of new business initiatives may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate; or litigation or matters before regulatory agencies, whether currently existing or commencing in the future, may be determined adverse to us or may delay occurrence or non-occurrence of events longer than we anticipate.  We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), today reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.03 diluted earnings per share (EPS), (operating income of $10.1 million, or  $0.11 operating EPS), for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, compared to $33.5 million, or $0.37 EPS for the comparable 2008 period.  For the six months ended June 30, 2009, net income totaled $11.5 million, or $0.12 EPS (operating income of $22.4 million, or $0.24 operating EPS), compared to $62.4 million, or $0.68 EPS, for the comparable 2008 period.
Lake Success, New York  July 22, 2009
 
Included in the 2009 second quarter results are two charges totaling $11.4 million ($7.4 million, or $0.08 EPS, after-tax), which are not routine to our core operations: the FDIC deposit insurance special assessment totaling $9.9 million and a $1.5 million lower of cost or market write-down on a former mortgage origination building held-for-sale (Mortgage building write-down).  Included in the six month period ended June 30, 2009, in addition to the aforementioned items, is an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI), non-cash charge of $5.3 million ($3.4 million, or $0.04 EPS, after-tax) reported in the 2009 first quarter, to write-off the remaining cost basis of our investment in Freddie Mac preferred stock.  Operating income and operating EPS, representing net income and EPS determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) excluding the after-tax effects of the FDIC deposit insurance special assessment, the OTTI charge and the Mortgage building write-down, are non-GAAP measures which provide a meaningful comparison for effectively evaluating Astorias operating results.  Operating income and operating EPS equaled net income and diluted EPS for the 2008 second quarter and six months.  Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures and non-GAAP measures table in this release.
Commenting on the second quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, On an operating basis, our year over year quarter and six month results were primarily affected by increased credit costs associated with the national recession and, on a linked quarter basis, from a reduction in interest earning assets resulting from shrinkage of the securities and loan portfolios due primarily to repayments in the second quarter, coupled with a lag in deploying excess liquidity.  During the second half of 2009, we expect to deploy the excess liquidity into higher yielding assets, which will have a positive impact on net income and the net interest margin.  Additionally, we expect problem assets to remain at manageable levels as we pro-actively address our non-performing loans.

Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 22, 2009 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share.  The dividend is payable on September 1, 2009 to shareholders of record as of August 17, 2009.  This is the fifty-seventh consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Second Quarter and Six Month Earnings Summary
  Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 increased to $109.1 million, or 18%, from $92.6 million for the 2008 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2009, net interest income increased to $220.7 million, or 27%, compared to $173.4 million for the comparable 2008 period.
The net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 was 2.16%, unchanged from the previous quarter and 35 basis points higher than 1.81% for the 2008 second quarter.  On a linked quarter basis, excess liquidity reduced the margin five basis points.  The year-over-year increase in the margin was due to the cost of liabilities declining more rapidly than the yield on interest earning assets.
We expect a resumption of net interest margin expansion in the third quarter, as we realize the  benefit from deploying excess liquidity into higher yielding assets coupled with the repricing benefit from maturing non-Liquid CDs with interest rates considerably above current market rates, which will be somewhat offset by a decline in asset yields.   Non-Liquid CDs totaling $3.2 billion are scheduled to mature in the 2009 second half, with a weighted average rate of 3.32%.   Non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced in June 2009 at a weighted average rate of 1.73%.  Further illustrating the pace of decline in deposit costs, the average cost of deposits for the second quarter was 2.42%, while the weighted average cost of deposits at quarter-end was 2.30%, Mr. Engelke noted.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, a $50.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded which was equal to the provision for the previous quarter and greater than the $7.0 million provision for the 2008 second quarter.  For the six months ended June 30, 2009, provision for loan losses totaled $100.0 million compared to $11.0 million for the comparable period in 2008.  Mr. Engelke noted, The 2009 provisions recognize the impact that the continued weakness in both the national housing market and the economy in general, particularly increasing unemployment, have had on our overall level of loan delinquencies and loan charge-offs.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 totaled $22.0 million, excluding the Mortgage building write-down, compared to $24.8 million for the 2008 second quarter.  For the six months ended June 30, 2009, non-interest income, excluding the Mortgage building write-down and the OTTI charge, totaled $43.3 million, compared to $47.3 million for the comparable 2008 period.
General and administrative (G&A) expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, excluding the FDIC special assessment, totaled $66.2 million compared to $60.0 million for the 2008 second quarter.  For the six months ended June 30, 2009, G&A expense totaled $130.1 million, excluding the FDIC special assessment, compared to $118.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2008.  The increases were due primarily to an increase in FDIC insurance premiums, beyond the FDIC special assessment, and compensation and benefits expense, primarily pension expense.

Balance Sheet Summary
The loan portfolio declined $449.0 million from the previous quarter and $739.5 million from December 31, 2008 and totaled $16.0 billion at June 30, 2009.  The primary reason for the declines were decreases of $262.2 million and $454.5 million, respectively, in the one-to-four family loan portfolio, primarily due to accelerated prepayment activity, as well as decreases of $171.5 million and $266.2 million, respectively, in the combined multi-family and commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio.  At June 30, 2009, the one-to-four family loan portfolio totaled $11.9 billion and the multi-family/CRE portfolio totaled $3.6 billion.
For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009, one-to-four family loan originations for portfolio totaled $668.5 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, compared to $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2008 periods.  One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2009 totaled $810.1 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, compared to $821.3 million and $1.7 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2008 periods.  The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2009 second quarter and six months each averaged 56% at origination and the loan amount each averaged approximately $720,000. Based on our decision at the end of March 2009 to more competitively price our 5/1 jumbo ARM and retain 15 year jumbo fixed-rate loans, our loan pipeline at June 30, 2009 increased 65% from the pipeline at March 31, 2009.   This was achieved   while maintaining our strict underwriting standards.
Deposits were relatively flat from the previous quarter and increased $130.3 million from December 31, 2008 to $13.6 billion at June 30, 2009.  Importantly, low-cost savings, money market and checking account deposits increased $93.8 million and $233.5 million for the 2009 second quarter and six months, respectively.  Commenting on deposit flows, Mr. Engelke noted, During the second quarter we reduced our focus on CD deposits and slowed deposit growth.  This was done to offset the impact of accelerated mortgage prepayment activity, which outpaced our loan production.  This notwithstanding, during the 2009 six month period, we achieved a 6.5% increase in low-cost savings, money market and checking deposits.
Borrowings decreased $249.9 million from the previous quarter and $1.1 billion from December 31, 2008 to $5.9 billion, at June 30, 2009.  Total assets declined $303.5 million from the prior quarter and $880.8 million from December 31, 2008 to $21.1 billion at June 30, 2009.
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 5.68% of total assets at June 30, 2009.  Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with core, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 6.62%, 6.62%, 12.73% and 11.46%, respectively, at June 30, 2009.
Asset Quality
Non-performing loans (NPL), including troubled debt restructurings (TDR) of $47.8 million, totaled $360.0 million, or 1.71% of total assets at June 30, 2009, an increase of $23.4 million from the previous quarter, net of $46.1 million of non-performing loans either sold or classified as held-for-sale.  At June 30, 2009, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $287.9 million and multi-family/CRE non-performing loans totaled $68.2 million compared to $245.5 million and $88.7 million, respectively, at March 31, 2009.  Important to note, of the $360.0 million of non-performing loans, $166.5 million, or 46%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and adjusted, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.

The table below details, as of June 30, 2009, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states.  More comprehensive state details are included in the table at the end of this release.
(1)  Does not foot due to rounding.
(2)  Includes 29 states and Washington, DC
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 totaled $38.9 million (of which $20.6 million represented one-to-four family loans and $17.7 million represented multi-family/CRE loans) compared to $19.8 million (of which $11.2 million represented one-to-four family loans and $8.2 million represented multi-family/CRE loans) for the 2009 first quarter.  Included in the $20.6 million of one-to-four family loan charge-offs are $13.9 million of charge-offs on $67.4 million of non-performing loans which, at 180 days delinquent, were reviewed and adjusted to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs.  Included in the $17.7 million of multi-family/CRE loan charge-offs were $15.7 million on $46.1 million of non-performing loans that were either sold or classified as held-for-sale. Commenting on asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, The prolonged recession and high unemployment continues to strain the financial condition of prime residential borrowers and their ability to remain current on their mortgage loans and the ability of tenants in multi-family properties to pay rent on their apartments.  Important to note, although we experienced increased foreclosures, credit costs and non-performing loans, the pace of growth in non-performing loans slowed from the previous two quarters.  Additionally, loans delinquent 30-89 days decreased $1.4 million from March 31, 2009, considerably less than the $21.7 million and $74.2 million increases, respectively, in the previous two quarters.

Future Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2009, Mr. Engelke stated, The year continues to present us with both opportunities and challenges.  Although we are encouraged by the linked quarter decline in 30-89 day loan delinquencies and the reduced pace of growth in non-performing loans, we expect that job losses and economic weakness will continue to put pressure on borrowers.  This may result in somewhat higher delinquencies and non-performing loans; however, credit costs should continue to remain manageable.
With respect to our fundamental operating performance, we expect increases in net interest income and the net interest margin going forward as we begin to realize the benefit from the deployment of excess liquidity, coupled with significant CD maturities throughout the year at rates that are considerably above current market rates.  With respect to loan growth, although our mortgage loan pipeline has increased 65% this quarter, lower market rates for 30-year conforming mortgage loans coupled with the increased conforming loan limits in many of the markets we operate in, will accelerate loan prepayments in our one-to-four family loan portfolio and will temper loan growth in the near term.

(In Thousands, Except Per Share Data)
Income and expense and related financial ratios determined in accordance with GAAP (GAAP measures), excluding the charges and related tax effects detailed in the following table (non-GAAP measures) provide a meaningful comparison for effectively evaluating Astoria's operating results.  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2008, non-GAAP measures equaled GAAP measures.
Non-GAAP returns are calculated substituting non-GAAP net income for net income in the corresponding ratio calculation, while the non-GAAP general and administrative expense to average assets ratio substitutes non-GAAP general and administrative expense (non-GAAP non-interest expense) for general and administrative expense (non-interest expense) in the corresponding ratio calculation.  Similarly, the non-GAAP efficiency ratio substitutes non-GAAP non-interest income and non-GAAP general and administrative expense for non-interest income and general and administrative expense in the corresponding calculation.

Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, or the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), today reported net income of $8.0 million, or $0.09 diluted earnings per share (EPS), for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 compared to a net loss of $16.5 million, or $0.19 diluted loss per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, net income totaled $19.5 million, or $0.21 EPS, compared to $45.9 million, or $0.50 EPS, for the comparable 2008 period.
Lake Success, New York  October 21, 2009
 
Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2009 are pre-tax charges totaling $16.7 million ($10.9 million, after-tax, or $0.12 EPS) which are not routine to our core operations: an FDIC deposit insurance special assessment totaling $9.9 million, a $1.5 million lower of cost or market write-down on a former mortgage origination building, both recorded in the 2009 second quarter, and an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI), non-cash charge of $5.3 million recorded in the 2009 first quarter related to Freddie Mac preferred stock.  Included in last years third quarter and nine month net income and EPS is an OTTI non-cash pre-tax charge of $77.7 million ($57.9 million, after-tax, or $0.64 EPS) relating to Freddie Mac preferred stock.
Operating income and operating EPS, representing net income and EPS based upon generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) excluding the aforementioned items, are non-GAAP measures which provide a meaningful comparison for evaluating Astorias operating results.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2009, operating income of $8.0 million, or $0.09 operating EPS equaled net income and EPS compared to operating income of $41.4 million, or $0.45 operating EPS, for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 operating income totaled $30.4 million, or $0.33 operating EPS compared to $103.8 million, or $1.14 operating EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2008.  For a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, please refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Measures table included in this release.
Commenting on the 2009 third quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, Our results for the third quarter continue to reflect the impact of elevated credit costs associated with a weak national housing market and high unemployment.  In addition, loan growth was tempered as a result of the continued effects of the U.S. government subsidies to the residential mortgage market in the form of lower mortgage interest rates and higher conforming loan limits.  With respect to credit quality, although non-performing loans increased as anticipated, we are encouraged by the second consecutive quarterly decline in early stage (30-89 day) loan delinquencies, particularly the $46.7 million decline from the 2009 second quarter.

Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 21, 2009 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share.  The dividend is payable on December 1, 2009 to shareholders of record as of November 16, 2009.  This is the fifty-eighth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Third Quarter and Nine Month Earnings Summary
Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 totaled $103.1 million compared to $107.1 million for the 2008 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, net interest income increased to $323.8 million, or 15%, from $280.4 million for the comparable 2008 period.
The net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 was 2.07% compared to 2.06% for the 2008 third quarter and 2.16% for the 2009 second quarter.  On a linked quarter basis, the margin declined nine basis points due to several factors including lower loan rates on new and refinanced mortgage loans which are below current portfolio yields and an increased amount of hybrid ARMs repricing into one-year ARMs at lower rates.  Going forward, we expect margin growth to resume as we realize the benefit from higher yields on deployed excess liquidity coupled with a full quarter benefit from the lower certificate of deposit (CD) repricing during the third quarter and the partial effect from lower CD repricing expected in the fourth quarter, all of which should more than offset the effect of lower loan and asset yields.  Non-Liquid CDs totaling $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion are scheduled to mature in the 2009 fourth quarter and 2010 first quarter, respectively, with a weighted average rate of 3.31% and 3.00%, respectively.   Non-Liquid CDs were issued or repriced in September 2009 at a weighted average rate of 1.02%.  Further illustrating the pace of decline in deposit costs, the weighted average cost of deposits for the 2009 third quarter was 2.25%, while the weighted average cost of deposits at quarter-end was 2.16%.  On the asset side, during the 2009 fourth quarter and 2010 first quarter, a total of $1.2 billion of hybrid ARM loans, with a weighted average rate of 5.16%, are scheduled to reprice, Mr. Engelke noted.
 
For the quarter ended September 30, 2009, a $50.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded which was equal to the provision for the previous quarter and greater than the $13.0 million provision for the 2008 third quarter.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, provisions for loan losses totaled $150.0 million compared to $24.0 million for the comparable period in 2008.  Mr. Engelke noted, The 2009 provisions recognize the impact that the continued weakness in both the national housing market and the economy in general, particularly increasing unemployment, have had on the overall level of non-performing loans and loan charge-offs.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 totaled $20.1 million compared to $22.4 million for the 2008 third quarter, excluding the $77.7 million OTTI related to Freddie Mac preferred stock.  Included in 2009 third quarter non-interest income is a $3.8 million gain on sales of securities, a $2.8 million lower of cost or market write-down on loans held-for-sale and $1.1 million MSR valuation allowance.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, non-interest income totaled $63.3 million, excluding the OTTI charge and the mortgage building write-down and recorded in the 2009 first and second quarters, respectively, compared to $69.7 million for the comparable 2008 period, excluding the $77.7 million OTTI charge recorded in the 2008 third quarter.  The 2009 three and nine month decreases were primarily due to lower BOLI  income, customer service fees and other income, partially offset by gains on sales of securities and an increase in mortgage banking income, net.
 
2
 
General and administrative (G&A) expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 totaled $63.2 million compared to $58.8 million for the 2008 third quarter.  The increase was due primarily to increased FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by lower advertising expense.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, G&A expense totaled $193.4 million, excluding the FDIC special assessment recorded in the 2009 second quarter, compared to $177.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2008.  The increase was due primarily to increases in regular FDIC insurance premiums, separate from the FDIC special assessment, and compensation and benefits expense, primarily pension expense.
Balance Sheet Summary
Total assets declined $428.0 million and $1.3 billion for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, and totaled $20.7 billion at September 30, 2009.  The decrease for the 2009 third quarter was due to a reduction in cash due to the deployment of excess liquidity.  The decrease for the nine months was due to decreases in the loan and securities portfolios. As of September 30, 2009, the net loan portfolio, which totaled $16.0 billion, decreased $3.1 million from the previous quarter and $742.6 million from December 31, 2008.  The nine month decline included a decrease of $343.9 million in the one-to-four family loan portfolio and $357.1 million in the combined multi-family and commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio.  At September 30, 2009, the one-to-four family loan portfolio totaled $12.0 billion and the multi-family/CRE portfolio totaled $3.5 billion.  For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009, securities decreased $39.6 million and $565.0 million, respectively.
For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009, one-to-four family loan originations for portfolio totaled $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, compared to $1.1 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2008 periods.  One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2009 totaled $939.6 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, compared to $516.9 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2008 periods.  The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2009 third quarter and nine months averaged 58% and 57%, respectively, at origination and the individual loan amount averaged approximately $725,000 forboth periods.
 
Deposits for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 decreased $391.6 million from the previous quarter and $261.3 million from December 31, 2008, and totaled $13.2 billion at September 30, 2009.  The decreases were due primarily to decreases in CDs.  Commenting on deposit flows, Mr. Engelke noted, The deployment of excess liquidity during the 2009 third quarter coupled with a decrease in the loan portfolio, due to accelerated mortgage prepayment activity which outpaced our loan production, influenced our decision to reduce CDs in the third quarter.  Importantly, low-cost savings, money market and checking deposits increased $222.6 million, or 6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
Borrowings for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 decreased $49.9 million from the previous quarter and $1.1 billion from December 31, 2008 to $5.8 billion, at September 30, 2009.
Stockholders equity totaled $1.2 billion, or 5.83% of total assets at September 30, 2009.  Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with core, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 6.72%, 6.72%, 12.77% and 11.49%, respectively, at September 30, 2009.

Asset Quality
Non-performing loans (NPL), including troubled debt restructurings (TDR) of $55.4 million, totaled $408.5 million, or 1.98% of total assets at September 30, 2009, an increase of $48.5 million from the previous quarter.  During the 2009 third quarter, $23.4 million of non-performing loans were either sold or classified as held-for-sale.  At September 30, 2009, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $323.8 million and multi-family/CRE/construction non-performing loans totaled $80.8 million compared to $287.9 million and $68.2 million, respectively, at June 30, 2009.  Important to note, of the $408.5 million of non-performing loans, $195.6 million, or 48%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and adjusted, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
The comparative table below illustrates loan migration from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:
The table below details, as of September 30, 2009, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states.  More comprehensive state details are included in the One-to-Four Family Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis table included in this release.
(1)  Includes 29 states and Washington, D.C.

Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended September 30, 2009 totaled $33.6 million (of which $22.1 million represented one-to-four family loans and $11.1 million represented multi-family/CRE and construction loans) compared to $38.9 million (of which $20.6 million represented one-to-four family loans and $17.7 million represented multi-family/CRE and construction loans) for the 2009 second quarter. Included in the $22.1 million of one-to-four family loan net charge-offs are $14.8 million of charge-offs on $67.0 million of non-performing loans which, at 180 days delinquent, were reviewed and required an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs.  Commenting on asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, Although non-performing loans increased from the previous quarter, as we anticipated they would, we are encouraged by the decline in early stage delinquencies, which decreased $46.7 million, or 15%, from June 30, 2009, the second consecutive quarterly decline.
Selected Asset Quality Metrics
At or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009
(1)  Includes home equity loans of $304.1 million
(2)  Includes $109.5 million of net unamortized premiums and deferred loan costs
(3)  Does not cross foot due to rounding
(4)  Includes $195.6 million reviewed and adjusted, as needed, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter
Future Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for the remainder of 2009, Mr. Engelke stated, Although the economy is beginning to show signs of improvement, we continue to face challenges associated with high unemployment and depressed real estate values.  We expect that job losses and economic weakness will continue to strain the financial condition of prime residential borrowers and their ability to remain current on their mortgage loans and the ability of tenants to pay rent in multi-family properties.  This may result in somewhat higher non-performing loans, although total loan delinquencies appear to be stabilizing.  We are encouraged by the consecutive quarterly decline in early stage (30-89 day) loan delinquencies.  If this trend continues, it will have a positive impact on future credit costs.  In the near term, as a result of low interest rates for 30-year conforming mortgage loans coupled with elevated conforming loan limits in many of the markets we operate in, loan prepayments will remain high and temper loan growth.  With respect to the net interest margin, we expect modest increases going forward as we begin to realize the benefit from the reduction in excess liquidity and the significant CD repricing opportunities in the 2009 fourth quarter and 2010 first quarter.

Income and expense and related financial ratios determined in accordance with GAAP (GAAP measures), excluding the charges and related tax effects detailed in the following tables (non-GAAP measures) provide a meaningful comparison for effectively evaluating Astoria's operating results.
Non-GAAP returns are calculated substituting non-GAAP net income for net income (loss) in the corresponding ratio calculation, while the non-GAAP general and administrative expense to average assets ratio substitutes non-GAAP general and administrative expense (non-GAAP non-interest expense) for general and administrative expense (non-interest expense) in the corresponding ratio calculation.  Similarly, the non-GAAP efficiency ratio substitutes non-GAAP non-interest income and non-GAAP general and administrative expense for non-interest income (loss) and general and administrative expense in the corresponding calculation.

ASTORIA FINANCIAL CORPORATION ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER EPS OF $0.09
Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal, the Bank), today reported net income of $8.1 million, or $0.09 diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 compared to $29.4  million, or $0.32 EPS, (operating income of $22.1 million, or $0.24 operating EPS), for the 2008 fourth quarter.  Operating income equaled net income for the 2009 fourth quarter.
Lake Success, New York, January 27, 2010
 
(
a)
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, net income totaled $27.7 million, or $0.30 EPS, (operating income of $38.6 million, or $0.42 operating EPS) compared to $75.3 million, or $0.82 EPS, (operating income of $125.8 million, or $1.38 operating EPS) for the year ended December 31, 200
8.
(
b)
 
Operating income and operating EPS, representing net income and EPS determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) excluding the effects of certain items that are not routine to our core operations, provide a meaningful comparison for evaluating Astorias operating results and are detailed in the footnotes below.   For a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, please refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Measures table included in this release.
 
Commenting on the quarter and full year results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, noted While the decreases in the year-over-year fourth quarter and full year results reflect the effect of a prolonged and severe job loss recession that has resulted in increased loan delinquencies, higher credit costs and non-performing loans as compared to a year ago, the fundamental operating performance of the Company on a linked quarter basis is encouraging.  Specifically, the improvement in net interest income and the net interest margin coupled with the stabilizing trend in non-performing loans, will have a positive impact on earnings in future quarters.
 
(a)   Included in the 2008 fourth quarter is a tax benefit of $7.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, due to a tax adjustment related to the recognition of the 2008 third quarter other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charge relating to Freddie Mac preferred stock.
(b)  Included in the year ended December 31, 2009 are pre-tax charges totaling $16.7 million ($10.9 million, after-tax, or $0.12 per diluted share).  These included an FDIC deposit insurance special assessment totaling $9.9 million, a $1.6 million lower of cost or market write-down on a former mortgage origination building, both recorded in the 2009 second quarter, and an OTTI, non-cash charge of $5.3 million recorded in the 2009 first quarter related to Freddie Mac preferred stock.  Included in the year ended December 31, 2008, is an OTTI non-cash, pre-tax charge totaling $77.7 million ($50.5 million, after-tax, or $0.56 per diluted share) relating to Freddie Mac preferred stock.

Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
 
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their January 27, 2010 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share.  The dividend is payable on March 1, 2010 to shareholders of record as of February 16, 2010.  This is the fifty-ninth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
 
Board Sets Annual Shareholders Meeting Date
 
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their January 27, 2010 meeting, established May 19, 2010 as the date for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a voting record date of March 24, 2010.
 
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary
 
Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 totaled $105.0 million compared to $103.1 million for the 2009 third quarter and $114.9 million for the 2008 fourth quarter.   For the year ended December 31, 2009, net interest income increased $33.4 million, or 8.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2008, to $428.8 million.
 
Astorias net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 increased to 2.15%, 8 basis points above the 2009 third quarter and was just 3 basis points lower than the 2008 fourth quarter.  The linked quarter increase was due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declining more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.  During the 2009 fourth quarter, $2.2 billion of CDs matured (excluding Liquid CDs), with a weighted average rate of 3.28% and an original weighted average maturity of 12 months, and $1.6 billion of CDs were issued or repriced, with a weighted average rate of 1.59% and a weighted average maturity of 18 months.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, the margin was 2.13%, 22 basis points higher than the margin for the year ended December 31, 2008.   The increase, like that of the linked quarter increase, was primarily due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declining more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.  For the year ended December 31, 2009, $7.6 billion of CDs matured (excluding Liquid CDs), with a weighted average rate of 3.31% and an original weighted average maturity of 12 months, and $6.5 billion of CDs were issued or repriced, with a weighted average rate of 1.94% and a weighted average maturity of 14 months.  We have been successful in reducing the cost of CDs while extending the maturity terms in an effort to improve interest rate risk sensitivity, Mr. Engelke noted.    During 2009, the one-year cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap was reduced to negative 6.77% at December 31, 2009 compared to negative 19.06% at December 31, 2008, primarily due to increased mortgage cash flow, as well as a significant increase in mortgage loans repricing into one-year ARMs, coupled with the aforementioned extension of CD maturities.  For additional detail regarding the yields on interest-earning assets and costs on interest-bearing liabilities please refer to the Average Balance Sheets tables included in this release.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2009, a $50.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded which was equal to the provision for the previous quarter and $5.0 million greater than the $45.0 million provision for the 2008 fourth quarter.  For the year ended December 31, 2009, provisions for loan losses totaled $200.0 million compared to $69.0 million for 2008.  Mr. Engelke noted, The significant increase in the 2009 provisions recognizes the deterioration in the financial condition of many prime residential borrowers during the year, due to the severity of a prolonged job loss recession, weakness in the national housing market and a decline in real estate values, which resulted in higher loan delinquencies, credit costs and non-performing loans.
 
Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 totaled $23.3 million compared to $19.2 million for the comparable 2008 quarter.  The $4.1 million increase is primarily due to security gains of $1.5 million and net mortgage banking income of $805,000 compared to a $2.2 million net mortgage banking loss in the 2008 fourth quarter.   For the year ended December 31, 2009, non-interest income (excluding a $5.3 OTTI charge and a $1.6 million building write-down) totaled $86.7 million compared to $88.9 million (excluding a $77.7 million OTTI charge) for the comparable 2008 period.  The $2.2 million decrease is primarily due to a $7.8 million decrease in bank owned life insurance income, a $4.6 million decrease in customer service fees and $2.3 million, net, in lower of cost or market write-downs on non-performing loans held-for-sale during 2009, partially offset by $7.4 million in securities gains and a $6.0 million increase in mortgage banking income, net.
 
General and administrative expense (G&A) for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 totaled $66.8 million compared to $63.2 million for the 2009 third quarter and $56.2 million for the 2008 fourth quarter.  The linked quarter increase was primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in ESOP expense, a $1.0 million increase in real estate owned related expense and a $702,000 increase in advertising expense.  The fourth quarter year over year increase was due primarily to a $6.0 million increase in FDIC deposit insurance premiums and a $5.2 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, primarily due to increased pension expense.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2009, G&A totaled $270.1 million compared to $233.3 million.  The $36.8 million increase was primarily due to an $8.5 million increase in compensation and benefits expense primarily due to increased pension expense partially offset by lower ESOP expense, a $22.1 million increase in regular FDIC deposit insurance premiums and a $9.9 million FDIC deposit insurance special assessment in the 2009 second quarter, partially offset by lower occupancy, equipment and systems expense and lower advertising expense.
 
Balance Sheet Summary
 
Total assets decreased $421.1 million and $1.7 billion for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2009, respectively, and totaled $20.3 billion.  The decrease for the fourth quarter was due to a $189.1 million decrease in the loan portfolio and $293.7 million decrease in the securities portfolio.  The full year decrease was due to decreases of $454.3 million in the one-to-four family loan portfolio, $426.9 million in the multi-family/commercial real estate (CRE) mortgage loan portfolios and $858.7 million in the securities portfolio.  At December 31, 2009, the one-to-four family loan portfolio totaled $11.9 billion, the multi-family/CRE portfolio totaled $3.4 billion and the securities portfolio totaled $3.2 billion.

For the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2009, one-to-four family loan originations for portfolio totaled $916.4 million and $3.1 billion, respectively, compared to $422.7 million and $3.7 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2008 periods.  One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2009 totaled $891.3 million and $3.1 billion, respectively, compared to $330.3 million and $2.6 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2008 periods.  The loan-to-value ratio of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2009 fourth quarter and full year averaged 61% and 58%, respectively, at origination and the individual loan amount averaged $700,000 and $715,000, respectively.
 
Deposits for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 decreased $406.4 million from the previous quarter and $667.7 million from December 31, 2008, and totaled $12.8 billion at December 31, 2009.  The decreases were due primarily to decreases in CDs.   Commenting on deposit flows, Mr. Engelke noted, During the fourth quarter and throughout the year, accelerated mortgage prepayment activity, which outpaced our loan production, influenced our decision to reduce higher cost CDs.   Important to note, low-cost savings, money market and checking deposits increased $426.3 million, or 11.9%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009.  Also important to note, total deposits are comprised of retail deposits and do not include any broker or municipal deposits.
 
Borrowings for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 increased $40.1 million from the previous quarter and decreased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2008 to $5.9 billion.
 
Stockholders equity totaled $1.2 billion, or 5.97% of total assets at December 31, 2009.  Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with core, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 6.89%, 6.89%, 12.99% and 11.72%, respectively, at December 31, 2009.
 
Asset Quality
 
           Non-performing loans (NPL), including troubled debt restructurings (TDR) of $57.2 million, totaled $408.6 million, or 2.02% of total assets, at December 31, 2009, essentially flat from the previous quarter.  During the 2009 fourth quarter, $13.1 million of non-performing loans were either sold or classified as held-for-sale.  At December 31, 2009, one-to-four family non-performing loans totaled $330.1 million and multi-family/CRE/construction non-performing loans totaled $73.7 million compared to $323.8 million and $80.8 million, respectively, at September 30, 2009.  Important to note, of the $330.1 million of non-performing one-to-four family loans, $228.5 million, or 69%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and adjusted, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.  Commenting on asset quality, Mr. Engelke noted, Although non-performing loans have increased from a year ago, they have stabilized on a linked quarter basis.  In addition, although early stage loan delinquencies have increased slightly from the previous quarter, they are down from a year ago.
 
The comparative table below illustrates loan migration from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:

Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 totaled $32.6 million (of which $22.8 million represented one-to-four family loans and $9.2 million represented multi-family/CRE loans) compared to $33.6 million (of which $22.1 million represented one-to-four family loans and $11.1 million represented multi-family/CRE and construction loans) for the 2009 third quarter.  Included in the $22.8 million of one-to-four family loan net charge-offs are $17.3 million of charge-offs on $68.5 million of non-performing loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and required an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs.

(1)  Includes home equity loans of $302.4 million
(2)  Includes $105.9 million of net unamortized premiums and deferred loan costs
(3)  Includes $228.5 million reviewed and adjusted, as needed, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter
Future Outlook
 
Commenting on the outlook for 2010, Mr. Engelke stated, Despite high unemployment and a weak housing market, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic as the economy begins to show signs of improvement.  We are encouraged by the stabilizing trends we are seeing in non-performing loans, which if sustained, will have a positive impact on future credit costs and earnings.   In the near term, as a result of the U.S. governments efforts to keep residential mortgage rates artificially low coupled with elevated conforming loan limits in many of the markets we operate in, loan prepayments will remain high and restrain loan and balance sheet growth.  If and when these government programs subside, mortgage rates should return to normal market levels and we should resume loan and balance sheet growth at reasonable spreads.  With respect to the net interest margin, we expect modest increases in the first half of 2010 as we continue to realize the benefit from significant CD repricing opportunities.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES
(In Thousands, Except Per Share Data)
Income and expense and related financial ratios determined in accordance with GAAP (GAAP measures), excluding the charges and related tax effects detailed in the following tables (non-GAAP measures) provide a meaningful comparison for effectively evaluating Astoria's operating results.
 
Non-GAAP returns are calculated substituting non-GAAP net income for net income in the corresponding ratio calculation, while the non-GAAP general and administrative expense to average assets ratio substitutes non-GAAP general and administrative expense (non-GAAP non-interest expense) for general and administrative expense (non-interest expense) in the corresponding ratio calculation.  Similarly, the non-GAAP efficiency ratio substitutes non-GAAP non-interest income and non-GAAP general and administrative expense for non-interest income and general and administrative expense in the corresponding ratio calculation.

Exhibit 10.1
 
This AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the Amendment) is made and entered into as of April 21, 2010 by and between , a business corporation organized and operating under the laws of the State of Delaware and having an office at One Astoria Federal Plaza, Lake Success, New York 11042-1085 (the Company), and George L. Engelke, Jr., an individual residing at 83 Chelsea Road, Garden City, New York 11530 (the Executive).
Astoria Financial Corporation
 
 
, the Executive and the Company are parties to an Employment Agreement entered into on January 1, 1996 (the Initial Effective Date), amended and restated on January 1, 2000, further amended as of August 15, 2007 and amended and restated again as of January 1, 2009 (such agreement, as amended and restated through January 1, 2009, the Prior Agreement); and
Whereas
 
, the Executive and the Company wish to further amend and modify the Prior Agreement pursuant to Section 25 thereof;
Whereas
 
, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Company and the Executive hereby agree as follows:
Now, Therefore
 
 
(b)           Beginning on the Initial Effective Date, the Employment Period shall automatically be extended for one (1) additional day each day until the Executive attains the age of seventy-two (72), unless either the Company or the Executive elects not to extend the Agreement further by giving written notice to the other party, in which case the Employment Period shall end on the day before the third anniversary of the date on which such written notice is given.  When the Executive attains the age of seventy-two (72), the daily extensions will cease automatically without notice or other action, the Employment Period shall be for a fixed term of three years, thereafter, and this Agreement will expire when the Executive attains the age of seventy-five (75).  For all purposes of this Agreement, the term Remaining Unexpired Employment Period as of any date shall mean the period beginning on such date and ending on:
 
 (i)           if extensions have ceased in accordance with this Section 2(b), the day before the third anniversary of the date on which extensions were discontinued; and
 
 
 
 
 (ii)           in all other cases, the day before the third anniversary of the date as of which the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period is being determined.
 
Upon termination of the Executive's employment with the Company for any reason whatsoever, any daily extensions provided pursuant to this Section 2(b), if not previously discontinued, shall automatically cease.
 
 
The Executive shall serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, having such power, authority and responsibility and performing such duties as are prescribed by or pursuant to the By-Laws of the Company and as are customarily associated with such position. The Executive shall devote his or her full business time and attention (other than during weekends, holidays, approved vacation periods, and periods of illness or approved leaves of absence) to the business and affairs of the Company, its affiliates and subsidiaries and shall use his or her best efforts to advance the interests of the Company.  The Company reserves the right, from time to time, to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to transfer either, but not both, to an individual other than the Executive; in such event the effective date of such separation shall be referred to in this Agreement as the Transition Date.  Following the Transition Date, the Executive shall continue to be an employee of the Company..
 
 
In consideration for the services to be rendered by the Executive as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer hereunder, the Company shall pay to him or her a salary at an initial annual rate of ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,142,000), payable in approximately equal installments in accordance with the Company's customary payroll practices for senior officers. At least annually during the Employment Period, the Board shall review the Executive's annual rate of salary and may, in its discretion, approve an increase therein. In no event shall the Executive's annual rate of salary under this Agreement in effect at a particular time be reduced without his or her prior written consent and any such reduction in the absence of such consent shall be a material breach of this Agreement. In addition to salary, the Executive may receive other cash compensation from the Company for services hereunder at such times, in such amounts and on such terms and conditions as the Board may determine from time to time.  If the Company determines to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Executives compensation shall be adjusted in such manner as the Company may determine, subject to the following:
 
(a)           The Executives annual rate of base salary shall not be reduced below SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($750,000).
 
 
Page 2 of 7
 
 
(b)           Following the Transition Date, the Executives base salary for purposes of calculating his ..benefits under the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association Group Life Insurance Plan, Excess Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan shall be deemed to continue at the annual rate in effect immediately prior to the Transition Date.
 
(c)           Following the Transition Date, the base salary used for purposes of computing the termination benefit (if any) payable under sections 9(b)(iv), (v) and (vii) of this Agreement shall in no event be less than the annual rate of base salary in effect for the Executive immediately prior to the Transition Date.
 
(d)           Following the Transition Date, the target incentive opportunity used for purposes of computing the termination benefit (if any) payable under section 9(b)(vii) of this Agreement shall be the target incentive opportunity (expressed as a percentage of base salary) in effect immediately prior to the Transition Date.
 
It is the intent of the parties that adjustments to the Executives rate of base salary or participation in incentive plans that may occur on or after the Transition Date not diminish the benefits for which the Executive may be eligible under the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association Group Life Insurance Plan, Excess Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan or the termination benefits which may become payable to him under section 9(b)(iv), (v) or (vii) of this Agreement.  The foregoing provisions shall be construed to give effect to such intent.
 
 
(b)           To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, during the Employment Period and for the maximum period allowed under applicable law thereafter, the Company shall indemnify the Executive against, and hold him or her harmless from, any costs, liabilities, losses and exposures for acts or omissions in connection with service as an officer or director of the Company or service in other capacities at the request of the Company, to the fullest extent and on the most favorable terms and conditions that similar indemnification is offered to any director or officer of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.

, the Executive and the Association are parties to an Employment Agreement entered into on January 1, 1996 (the Initial Effective Date), amended and restated on January 1, 2000, further amended as of August 15, 2007 and amended and restated again as of January 1, 2009 (such agreement, as amended and restated through January 1, 2009, the Prior Agreement); and
Whereas
 
, the Executive and the Association wish to further amend and modify the Prior Agreement pursuant to Section 25 thereof;
Whereas
 
, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and conditions hereinafter set forth, the Association and the Executive hereby agree as follows:
Now, Therefore
 
 
(a)           The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be and remain in effect during the period of employment established under this Section 2 (the Employment Period). The Employment Period shall be for an initial term of three years beginning on the Initial Effective Date and ending on the third anniversary date of the Effective Date, plus such extensions, if any, as are provided by the Board of Directors of the Association (the Board) as provided below. Prior to the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement and on each anniversary date thereafter (each an Anniversary Date), the Board shall review the terms of this Agreement and the Executives performance of services hereunder and may, in the absence of objection from the Executive, approve an extension of the Employment Period. In such event, the Employment Period shall be extended to the third anniversary of the relevant Anniversary Date (or, if earlier the Executives seventy-fifth (75) birthday. In no event shall any extension cause the Employment Period to end later than the Executives seventy-fifth (75) birthday.  Unless sooner terminated by non-extension, the Employment Period will end automatically, without the requirement of any notice or other action, on the Executives seventy-fifth (75) birthday.
th
th
th
 
 
 
(b)           For all purposes of this Agreement, the term Remaining Unexpired Employment Period as of any date shall mean the period beginning on such date and ending on the earlier of (i) the Anniversary Date on which the Employment Period (as extended pursuant to Section 2(a) of this Agreement) is then scheduled to expire and (ii) the Executives seventy-fifth (75) birthday.
th
 
 
The Executive shall serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Association, having such power, authority and responsibility and performing such duties as are prescribed by or pursuant to the By-Laws of the Association and as are customarily associated with such position. The Executive shall devote his full business time and attention (other than during weekends, holidays, approved vacation periods, and periods of illness or approved leaves of absence) to the business and affairs of the Association and shall use his best efforts to advance the interests of the Association.  The Association reserves the right, from time to time, to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to transfer either, but not both, to an individual other than the Executive; in such event the effective date of such separation shall be referred to in this Agreement as the Transition Date.  Following the Transition Date, the Executive shall continue to be an employee of the Association.
 
 
In consideration for the services to be rendered by the Executive as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer hereunder, the Association shall pay to him a salary at an initial annual rate of ONE MILLION ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,142,000), payable in approximately equal installments in accordance with the Associations customary payroll practices for senior officers. At least annually during the Employment Period, the Board shall review the Executives annual rate of salary and may, in its discretion, approve an increase therein. In no event shall the Executive's annual rate of salary under this Agreement in effect at a particular time be reduced without his or her prior written consent and any such reduction in the absence of such consent shall be a material breach of this Agreement. In addition to salary, the Executive may receive other cash compensation from the Association for services hereunder at such times, in such amounts and on such terms and conditions as the Board may determine from time to time. If the Association determines to separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Executives compensation shall be adjusted in such manner as the Association may determine, subject to the following:
 
(a)           The Executives annual rate of base salary shall not be reduced below Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($750,000).
 
(b)           Following the Transition Date, the Executives base salary for purposes of calculating his ..benefits under the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association Group Life Insurance Plan, Excess Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan shall be deemed to continue at the annual rate in effect immediately prior to the Transition Date.
 
Page 2 of 7
 
 
(c)           Following the Transition Date, the base salary used for purposes of computing the termination benefit (if any) payable under sections 9(b)(iv), (v) and (vii) of this Agreement shall in no event be less than the annual rate of base salary in effect for the Executive immediately prior to the Transition Date.
 
(d)           Following the Transition Date, the target incentive opportunity used for purposes of computing the termination benefit (if any) payable under section 9(b)(vii) of this Agreement shall be the target incentive opportunity (expressed as a percentage of base salary) in effect immediately prior to the Transition Date.
 
It is the intent of the parties that adjustments to the Executives rate of base salary or participation in incentive plans that may occur on or after the Transition Date not diminish the benefits for which the Executive may be eligible under the Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association Group Life Insurance Plan, Excess Pension Plan and Supplemental Pension Plan or the termination benefits which may become payable to him under section 9(b)(iv), (v) or (vii) of this Agreement.  The foregoing provisions shall be construed to give effect to such intent.
 
 
(b)           To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, during the Employment Period and for the maximum period allowed under applicable law thereafter, the Association shall indemnify the Executive against, and hold him harmless from any costs, liabilities, losses and exposures for acts or omissions in connection with service as an officer or director of the Association or service in other capacities at the request of the Association, to the fullest extent and on the most favorable terms and conditions that similar indemnification is offered to any director or officer of the Association or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.  No provision in this Agreement nor any termination or expiration of this Agreement is intended to authorize the elimination or impairment of any right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the charter or a bylaw of the Association by amendment to such a provision after the occurrence of an act or omission that is the subject of an action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is sought.
 
 
(C)           the expiration of a thirty (30) day period following the date on which the Executive gives written notice to the Association of its material failure that is not directly related to the separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer under Section 3 of the Agreement, whether by amendment of the Associations Charter or By-laws, action of the Board or the Associations stockholders or otherwise, to vest in the Executive the functions, duties, or responsibilities prescribed in Section 3 of this Agreement as of the date hereof, unless, during such thirty (30) day period, the Association cures such failure in a manner determined by the Executive, in his or her discretion, to be satisfactory; or

(i)           the Association shall provide for a period of two years following the date of the Officer's discharge or, if less, the period from date of the Officer's discharge to the Initial Expiration Date , that the Association has previously notified the Officer pursuant to Section 1(a)(ii)(A) (the "Assurance Period") for the benefit of the Officer and the Officer's spouse and dependents continued group life, health (including hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental, accident and long-term disability insurance benefits on substantially the same terms and conditions (including any co-payments and deductibles, but excluding any premium sharing arrangements, it being the intention of the parties to this Agreement that the premiums for such insurance benefits shall be the sole cost and expense of the Association) in effect for them immediately prior to the Officer's discharge. The coverage provided under this section 6(b)(i) may, at the election of the Association, be secondary to the coverage provided as part of the Standard Termination Entitlements and to any employer-paid coverage provided by a subsequent employer or through Medicare, with the result that benefits under the other coverages will offset the coverage required by this section 6(b)(i), provided, however, that for purposes of this section 6(b)(i) benefits provided at the cost of the Officer or the Officer's spouse or dependants pursuant to the Comprehensive Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, as amended, shall not be considered Standard Termination Entitlements.

(a)           To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, from and after the effective date of a Change of Control, the Association and the Company agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Officer, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (collectively, "Costs") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, for acts or omissions in connection with service as an officer of the Association or service in other capacities at the request of the Association or the Company at or prior to the time the Change of Control became effective, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the effective date of the Change of Control, and to advance any such Costs to the Officer as they are from time to time incurred, in each case to the fullest extent the Officer would have been indemnified as a director or officer of the Association or the Company, as applicable, and as then permitted under applicable law. No provision in this Agreement nor any termination or expiration of this Agreement is intended to authorize the elimination or impairment of any right to indemnification or to advancement of expenses arising under a provision of the certificate of incorporation or a bylaw of the Company or the Charter and or a bylaw of the Association by amendment to such a provision after the occurrence of an act or omission that is the subject of an action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is sought.

Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) (Astoria, the Company), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association (Astoria Federal), today reported net income of $15.5 million, or $0.17 EPS, for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, compared to $2.7 million, or $0.03 EPS, for the comparable 2009 period.  For the six months ended June 30, 2010, net income totaled $28.5 million, or $0.30 EPS, compared to $11.5 million, or $0.12 EPS, for the comparable 2009 period.  Included in the 2010 second quarter and six month results are net charges totaling $3.2 million (or $2.1 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), which are not routine to our core operations and are excluded from operating income and operating EPS. For further details and a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, please refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to non-GAAP Measures tables included in this release.
Lake Success, New York  July 21, 2010
 
 
Operating income and operating EPS for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010 totaled $17.6 million, or $0.19, and $30.6 million, or $0.33, respectively, compared to $10.1 million, or $0.11, and $22.4 million, or $0.24, respectively, for the comparable 2009 periods.
 
Commenting on the second quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, I am pleased to report continued earnings improvement in the 2010 second quarter, a significant achievement considering our balance sheet contracted during the quarter.  The improvement is due, primarily, to lower credit costs. 
 
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
 
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 21, 2010 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share.  The dividend is payable on September 1, 2010 to shareholders of record as of August 16, 2010.  This is the sixty-first consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
 
Second Quarter and Six Month Earnings Summary
 
Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 increased to $111.9 million from $109.1 million for the 2009 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, net interest income increased to $226.3 million from $220.7 million for the comparable 2009 period.
 
1
 
The net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 was 2.37%, two basis points lower than the previous quarter and 21 basis points higher than 2.16% for the 2009 second quarter.  The linked quarter decrease was due to the effect of one extra day of interest expense and the extension of borrowings in the 2010 second quarter.  During the 2010 second quarter $325 million of borrowings were extended with an average maturity of 3.3 years and a weighted average rate of 1.93% which resulted in excess liquidity at quarter-end pending the deployment of the proceeds.  The year-over-year increase in the margin was due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declining more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2010, the net interest margin increased 22 basis points to 2.38% from 2.16% for the comparable 2009 period.
 
For the quarter ended June 30, 2010, a $35.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded, $10.0 million lower than the $45.0 million provision for the previous quarter and $15.0 million lower than the provision for the 2009 second quarter.  For the six months ended June 30, 2010, the provision for loan losses totaled $80.0 million, $20.0 million lower than the provision for the comparable 2009 period.  Mr. Engelke noted, The lower provision for loan losses recognizes the stabilization in our asset quality and the improvement in the economy in general.  We remain cautiously optimistic that these trends will continue.
 
Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 totaled $23.2 million compared to $20.4 million for the 2009 second quarter.  Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, excluding the previously announced goodwill litigation settlement, partially offset by a write-down of premises and equipment, totaled $18.5 million compared to $22.0 million for the 2009 second quarter, excluding a write-down of premises and equipment.  This decrease is due to lower mortgage banking fee income, net, and lower customer service fees.
 
 
Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 totaled $41.9 million compared to $36.4 million for the comparable 2009 period.  For the six months ended June 30, 2010, non-interest income, excluding the aforementioned items, totaled $37.2 million compared to $43.3 million for the comparable 2009 period, excluding a write-down of premises and equipment and an other-than-temporary impairment write-down of Freddie Mac securities.  This decrease is due primarily to lower customer service fees, the absence of security gains in the 2010 six month period and lower mortgage banking fee income, net.
 
General and administrative (G&A) expense for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010 totaled $75.8 million and $144.1 million, respectively, compared to $76.0 million and $140.0 million, respectively, for the comparable 2009 periods.  Excluding the recently announced McAnaney litigation settlement, G&A expense for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010 totaled $68.0 million and $136.2 million, respectively, compared to $66.2 million and $130.1 million, respectively, for the 2009 second quarter and six months, excluding the FDIC special assessment.  The six month increase is primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expense and higher FDIC insurance premiums.
 
For further details and a reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures, please refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to non-GAAP Measures tables included in this release.
 
Balance Sheet Summary
 
Total assets decreased $391.0 million from the previous quarter and $582.2 million from December 31, 2009 and totaled $19.7 billion at June 30, 2010.  The loan portfolio declined $271.5 million from the previous quarter and $414.4 million from December 31, 2009 and totaled $15.4 billion at June 30, 2010.  The one-to-four family portfolio totaled $11.7 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to $11.8 billion at March 31, 2010 and $11.9 billion at December 31, 2009.  The combined multifamily/commercial real estate portfolio totaled $3.2 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to $3.3 billion at March 31, 2010 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009.

For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010, one-to-four family loan originations for portfolio totaled $758.5 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, compared to $668.5 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2009 periods.  This was achieved while maintaining our strict underwriting standards.  The loan-to-value ratio of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2010 second quarter and six months each averaged approximately 61% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $755,000 and $737,000, respectively.  One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010 totaled $748.4 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, compared to $810.1 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2009 periods.
 
Deposits decreased $436.4 million from the previous quarter and $563.8 million from December 31, 2009 to $12.2 billion at June 30, 2010.  Importantly, low-cost savings, money market and checking account deposits increased $112.2 million, or 11% annualized, from March 31, 2010 and $192.8 million, or 10% annualized, from December 31, 2009.  The Company continues to focus on lengthening liabilities, both CDs and borrowings, in an effort to reduce future interest rate risk.  During the first half of 2010 approximately $1 billion of CDs were extended for terms of at least 2 years with a weighted average rate of 2.58% and $525 million of borrowings were extended for an average term of 3.3 years with a weighted average rate of 2.05%.  
 
Stockholders equity was $1.2 billion, or 6.24% of total assets at June 30, 2010.  Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with core, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 7.15%, 7.15%, 13.47% and 12.21%, respectively, at June 30, 2010.
 
Asset Quality
 
Non-performing loans (NPL), including troubled debt restructurings (TDR) of $51.8 million, totaled $415.1 million, or 2.11% of total assets at June 30, 2010, a decrease of $4.0 million from the previous quarter.  During the 2010 second quarter, $31.6 million of NPLs were either sold or classified as held-for-sale.  At June 30, 2010, one-to-four family NPLs totaled $350.6 million, multi-family/CRE/construction NPLs totaled $59.2 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $5.3 million compared to $349.5 million, $64.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively, at March 31, 2010.  Important to note, of the $350.6 million of non-performing one-to-four family loans, $245.4 million, or 70%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
 
The comparative table below illustrates loan migration from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:
 
 
The following table details, as of June 30, 2010, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states.  More comprehensive state details
are included in the One-to-Four Family Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis table included in this release.
 
3
 
(1)  Includes 28 states and Washington, D.C.
 
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 totaled $34.7 million (including $20.1 million of one-to-four family loans and $12.6 million of multi-family/CRE loans) compared to $28.3 million (including $17.4 million of one-to-four family loans and $10.6 million of multi-family/CRE loans) for the 2010 first quarter.  Included in the $20.1 million of one-to-four family loan charge-offs are $14.7 million of charge-offs on $73.2 million of non-performing loans which, at 180 days delinquent or annually thereafter, were reviewed and adjusted, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs.  
 
 While we expect non-performing loan levels may remain elevated for some time as we work through the foreclosure process, it is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 70% of the residential non-performing loans to their adjusted fair value less selling costs, Mr. Engelke noted.
 
Selected Asset Quality Metrics
at or for the three months ended June 30, 2010)
(
 
(1)  Includes home equity loans of $295.8 million
(2)  Includes $99.1 million of net unamortized premiums and deferred loan costs
(3)  Includes $245.4 million reviewed and adjusted, as needed, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter
(4)  Includes $18.6 million of TDRs performing in accordance with their modified terms

Future Outlook
 
Commenting on the outlook for 2010, Mr. Engelke stated, With the national economic recovery underway, and despite the fact that the pace appears to be moderating and the housing market remains soft, the long-term outlook for our credit quality is improving.  This should translate into lower credit costs and further improvement in our financial performance.  In terms of loan and balance sheet growth, as long as the U.S. government continues to subsidize the residential mortgage market with programs designed to keep 30-year fixed-rate conforming loans below normal market rate levels, coupled with expanded conforming loan limits in many of the markets we operate in, we do not anticipate our loan production increasing at this time which, more than likely, will result in a slightly smaller loan portfolio and balance sheet.

Astoria Financial Corporation Reports Third Quarter EPS of $0.23
Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share Declared
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria", the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $21.5 million, or $0.23 diluted earnings per share ("EPS"), for the quarter ended September 30, 2010, increases of 169% and 156%, respectively, over net income of $8.0 million, or $0.09 EPS, for the quarter ended September 30, 2009.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, net income totaled $49.9 million, or $0.53 EPS, compared to $19.5 million, or $0.21 EPS, for the comparable 2009 period.  
Included in the 2010 nine month period are net charges totaling $3.2 million ($2.1 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), which are not routine to our core operations.  Included in the 2009 nine month period are charges totaling $16.7 million ($10.9 million, or $0.12 per share, after-tax,) which are not routine to our core operations.  For further details of such items and a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP measures, please refer to the "Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures" table included in this release.
Commenting on the 2010 third quarter results, George L. Engelke, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, "I am pleased to report significantly improved earnings for the 2010 third quarter compared to both the prior quarter and last year's third quarter, despite considerable shrinkage of the balance sheet.  The improvement is due primarily to lower credit costs reflecting the overall improvement in asset quality, particularly lower loan delinquencies and non-performing loans."  
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 20, 2010 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share.  The dividend is payable on December 1, 2010 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2010.  This is the sixty-second consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Third Quarter and Nine Month Earnings Summary
Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 increased to $106.0 million from $103.1 million for the 2009 third quarter.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, net interest income increased to $332.3 million from $323.8 million for the comparable 2009 period.
The net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 was 2.32%, five basis points lower than the previous quarter and 25 basis points higher than the 2009 third quarter.  The linked quarter decrease was primarily due to the effect of one extra day of interest expense in the third quarter. The year-over-year increase in the margin was due to the cost of interest-bearing liabilities declining more rapidly than the yield on interest-earning assets.  "The continued decline in liability costs, due primarily to lower certificates of deposit ("CD") repricing, should help to offset the decline in asset yields.  Non-Liquid CDs totaling $2.0 billion are scheduled to mature in the 2010 fourth quarter and $1.8 billion are scheduled to mature in the first half of 2011, with a weighted average rate of 1.81% and 1.92%, respectively.  On the asset side, $894.1 million of hybrid ARM loans, with a weighted average rate of 4.66%, are scheduled to reprice downward during the 2010 four th quarter and $1.6 billion of hybrid ARM loans, with a weighted average rate of 4.46%, are scheduled to reprice downward during the first half of 2011,"  Mr. Engelke noted.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2010, a $20.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded which is $15.0 million lower than the previous quarter and $30.0 million lower than the 2009 third quarter.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, the provision for loan losses totaled $100.0 million compared to $150.0 million for the comparable period in 2009.  Mr. Engelke noted, "The decrease in the provision this year recognizes the improving trends in overall loan delinquencies, particularly, in our multi-family and CRE portfolios."
Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 totaled $18.6 million compared to $20.1 million for the 2009 third quarter.  The decrease is primarily due to the absence of gain on sales of securities in 2010 and a decrease in customer service fees, partially offset by an increase in other non-interest income.        
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, non-interest income totaled $60.5 million compared to $56.5 million for the comparable 2009 period.  The increase is primarily due to an increase in other non-interest income, of which $6.2 million was from a goodwill litigation settlement in the 2010 second quarter, and an other-than-temporary impairment charge related to Freddie Mac securities recorded in the 2009 first quarter, partially offset by the absence of gain on sales of securities in 2010 and decreases in customer service fees and mortgage banking income, net.  
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 totaled $70.9 million compared to $63.2 million for the 2009 third quarter.  The increase is primarily due to a $4.1 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily increased ESOP expense and accruals for incentive compensation, and a $2.6 million increase in other expense, primarily real estate owned related expense.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, G&A expense totaled $215.0 million compared to $203.2 million for the comparable 2009 period.  The increase was due primarily to the following:  a $6.7 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily related to ESOP expense and accruals for incentive compensation, a $10.9 million increase in other expense, of which $7.9 million was related to the McAnaney litigation settlement, and a $2.0 million increase in regular FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by the $9.9 million FDIC special assessment recorded in 2009.
Balance Sheet Summary
Total assets decreased $733.1 million from the previous quarter and $1.3 billion from December 31, 2009 and totaled $18.9 billion at September 30, 2010.  The loan portfolio declined $467.1 million from the previous quarter and $881.5 million from December 31, 2009 and totaled $14.9 billion at September 30, 2010.  The one-to-four family portfolio totaled $11.4 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $11.7 billion at June 30, 2010 and $11.9 billion at December 31, 2009.  The combined multifamily/commercial real estate portfolio totaled $3.1 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $3.2 billion at June 30, 2010 and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009.  For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010, securities decreased $145.5 million and $587.4 million, respectively, to $2.6 billion.  Commenting on the decrease in the balance sheet, Mr. Engelke stated, "The combination of conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rates at historic lows and high conforming loan limi ts, resulting from the U.S. Government's efforts to stimulate housing loan demand, has had a negative impact on jumbo hybrid ARM portfolio lenders such as Astoria and has contributed to the decrease in our loan portfolio and balance sheet."
For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010, one-to-four family loan originations for portfolio totaled $646.7 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, compared to $1.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2009 periods.  This production was achieved while maintaining strict underwriting standards.  The loan-to-value ratio of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2010 third quarter and nine months averaged approximately 63% and 62%, respectively, at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $728,000 and $734,000, respectively.  One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2010 totaled $848.3 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, compared to $939.6 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2009 periods.  
Deposits for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 decreased $141.2 million from the previous quarter and $705.0 million from December 31, 2009, and totaled $12.1 billion at September 30, 2010.  The decreases were due primarily to decreases in CDs.  Importantly, low-cost savings, money market and checking account deposits increased $231.3 million from December 31, 2009, or 8% annualized.
Borrowings for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 decreased $599.9 million from the previous quarter and $664.7 million from December 31, 2009 to $5.2 billion.
Stockholders' equity totaled $1.2 billion, or 6.56% of total assets at September 30, 2010.  Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with core, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 7.59%, 7.59%, 14.13% and 12.87%, respectively, at September 30, 2010.
Asset Quality
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings ("TDR") of $53.5 million, totaled $399.6 million, or 2.11% of total assets at September 30, 2010, a decrease of $15.5 million from the previous quarter.  During the 2010 third quarter, $22.3 million of NPLs were either sold or classified as held-for-sale.  At September 30, 2010, one-to-four family NPLs declined to $345.7 million, multi-family/CRE/construction NPLs declined to $48.9 million and consumer and other NPLs declined to $5.0 million compared to $350.6 million, $59.2 million and $5.3 million at June 30, 2010.  Of the $345.7 million of non-performing one-to-four family loans, $247.8 million, or 72%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
The following table illustrates loan migration trends from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:
The table below details, as of September 30, 2010, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states.  More comprehensive state details are included in the "One-to-Four Family Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis" table included in this release.  
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 totaled $24.8 million (including $18.4 million of one-to-four family loans and $5.4 million of multi-family/CRE loans) compared to $34.7 million (including $20.1 million of one-to-four family loans and $12.6 million of multi-family/CRE loans) for the previous quarter.  Included in the $18.4 million of one-to-four family net loan charge-offs are $16.2 million of charge-offs on $71.7 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and adjusted, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs.  "While we expect NPL levels may remain elevated for some time, it is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 72% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less selling costs," Mr. Engelke noted.
Future Outlook  
Commenting on the near-term outlook, Mr. Engelke stated, "Although we remain cautiously optimistic with respect to the outlook for credit quality and we expect credit costs will continue to decline over the next several quarters resulting in improved financial performance, the operating environment for residential mortgage portfolio lenders, nonetheless, remains challenging. The U.S. government continues to subsidize the residential mortgage market with programs designed to keep 30-year fixed-rate conforming loans, which we originate but do not retain for our portfolio, below normal market rate levels.  In addition, the U.S. Congress recently extended the expanded conforming loan limits in many of the markets we operate in through September 2011, therefore, we anticipate that elevated levels of mortgage prepayment activity will continue to outpace our loan production.  This will, more than likely, result in the loan portfolio and balance sheet declining further in the near term.  We antici pate maintaining a relatively stable net interest margin which, when coupled with lower credit costs, should mitigate the earnings impact from a smaller balance sheet.  In the meantime, we will continue to strengthen the balance sheet by continuing to originate quality residential mortgage loans for portfolio.  We expect capital levels will continue to increase as earnings continue to improve which should position us to take advantage of future balance sheet growth opportunities that may arise."
Earnings Conference Call October 21, 2010 at 10:00 a.m. (ET)

Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 totaled $101.5 million compared to $101.2 million for the previous quarter and $114.4 million for the 2010 first quarter. The net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 was 2.40%, up eight basis points from the previous quarter and one basis point higher than the 2010 first quarter. Approximately four basis points of the linked quarter increase is due to two less days of interest expense in the 2011 first quarter.
For the quarter ended March 31, 2011, a $7.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded, $8.0 million lower than the previous quarter and $38.0 million lower than the 2010 first quarter. Mr. Engelke noted, "The lower provision primarily reflects improving trends in asset quality over the past twelve months, notably a 19% decrease in early stage delinquencies, an 11% decrease in non-performing loans and a 14% decrease in total loan delinquencies, coupled with the decline in the loan portfolio. Important to note, the allowance for loan losses to total loans, or the coverage ratio, remains strong at 1.37% at March 31, 2011."
Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 totaled $18.0 million compared to $20.7 million for the previous quarter and $18.7 million for the 2010 first quarter. The linked quarter decrease is primarily due to lower other non-interest income and lower mortgage banking income, net, primarily due to lower net gain on sales of loans.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 totaled $69.6 million, essentially unchanged from the previous quarter and up $1.4 million from the 2010 first quarter.
Balance Sheet Summary
Total assets decreased $382.1 million from December 31, 2010 and totaled $17.7 billion at March 31, 2011. The loan portfolio declined $438.1 million from December 31, 2010 and totaled $13.8 billion at March 31, 2011. The one-to-four family portfolio totaled $10.6 billion at March 31, 2011 compared to $10.9 billion at December 31, 2010. The combined multi-family/commercial real estate ("CRE") portfolio totaled $2.7 billion at March 31, 2011 compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2010.
Commenting on the decrease in the balance sheet, Mr. Engelke stated, "As anticipated, the pace of the decline in the loan portfolio and the balance sheet has slowed as the level of loan prepayment activity has fallen. We expect that this trend will continue which should mean less shrinkage in the second quarter and growth expected to resume in the second half of the year."
For the quarter ended March 31, 2011, one-to-four family loan originations for portfolio totaled $707.4 million compared to $643.6 million for the previous quarter and $838.9 million for the 2010 first quarter. The loan-to-value ratio of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2011 first quarter averaged approximately 60% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $727,000. One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 totaled $786.2 million compared to $1.0 billion for the previous quarter and $749.6 million for the 2010 first quarter. Multi-family/CRE loan prepayments totaled $193.1 million for the 2011 first quarter compared to $112.5 million for the previous quarter and $39.7 million for the 2010 first quarter.
Deposits at March 31, 2011 totaled $11.5 billion compared to $11.6 billion at December 31, 2010. During the 2011 first quarter, CD accounts (including Liquid CDs) decreased $244.8 million from December 31, 2010, while low cost savings, checking and money market accounts increased $121.1 million, or 10% annualized. Notwithstanding the decline in CDs, during the 2011 first quarter we extended $320.7 million of CDs for terms of two years or more in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates. At March 31, 2011, our one-year interest rate sensitivity gap was positive 4.92%.
Borrowings during the quarter ended March 31, 2011 decreased $291.9 million to $4.6 billion at March 31, 2011.
Stockholders' equity totaled $1.3 billion, or 7.14% of total assets at March 31, 2011. Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with leverage, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 8.17%, 8.17%, 15.18% and 13.89%, respectively, at March 31, 2011.
Asset Quality
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") of $35.3 million, totaled $373.8 million, or 2.11% of total assets at March 31, 2011, a decrease of $16.9 million from the previous quarter. During the 2011 first quarter, $9.0 million of NPLs were either sold or classified as held-for-sale. At March 31, 2011, one-to-four family NPLs declined to $333.0 million, multi-family/CRE/construction NPLs declined to $35.6 million and consumer and other NPLs declined to $5.1 million compared to $342.3 million, $42.8 million and $5.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Of the $333.0 million of one-to-four family NPLs, $257.1 million, or 77%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
The following table illustrates loan migration trends from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:
The table below details, as of March 31, 2011, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states. More comprehensive state details are included in the "One-to-Four Family Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis" table included in this release.
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2011 totaled $19.0 million (including $15.3 million of one-to-four family loans and $2.9 million of multi-family/CRE loans) compared to $19.7 million (including $15.6 million of one-to-four family loans and $2.6 million of multi-family/CRE loans) for the previous quarter. Included in the $15.3 million of one-to-four family net loan charge-offs are $12.2 million of charge-offs on $53.1 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2011 first quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs. "While we expect NPL levels will remain elevated for some time, it is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 77% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less selling costs," Mr. Engelke noted.
Future Outlook
Commenting on the near-term outlook, Mr. Engelke stated, "As the national economy continues to modestly recover and job growth continues, we expect further improvement in credit costs, even while non-performing loans remain elevated as we work through the extended foreclosure process. The operating environment for residential mortgage portfolio lenders remains challenging, although we are cautiously optimistic that the recent elevated interest rate level of 30 year fixed-rate conforming loans compared to the 2010 third and fourth quarter levels, together with the anticipated reduction in the expanded conforming loan limits in October 2011, will facilitate future residential loan growth. In addition, we expect to resume multi-family/commercial real estate lending in the second half of 2011 which will augment growth in the loan portfolio and balance sheet. For 2011, we anticipate maintaining a relatively stable net interest margin which, when coupled with lower credit costs, should mitigate the earnings impact from a smaller average balance sheet and the expected impact of significantly higher FDIC insurance premium expense. We expect capital levels to continue to increase which should support loan and balance sheet growth in the second half of 2011 and next year."

Astoria Financial Corporation Reports 6% and 53% Increase In Second Quarter and Six Months Earnings Per Share, Respectively, to $0.18 and $0.46, Respectively
Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share Declared
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 20, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria", the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $16.8 million, or $0.18 diluted earnings per share ("diluted EPS"), for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, increases of 8% and 6%, respectively, over net income of $15.5 million, or $0.17 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended June 30, 2010. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, net income totaled $44.2 million, or $0.46 diluted EPS, increases of 55% and 53%, respectively, over net income of $28.5 million, or $0.30 diluted EPS, for the comparable 2010 period. Included in the 2010 second quarter and six month results are net charges totaling $3.2 million (or $2.1 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), which are not routine to our core operations. For further detail, see the "Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures" table included in this release.
Commenting on the second quarter results, Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, "While disappointed with the second quarter results, which were negatively impacted by the continued decrease in interest-earning assets and the slightly higher provision for loan losses compared to the first quarter, I continue to remain optimistic that future credit costs will resume their downward trend and loan and balance sheet growth will resume in the second half of this year."
Second Quarter Financial Highlights
Low cost savings, money market and checking accounts increased $633.5 million, or 14%, from June 30, 2010 and increased $108.2 million, or 9% annualized, from March 31, 2011, to $5.0 billion
Early stage loan delinquencies (30-89 days past due) decreased to $207.2 million, a decline of $101.2 million, or 33%, from June 30, 2010 and $10.0 million, or 18% annualized, from March 31, 2011
Total past due loans decreased to $583.5 million, a decline of $140.0 million, or 19%, from June 30, 2010 and $7.5 million, or 5% annualized, from March 31, 2011
The Company's tangible common equity ratio increased to 6.46%, up 111 basis points from June 30, 2010 and 30 basis points from March 31, 2011
Astoria Federal's leverage and tangible capital ratios increased to 8.61%, up 146 basis points from June 30, 2010 and 44 basis points from March 31, 2011
Astoria Federal's tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased to 14.48%, up 227 basis points from June 30, 2010 and 59 basis points from March 31, 2011
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their July 20, 2011 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share. The dividend is payable on September 1, 2011 to shareholders of record as of August 15, 2011. This is the sixty-fifth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Second Quarter and Six Months Earnings Summary
Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 totaled $95.7 million compared to $101.5 million for the previous quarter and $111.9 million for the 2010 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, net interest income totaled $197.3 million compared to $226.3 million for the comparable 2010 period. The decreases in net interest income are due primarily to the significant decreases in average interest-earnings assets of $506.7 million and $2.4 billion on a linked quarter and year over year basis, respectively. The net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 was 2.34% compared to 2.40% for the previous quarter and 2.37% for the 2010 second quarter. Approximately 3 basis points of the linked quarter decrease are due to one extra day of interest expense in the 2011 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the net interest margin was 2.37% compared to 2.38% for the comparable 2010 six month period.
For the quarter ended June 30, 2011, a $10.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded compared to $7.0 million for the previous quarter and $35.0 million for the 2010 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the provision for loan losses totaled $17.0 million compared to $80.0 million for the comparable 2010 period. Mr. Redman noted, "With a somewhat weaker economy and slightly higher unemployment, along with the prolonged softness in housing values, we felt it prudent to maintain our strong coverage ratio. The allowance for loan losses to total loans, or the coverage ratio, remains over 1%, at 1.35% at June 30, 2011."
Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 totaled $17.0 million compared to $18.0 million for the previous quarter and $23.2 million for the 2010 second quarter. Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2011 totaled $35.1 million compared to $41.9 million for the comparable 2010 period. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010, non-interest income includes a $6.2 million gain relating to a litigation settlement, partially offset by a $1.5 million impairment write-down of premises and equipment. The linked quarter decrease is due to lower mortgage banking income, net, including lower net gain on sales of loans. The decrease for the six months ended June 30, 2011 is also due to customer service fees decreasing $2.8 million.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2011 totaled $76.0 million compared to $69.6 million for the previous quarter and $75.8 million for the 2010 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, G&A expense totaled $145.6 million compared to $144.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2010, G&A expense includes a $7.9 million litigation settlement. Commenting on the 2011 second quarter expenses, Mr. Redman stated, "The 2011 second quarter G&A expense was impacted by a $5.7 million, or 103%, increase in FDIC insurance premium expense from the previous quarter. We are anticipating the FDIC insurance premium expense to be lower starting in either the third or fourth quarter of this year."
Balance Sheet Summary
Total assets decreased $586.8 million from March 31, 2011 and $968.9 million from December 31, 2010 and totaled $17.1 billion at June 30, 2011. The decline is due to a decrease in loans and securities.
The one-to-four family portfolio totaled $10.6 billion at June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011 compared to $10.9 billion at December 31, 2010. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011, one-to-four family loan originations for portfolio totaled $636.2 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, compared to $758.5 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods. The loan-to-value ratio of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2011 second quarter and six months averaged approximately 62% and 61%, respectively, at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $785,000 and $754,000, respectively. One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011 totaled $610.5 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, compared to $748.4 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods.
The combined multi-family/commercial real estate ("CRE") portfolio totaled $2.6 billion at June 30, 2011 compared to $2.7 billion at March 31, 2011 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2010. Multi-family/CRE loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011 totaled $133.3 million and $326.4 million, respectively, compared to $76.7 million and $116.3 million for the comparable 2010 periods.
As previously anticipated, our expectation for loan and balance sheet growth starting in the second half of this year is predicated on several factors. The one-to-four family loan pipeline, excluding our own customer loan refinances, is 50%, or almost $300 million, higher than it was at March 31, 2011. In addition, we expect that residential conforming loan limits will be significantly reduced on October 1, 2011, and we have resumed accepting multi-family loan applications.
The securities portfolio declined $192.4 million from March 31, 2011 and totaled $2.4 billion at June 30, 2011, due to the absence of purchase activity in the second quarter. We expect to maintain our securities portfolio at June 30, 2011 levels, or slightly higher, throughout the remainder of 2011.
Deposits decreased $264.7 million from the previous quarter and $388.4 million from December 31, 2010 to $11.2 billion at June 30, 2011. Importantly, low-cost savings, money market and checking account deposits increased $108.2 million, or 9% annualized, from March 31, 2011 and $229.3 million, or 10% annualized, from December 31, 2010. CD accounts (including Liquid CDs) decreased $372.9 million from the previous quarter and $617.7 million from December 31, 2010. Notwithstanding the decline in CDs, during the first half of 2011, we extended $538.2 million of CDs for terms of two years or more in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates. At June 30, 2011, our one-year interest rate sensitivity gap was positive 1.38%.
Borrowings decreased $290.9 million from the previous quarter and $582.8 million from December 31, 2010 to $4.3 billion at June 30, 2011.
Stockholders' equity totaled $1.3 billion, or 7.47% of total assets at June 30, 2011. Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with leverage, tangible, total risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 8.61%, 8.61%, 15.78% and 14.48%, respectively, at June 30, 2011.
Asset Quality
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") of $45.6 million, totaled $376.3 million, or 2.20% of total assets at June 30, 2011, an increase of $2.5 million from the previous quarter. During the 2011 second quarter, $15.3 million of NPLs were either sold or classified as held-for-sale. One-to-four family NPLs totaled $329.6 million, multi-family/CRE/construction NPLs totaled $41.6 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $5.2 million compared to $333.0 million, $35.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively, at March 31, 2011. Of the $329.6 million of one-to-four family NPLs, $250.8 million, or 76%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
The following table illustrates loan migration trends from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:
The table below details, as of June 30, 2011, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states. More comprehensive state details are included in the "One-to-Four Family Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis" table included in this release.
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2011 totaled $16.8 million and $35.8 million, respectively, compared to $34.7 million and $63.1 million, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods. Included in the 2011 second quarter one-to-four family net loan charge-offs are $12.1 million of charge-offs on $46.9 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2011 second quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. "While we expect NPL levels will remain elevated for some time, especially in those states requiring judicial foreclosure, it is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 76% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less estimated selling costs," Mr. Redman noted.
Future Outlook
Commenting on the near-term outlook, Mr. Redman stated, "The road to sustained U.S. economic growth has proven to be a bumpy one as evidenced by the slower than expected growth and slightly higher unemployment in the 2011 second quarter. And, although the operating environment for residential mortgage portfolio lenders remains challenging, we are optimistic that together, the increase in our loan pipeline, coupled with the anticipated reduction in the expanded conforming loan limits in October 2011 and the resumption of multi-family/commercial real estate lending in the second half of 2011, should facilitate future loan and balance sheet growth in 2011 and strong growth starting in 2012. With interest rates remaining lower than anticipated, and loan repayments and modifications higher than expected, we now project the 2011 margin to be slightly lower than the 2010 margin of 2.35%. We expect capital levels to continue to increase which should support loan and balance sheet growth in the second half of 2011 and next year."

Astoria Financial Corporation Reports Third Quarter and Nine Months Earnings Per Share of $0.12 and $0.58, Respectively
Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share Declared
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 19, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria," the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $11.2 million, or $0.12 diluted earnings per share ("diluted EPS"), for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 compared to net income of $21.5 million, or $0.23 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended September 30, 2010. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, net income totaled $55.4 million, or $0.58 diluted EPS, increases of 11% and 9%, respectively, over net income of $49.9 million, or $0.53 diluted EPS, for the comparable 2010 period. Included in the 2010 nine month period are net charges totaling $3.2 million ($2.1 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), which are not routine to our core operations. For further details, please refer to the "Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures" table included in this release.
Commenting on the 2011 third quarter results, Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, "Our financial results for the quarter were negatively impacted by two events: the decrease in average interest-earning assets by almost $400 million from the 2011 second quarter, due in part to the flattening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve which kept residential mortgage prepayment activity at elevated levels, and a non-cash increase of over $3 million in ESOP expense, due to our lower stock price during the third quarter. On a more positive note, the pace of the decline in the balance sheet and loan portfolio has slowed significantly in the third quarter and we expect to see modest growth in the 2011 fourth quarter, accelerating further in 2012."
Financial Highlights
Low cost savings, money market and checking accounts increased $389.6 million, or 31% annualized, to $5.4 billion, from June 30, 2011 and increased $987.7 million, or 22%, from September 30, 2010.
Early stage loan delinquencies (30-89 days past due) decreased $18.7 million, or 9%, to $188.5 million, from June 30, 2011 and $63.5 million, or 25%, from September 30, 2010.
Total past due loans and REO decreased $23.6 million, or 4%, to $619.2 million, from June 30, 2011 and $97.1 million, or 14%, from September 30, 2010.
The Company's tangible common equity ratio increased to 6.55%, up 9 basis points from June 30, 2011 and 92 basis points from September 30, 2010.
Astoria Federal's leverage and tangible capital ratios increased to 8.75%, up 14 basis points from June 30, 2011 and 116 basis points from September 30, 2010.  
Astoria Federal's Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased to 14.89%, up 41 basis points from June 30, 2011 and 202 basis points from September 30, 2010.  
The residential loan pipeline, excluding our own customer loan refinances, totaled $1.0 billion at September 30, 2011, 28% higher than June 30, 2011
The multi-family loan pipeline totaled $252.7 million at September 30, 2011 versus no pipeline at June 30, 2011
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their October 19, 2011 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2011 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2011. This is the sixty-sixth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Third Quarter and Nine Months Earnings Summary
Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 totaled $90.6 million compared to $95.7 million for the previous quarter and $106.0 million for the 2010 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, net interest income totaled $287.9 million compared to $332.3 million for the comparable 2010 period. The decreases in net interest income are due primarily to decreases in average interest-earning assets of $385.5 million on a linked quarter basis and $2.3 billion for both the year over year quarter and nine month periods and asset yields declining greater than the cost of funds, due to the prolonged low interest rate environment. The net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 was 2.27% compared to 2.34% for the previous quarter and 2.32% for the 2010 third quarter. Approximately 2 basis points of the linked quarter decrease is due to one extra day of interest expense in the 2011 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the net interest margin was 2.34% compared to 2.36% for the comparable 2010 nine month period.
For the quarter ended September 30, 2011, a $10.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded, which was equal to the provision for the previous quarter and 50% lower than the $20.0 million provision recorded for the 2010 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the provision for loan losses totaled $27.0 million compared to $100.0 million for the comparable 2010 period. Mr. Redman noted, "Despite the improved credit metrics of the loan portfolio, including the noted decline in total loan delinquencies, we felt it prudent, at this time, to maintain our strong allowance for loan losses coverage ratio, which was 1.34% of total loans at September 30, 2011."
Non-interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 totaled $16.5 million compared to $17.0 million for the previous quarter and $18.6 million for the 2010 third quarter. Non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 totaled $51.6 million compared to $60.5 million for the comparable 2010 period. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 is due to a $6.2 million gain relating to a litigation settlement recorded in 2010, partially offset by a $1.5 million impairment write-down of premises and equipment recorded in 2010, coupled with a decrease of $3.4 million in customer service fees.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 totaled $78.6 million compared to $76.0 million for the previous quarter and $70.9 million for the 2010 third quarter. The linked quarter increase is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense, primarily a non-cash increase in ESOP expense of over $3 million, due to the lower stock price in the 2011 third quarter, partially offset by lower incentive bonus expense. The quarterly year over year increase is due to a $4.3 million increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense and a $3.5 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, primarily ESOP expense. Mr. Redman stated, "Excluding the increase in the non-cash ESOP expense, G&A expenses remained essentially flat on a linked quarter basis."
For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, G&A expense totaled $224.2 million compared to $215.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increase is due to a $7.8 million increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense, a $7.3 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, primarily ESOP and pension expense, and a $1.8 million increase in advertising expense, partially offset by a $7.9 million litigation settlement expense recorded in 2010.
Balance Sheet Summary
Total assets decreased $143.7 million from June 30, 2011 and $1.1 billion from December 31, 2010 and totaled $17.0 billion at September 30, 2011. The decline is primarily due to a decrease in the loan portfolio. "We believe the decline in the balance sheet has reached an inflection point in the third quarter, evidenced by the smallest quarterly decline in the balance sheet in two years. As previously stated, our expectation for modest loan and balance sheet growth in the 2011 fourth quarter and more significant growth in 2012 is predicated on two factors. The one-to-four family loan pipeline at September 30, 2011, excluding our own customer loan refinances, was $1.0 billion, or 28%, higher than it was at June 30, 2011, which should mitigate the effect of elevated prepayment activity, and the multi-family loan pipeline at September 30, 2011 was $252.7 million and growing, due to the resumption of lending in the 2011 third quarter," Mr. Redman noted.
The one-to-four family portfolio increased $11.4 million from June 30, 2011 to $10.6 billion at September 30, 2011, the first increase in the portfolio in more than two years. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011, one-to-four family loan originations for portfolio totaled $1.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, compared to $646.7 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods. The loan-to-value ratio of the one-to-four family loan production for portfolio for the 2011 third quarter and nine months each averaged approximately 60% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $782,000 and $766,000, respectively. One-to-four family loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011 totaled $892.9 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, compared to $848.3 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods.
The combined multi-family/commercial real estate ("CRE") portfolio totaled $2.4 billion at September 30, 2011 compared to $2.6 billion at June 30, 2011 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2010. Multi-family/CRE loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011 totaled $176.1 million and $502.5 million, respectively, compared to $70.1 million and $186.4 million for the comparable 2010 periods.
The securities portfolio increased $61.7 million from June 30, 2011 and totaled $2.5 billion at September 30, 2011. We expect to maintain the securities portfolio at, or slightly higher than, current levels throughout the remainder of the year.
Deposits increased $56.5 million from June 30, 2011 and decreased $331.9 million from December 31, 2010 to $11.3 billion at September 30, 2011. Importantly, low-cost savings, money market and checking account deposits increased $389.6 million, or 31% annualized, from June 30, 2011 and $618.9 million, or 17% annualized, from December 31, 2010. Certificate of deposit ("CD") accounts (including Liquid CDs) decreased $333.1 million from the previous quarter and $950.7 million from December 31, 2010. Notwithstanding the decline in CDs, during the nine months ended September 30, 2011, we extended $606.5 million of CDs for terms of two years or more in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates. At September 30, 2011, our one-year interest rate sensitivity gap was positive 3.22%.
Borrowings decreased $263.9 million from June 30, 2011 and $846.7 million from December 31, 2010 to $4.0 billion at September 30, 2011.
Stockholders' equity totaled $1.3 billion, or 7.57% of total assets, at September 30, 2011. Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with leverage, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 8.75%, 8.75%, 16.18% and 14.89%, respectively, at September 30, 2011.
Asset Quality
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings of $36.8 million, totaled $380.0 million, or 2.24% of total assets, at September 30, 2011, an increase of $3.7 million from the previous quarter. One-to-four family NPLs totaled $324.9 million, multi-family/CRE/construction NPLs totaled $49.6 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $5.5 million, compared to $329.6 million, $41.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively, at June 30, 2011. Of the $324.9 million of one-to-four family NPLs, $258.7 million, or 80%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
The following table illustrates loan migration trends from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:
The table below details, as of September 30, 2011, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states. More comprehensive state details are included in the "One-to-Four Family Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis" table included in this release.
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2011 totaled $14.4 million and $50.1 million, respectively, down from $24.8 million and $87.8 million, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods. Included in the 2011 third quarter one-to-four family net loan charge-offs are $13.9 million of charge-offs on $59.7 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2011 third quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. "While we expect NPL levels will remain elevated for some time, especially in those states requiring judicial foreclosure, it is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 80% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less estimated selling costs," Mr. Redman noted.
Future Outlook
Commenting on the outlook for the fourth quarter and 2012, Mr. Redman stated, "We continue to operate in a challenging environment; economic growth remains weak, unemployment stubbornly remains elevated and home values continue to remain soft. In addition, the implementation of Operation Twist by the Federal Reserve has contributed to a flattening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, putting further downward pressure on long term interest rates and current mortgage product offerings, as well as increasing mortgage loan prepayments. However, we are optimistic that the increase in our loan pipeline, coupled with the reduction in the expanded conforming loan limits that commenced October 1, 2011 and the resumption of multi-family/commercial real estate lending, should facilitate modest loan and balance sheet growth in the fourth quarter and more robust growth in 2012. With respect to the net interest margin, we expect that, in the current low interest rate environment, with increased loan prepayment activity, the margin for the 2011 fourth quarter will be down slightly from the third quarter and for 2012 may be somewhat lower than the margin for 2011."

Astoria Financial Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Per Share of $0.12 and $0.70, Respectively
Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share Declared; Annual Shareholder Meeting Date Set
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 25, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria," the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $11.8 million, or $0.12 diluted earnings per share ("diluted EPS"), for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 compared to net income of $23.8 million, or $0.25 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net income totaled $67.2 million, or $0.70 diluted EPS compared to net income of $73.7 million, or $0.78 diluted EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2010. The year ended December 31, 2010 includes net charges totaling $3.2 million ($2.1 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), which are not routine to our core operations. For further details, please refer to the "Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures" table included in this release.
Commenting on the 2011 fourth quarter and full year results, Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, "The declines in fourth quarter and full year earnings were due to significant decreases in average interest-earning assets from the comparable 2010 periods, primarily due to declines in both our one-to-four family ("residential") and multi-family and commercial real estate ("CRE") loan portfolios. The decline in the residential loan portfolio was due primarily to the effect of continued elevated levels of mortgage prepayment activity resulting from government programs designed to keep 30-year fixed-rate conforming loan interest rates at historic low levels. The decline in the multi-family/CRE loan portfolio was due to the absence of lending in this market during much of 2011. The resumption of multi-family/CRE lending, which began in the 2011 third quarter and is demonstrating solid growth as evidenced by the fourth quarter originations and year-end pipeline, should help to mitigate the negative impact of U.S. government programs that impede our ability to grow the residential loan portfolio profitably. Accordingly, we anticipate average interest-earning assets to begin increasing modestly in the 2012 first quarter and more robustly as the year progresses."
Full Year Financial Highlights
Low cost savings, money market and checking account deposits increased $910.7 million, or 19%, to $5.7 billion, or 51% of total deposits.
Total non-performing loans decreased $57.8 million, or 15%, to $332.9 million.
The Company's tangible common equity ratio increased 43 basis points to 6.33%.
Astoria Federal's leverage and tangible capital ratios increased 76 basis points to 8.70%.  
Astoria Federal's Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased 147 basis points to 14.80%.  
Residential loan originations for portfolio totaled $3.5 billion, multi-family/CRE loan originations totaled $204.0 million
The Board of Directors of the Company, at their January 25, 2012 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per common share. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2012 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2012. This is the sixty-seventh consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. The Board also established May 16, 2012 as the date for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a voting record date of March 26, 2012.
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.13 Per Share; Sets Annual Shareholder Meeting Date
Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 totaled $87.5 million compared to $90.6 million for the previous quarter and $101.2 million for the 2010 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net interest income totaled $375.4 million compared to $433.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decreases in net interest income for the year over year quarter and full year periods are due primarily to a decline in average interest-earning assets of $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary
The net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 was 2.20% compared to 2.27% for the previous quarter and 2.32% for the 2010 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the net interest margin was 2.30% compared to 2.35% for the year ended December 31, 2010.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2011, a $10.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded, which was equal to the provision for the previous quarter and 33% lower than the $15.0 million provision recorded for the 2010 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2011, the provision for loan losses totaled $37.0 million, 68% lower than the $115.0 million provision for the year ended December 31, 2010.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 totaled $17.3 million compared to $16.5 million for the previous quarter and $20.7 million for the 2010 fourth quarter. Non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $68.9 million compared to $81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2011 is primarily due to a $6.2 million gain relating to a litigation settlement recorded in 2010, a decrease of $5.1 million in customer service fees and net gains of $2.1 million on sales of non-performing loans held-for-sale recorded in 2010, partially offset by a $1.5 million impairment write-down of premises and equipment recorded in 2010.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2011 totaled $77.2 million, a $1.3 million decline from the previous quarter and a $7.3 million increase from the 2010 fourth quarter. The linked quarter decrease is due primarily to decreases in compensation and benefits expense and advertising expense, partially offset by an increase in other expense. The quarterly year over year increase is primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense and a $2.3 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, including a $1.1 million increase in non-cash ESOP expense.
For the year ended December 31, 2011, G&A expense totaled $301.4 million compared to $284.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase is due primarily to a $12.4 million increase in FDIC deposit insurance expense and a $9.6 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, primarily ESOP and pension expense, partially offset by a $7.9 million litigation settlement expense recorded in 2010.
Commenting on plans to restrain future expense growth, Mr. Redman stated, "In an effort to control the growth in G&A expense, due primarily to the impact of higher FDIC deposit insurance expense, increased regulatory compliance expense, pension expense and the additional expenses associated with the resumption of multi-family lending, the Company has initiated several steps that will significantly slow the growth of G&A in 2012 and beyond. Specifically, the Company has instituted a salary freeze, including the exclusion of a corporate incentive bonus and equity compensation awards, for executive and senior officers. Further, the Company has commenced a corporate-wide review of all components of compensation, including retirement plans and staffing levels. These initiatives are expected to essentially keep core G&A expense (excluding any one-time charges associated with these initiatives) similar to the total G&A expense recorded in 2011, despite the higher costs stated above and the projected balance sheet growth."
Expense Control Initiatives
Total assets increased $45.4 million from September 30, 2011 and declined $1.1 billion from December 31, 2010 and totaled $17.0 billion at December 31, 2011. The year over year decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the loan portfolio. "We are pleased to report a slight increase in the balance sheet in the 2011 fourth quarter, primarily from the multi-family/CRE loan closings in December, the first balance sheet increase in more than two years. As previously stated, our expectation for more significant growth in 2012 is predicated on the growth of the multi-family/CRE loan portfolio more than offsetting any decline in the residential loan portfolio. At December 31, 2011, the residential loan pipeline was $1.1 billion and the multi-family/CRE loan pipeline was $396.5 million, and is continuing to grow due to the robust multi-family lending we are now experiencing," Mr. Redman noted.
Balance Sheet Summary
The residential loan portfolio remained essentially unchanged from September 30, 2011 and totaled $10.6 billion at December 31, 2011 compared to $10.9 billion at December 31, 2010. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011, residential loan originations for portfolio totaled $1.1 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, compared to $643.6 million, and $2.9 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods. The loan-to-value ratio of the residential loan production for portfolio for the 2011 fourth quarter and full year averaged approximately 60% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $765,000. Residential loan prepayments for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $996.0 million and $3.3 billion, respectively, compared to $1.0 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods.
The combined multi-family/CRE portfolio remained essentially unchanged from September 30, 2011 and totaled $2.3 billion at December 31, 2011 compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2010. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011, multi-family/CRE loan originations totaled $202.9 million and $204.0 million, respectively. There were no multi-family/CRE loans originated in 2010. Multi-family/CRE loan prepayments for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $182.3 million and $684.8 million, respectively, compared to $112.5 million and $299.0 million for the comparable 2010 periods.
The securities portfolio remained essentially unchanged from September 30, 2011 and totaled $2.5 billion at December 31, 2011 compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2010. We expect to maintain the securities portfolio at, or slightly higher than, current levels throughout 2012.
Deposits remained essentially unchanged from September 30, 2011 and totaled $11.2 billion at December 31, 2011 compared to $11.6 billion at December 31, 2010. Importantly, low-cost savings, money market and checking account deposits increased $291.8 million, or 21% annualized, from September 30, 2011 and $910.7 million, or 19%, from December 31, 2010 to $5.7 billion, or 51% of total deposits as compared to 42% at December 31, 2010. Certificate of deposit ("CD") accounts (including Liquid CDs) decreased $313.3 million from September 30, 2011 and $1.3 billion from December 31, 2010. Notwithstanding the decline in CDs, during the year ended December 31, 2011, we extended $635.4 million of CDs for terms of two years or more in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2011, our one-year interest rate sensitivity gap was positive 1.5%. Borrowings increased slightly from September 30, 2011 and decreased $747.6 million from December 31, 2010 to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2011.
On a linked quarter basis, stockholders' equity declined $33.3 million, primarily due to a $36.0 million other comprehensive loss adjustment to reflect a decrease in the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010. For the full year, stockholders' equity increased $9.4 million to $1.3 billion, or 7.35% of total assets, at December 31, 2011. Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with leverage, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 8.70%, 8.70%, 16.08% and 14.80%, respectively, at December 31, 2011.
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings of $18.8 million, totaled $332.9 million, or 1.96% of total assets, at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $47.1 million from the previous quarter. During the 2011 fourth quarter, $36.5 million of NPLs were either sold or classified as held-for-sale. Residential NPLs totaled $317.9 million, multi-family/CRE/construction NPLs totaled $8.9 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $6.1 million, compared to $324.9 million, $49.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively, at September 30, 2011. Of the $317.9 million of residential NPLs, $256.4 million, or 81%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
Asset Quality
The following table illustrates loan migration trends from 30 days delinquent to 90+ days delinquent:
The table below details, as of December 31, 2011, the ten largest concentrations by state of one-to-four family loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states. More comprehensive state details are included in the "One-to-Four Family Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis" table included in this release.
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2011 totaled $31.2 million and $81.3 million, respectively, compared to $19.7 million and $107.6 million, respectively, for the comparable 2010 periods. Included in the $31.2 million net loan charge-offs are $13.6 million of loan charge-offs related to loans transferred to held-for-sale and specific valuation allowances charged-off in accordance with OCC regulatory guidelines. Included in the 2011 fourth quarter residential net loan charge-offs are $10.8 million of charge-offs on $60.7 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2011 fourth quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. "While we expect NPL levels will remain elevated for some time, especially in those states requiring judicial foreclosure, it is important to note that we believe the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 81% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less estimated selling costs," Mr. Redman noted.
Selected Asset Quality Metrics
(at or for the three months ended December 31, 2011, except as noted)
Commenting on the outlook for 2012, Mr. Redman stated, "We continue to face several headwinds as we enter 2012. Economic growth remains weak, unemployment remains stubbornly elevated and home values continue to remain soft. In addition, the implementation of "Operation Twist" by the Federal Reserve has contributed to a flattening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, putting further downward pressure on long term interest rates and current mortgage product offerings, as well as keeping mortgage loan prepayments at elevated levels. However, we are optimistic that the increase in the multi-family/CRE loan pipeline should facilitate modest loan and balance sheet growth in the first quarter and more robust growth as the year progresses. For 2012, we expect multi-family/CRE loan originations of approximately $1.5 billion and residential loan originations for portfolio of approximately $3.5 billion, assuming market conditions remain stable throughout 2012. With respect to the net interest margin, we expect core deposits will continue to increase in 2012 and that, in the current low interest rate environment, residential loan prepayment activity will remain elevated. Accordingly, we anticipate the margin for 2012 will be relatively similar to the margin for the 2011 fourth quarter."

EXHIBIT INDEX
 
 
 

 
Astoria Financial Corporation
 
Corporate Governance Guidelines
 
The Board of Directors (the Board) of Astoria Financial Corporation (the Corporation) has adopted these Corporate Governance Guidelines (the Guidelines) to assist it in fulfilling its collective responsibilities to the shareholders of the Corporation, to ensure that there is a common understanding among the directors regarding the expectations of the Board with respect to the matters set forth in these Guidelines and to communicate these Guidelines to the Corporations shareholders, officers, employees and others. These Guidelines shall be reviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board from time to time in accordance with the Committees Charter and, when deemed appropriate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall make recommendations to the Board regarding these Guidelines. The Board shall review these Guidelines and recommendations of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee related thereto, if any, and at least annually approve these Corporate Governance Guidelines.
 
 
 
The size of the Board shall be determined based upon an evaluation of the needs of Corporation, the qualifications of any available identified candidates, current Board composition and the need to maintain the Board as a cohesive, efficient working group. The size of the Board will be reviewed from time to time as appropriate by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee which shall make recommendations to the Board as to the Boards size.
 
 
 
 
 
Whole Board means the total number of authorized directorships, whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption.
1
 
 
Each Independent Director shall notify the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as soon as practicable of any change in:
 
 
 
together with an offer to resign his or her seat as a director, if requested by the Board as a result thereof.
 
 
 
The Compensation Committee shall establish stock ownership requirements for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers of the Corporation.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any Director who tenders his or her resignation pursuant to this provision shall not participate in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommendation or Board action regarding whether to accept the resignation offer. However, if each member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee received a Majority Withheld Vote at the same election, then the Independent Directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote shall appoint a committee amongst themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them. However, if the only Directors who did not receive a Majority Withheld Vote in the same election constitute three or fewer Directors, all Directors may participate in the action regarding whether to accept the resignation offers.
 
In a contested election, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders by the holders of shares present in person or by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote in the election. An election shall be considered contested if there are more nominees for election than positions on the board of directors to be filled by election at the meeting.
 
 
The primary responsibility of the directors is to exercise their business judgment and act in what they reasonably believe to be the best interest of the Corporation and its shareholders. In discharging that obligation, directors are entitled to rely on the Corporations management and outside advisors and auditors. In addition to its general oversight of management and the business and affairs of the Corporation, specific duties of the Board include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Board has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the authority and responsibility to manage the day to day business operations of the Corporation in a manner consistent with the policies, standards and plans of the Corporation and any specific instructions or directions of the Board. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for conferring with and seeking, in appropriate situations, the advice and approval of the Board with respect to actions or strategies undertaken by the Corporation. The officers of the Corporation are responsible for communicating with the Board openly and candidly and keeping the Board informed in a manner that allows the directors to adequately perform their duties.
 
The Board believes that it and management should speak with one voice. The policy of the Corporation is to permit only designated officers to communicate with investors, the media, customers and other constituencies of the Corporation regarding the business, affairs and prospects of the Corporation. Information regarding the business, affairs and prospects of the Corporation received by the directors in the course of performing their duties or otherwise shall be treated by them as confidential in accordance with the Corporations policies in this regard.
 
Meetings of the Board shall either be scheduled on a regular basis or, if necessary, sufficiently in advance to allow directors time to prepare, to the extent possible under the circumstances, for the business to be considered at such meetings. Agendas shall be prepared in advance and materials necessary for the directors to adequately prepare for the matters to be considered shall be provided in advance. Directors may request supplemental information necessary for their deliberations, their understanding of the business and operations of the Corporation or their fulfillment of their duties and responsibilities. The Board recognizes that certain items to be discussed at Board or Committee meetings may be of an extremely sensitive nature and that, as a result, distribution of materials on these matters in advance of the Board or Committees meeting may not be appropriate.
 
 
 
The primary responsibility of the Non-management and Independent Directors is to ensure that decisions of the Board are made independent of the influence of those who may have a personal interest in the decisions apart from their interest as a shareholder, or who otherwise might have a conflict of interest in the decision, and to provide a forum for the open discussion of issues related to independent decision-making by the Board. The role of the Non-management or Independent Directors is not to eliminate management from the Board decision-making processes or to usurp the ultimate decision making authority of the Board.
 
At meetings of the Non-management and Independent Directors, the directors present shall, among other things, discuss and evaluate decisions with regard to significant policy issues and strategic matters with personal implications for officer directors (such as stock offerings and merger and acquisition transactions), long-term strategic planning, CEO and other executive officer performance evaluations, succession planning, and other decisions that may potentially raise a conflict of interest for management directors.
 
The presiding director of meetings of the Non-management and Independent Directors will be responsible for the preparation of the agenda for each meeting, in consultation with the other Non-management and Independent Directors. Such presiding director shall serve as the liaison between the Non-management and Independent Directors and management and between such Directors and outside advisors, including legal counsel.
 
Following each meeting of the Non-management or Independent Directors, the presiding director shall report to the Board regarding the meeting and such meeting shall be referenced in the minutes of the applicable Board meeting.
 
Interested parties who wish to communicate with the Non-management or Independent Directors may do so by writing to:
 
 
Non-management Directors are those directors who are not officers of either Astoria Financial Corporation or Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association. Non-management directors may be, but are not required to be, Independent Directors.
2
 
If all Non-management Directors are Independent Directors, the meetings of the Non-management Directors in executive session will satisfy this requirement.

Such communications should be delivered in a sealed envelope marked Personal and Confidential. Such communications shall be delivered unopened by the Senior Executive Vice President, Secretary and Chief Risk Officer to the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
 
 
Each of the aforementioned committees shall have its own charter. Each charter will set forth the purpose, goals and responsibilities of the committee as well as qualifications for committee membership, procedures for committee member appointment and removal, committee structure and operations and committee reports to the Board. Each charter will also provide that the specified committee will annually self-evaluate its performance.
 
The chairman of each committee, in consultation with the committee members, will determine the frequency and length of the committee meetings, to the extent not inconsistent with any requirements set forth in the committees charter or the Corporations Bylaws. The chairman of each committee, in consultation with the appropriate members of the committee and management, will develop the agenda for each committee meeting.
 
The Board may, from time to time, establish or maintain additional committees as necessary or appropriate.
 
 
 
Members of the Board shall also have complete access, either at meetings of the Board or otherwise, to the Corporations outside counsels and independent advisors. In exercising these rights, directors must use reasonable efforts to ensure that their actions will not be distracting or intrusive to the business operations of the Corporation. The Chief Executive Officer should be copied on all written or informed of all oral communication from the directors to the Corporations officers, counsel and independent advisors, unless the circumstances dictate otherwise. The Board and its committees may, at the Corporations expense and without the approval of any officer of the Corporation, retain independent legal, financial and other advisors of their choice with respect to any issue relating to their activities.
 
 
The Compensation Committee shall from time to time make recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of the Board. Changes in the amount or form of compensation received by members of the Board, if any, shall be subject to approval by the entire Board. Compensation directly related to duties as a director, including any additional amounts paid to members and chairs of committees, is the only compensation Audit Committee members may receive from the Corporation.
 
 
 
The Board will be provided with updates on business, legal and regulatory matters that impact the Corporation and the financial services industry generally. In addition, the Corporation shall make available to the directors educational opportunities pertinent to their service as directors, to enable them to better perform their duties and responsibilities and recognize and deal with the varied issues that might arise during their tenure as directors.
 
 
 
The Board is responsible for planning for succession with respect to the position of Chief Executive Officer and other positions deemed critical to the Corporation. Such planning shall occur with the assistance of management and the recommendations from time to time of the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall review the succession plan of the Corporation no less frequently than annually and may make recommendations to the Board regarding key individuals as appropriate.
 
 
 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in accordance with its Charter, is responsible for receiving comments, including self-evaluations, from the Board membership, reviewing such comments and reporting annually to the Board an assessment of the Boards performance as a whole. The Board will consider the evaluation report annually which will include an analysis of the Boards core competencies, including understanding of the financial industry, financial expertise, integrity, wisdom, judgment, commitment to excellence, business experience and acumen, individual and collective skills, diverse perspectives and availability. The assessment will focus on maximizing the Boards contribution to the overall success of the Corporation.
 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall also review responses to a self/peer review provided by each director to assist the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in ascertaining the quality of the performance of each individual director. The Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will if necessary review with the Chairman of the Board the performance of any individual director who the Committee believes is not fully or adequately performing the duties and responsibilities of a director. These reviews shall also be considered during the director nomination process.

Astoria Financial Corporation Reports First Quarter Earnings Per Share of $0.11
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., April 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria", the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $10.0 million, or $0.11 diluted earnings per share ("diluted EPS") for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 compared to net income of $27.4 million, or $0.29 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. The quarter ended March 31, 2012 includes net charges totaling $3.4 million ($2.2 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), representing severance related expenses associated with cost control initiatives implemented in the 2012 first quarter.
Commenting on the first quarter results, Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, "I am pleased to report robust multi-family/commercial real estate ("MF/CRE") lending in the first quarter which fueled growth in the loan portfolio, the first such growth in several years. The strength of the MF/CRE loan production, as reflected in the significant increase in the loan pipeline since year-end, has exceeded our expectations and reinforces our confidence that MF/CRE lending will be an important contributor to growth in interest earning assets during the year, driving earnings growth and improved overall profitability."
First Quarter Financial Highlights
Low cost savings, money market and checking account deposits increased $176.1 million, or 12% annualized, from December 31, 2011 to $5.9 billion, or 53% of total deposits.
Early stage loan delinquencies (30-89 days) declined $52.2 million, or 24%, from December 31, 2011 to $163.3 million.  
Total loan delinquencies (30 days or more past due) and real estate owned, net, declined $37.6 million, or 6%, from December 31, 2011 to $558.8 million.
MF/CRE loan originations totaled $344.3 million, up 70% from the 2011 fourth quarter.
MF/CRE loan pipeline increased 101% from December 31, 2011 to $798.6 million.
The Board of Directors of the Company, at its April 18, 2012 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per common share. The dividend is payable on June 1, 2012 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2012. This is the sixty-eighth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share
Commenting on the dividend action, Mr. Redman stated, "The Board's decision to reduce the dividend is based on, among other things, the current payout ratio in relation to current earnings and the desire to bring the payout ratio and dividend yield more in line with norms in the financial industry. In addition, the Board believes this action will provide management with added flexibility to redeploy capital to support future loan and balance sheet growth in light of the opportunities available in multi-family lending, which has demonstrated better than expected strength."
Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 totaled $88.2 million compared to $87.5 million for the previous quarter and $101.5 million for the 2011 first quarter. The net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 was 2.20%, unchanged from the previous quarter and 20 basis points lower than the 2011 first quarter. The year over year declines were due primarily to a more rapid decline in the yield on average interest earning assets than the cost of interest bearing liabilities during 2011.
First Quarter Earnings Summary
For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, a $10.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded, the same amount as in the previous quarter and up from the $7.0 million provision recorded for the 2011 first quarter. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans, or the coverage ratio, at 1.12% at March 31, 2012, remains strong.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 totaled $19.6 million compared to $17.3 million for the previous quarter and $18.0 million for the 2011 first quarter. The linked quarter and year over year increases are primarily due to a gain on sales of securities for the 2012 first quarter. In addition, other non-interest income increased and customer service fees and mortgage banking income, net, declined for the 2012 first quarter compared to the 2011 first quarter.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 totaled $82.2 million compared to $77.2 million for the previous quarter and $69.6 million for the 2011 first quarter. The linked quarter increase of $5.0 million is due primarily to increased compensation and benefits expense, resulting from net charges of $3.4 million representing severance related expenses and an increase of $1.7 million in pension and other post-retirement benefits expense. The year over year increase of $12.6 million is due to a $5.7 million increase in FDIC expense and a $5.6 million increase in compensation and benefits expense, primarily due to the severance and pension and other post-retirement benefits expense noted above.
Commenting on G&A expenses, Mr. Redman noted, "During the first quarter, we completed the cost control initiatives announced earlier this year which were necessary to significantly slow the growth of G&A expenses in 2012 and beyond. In addition to the salary freeze for executive and senior officers and the elimination of stock-based compensation awards for 2012 announced in January, the Company completed a review of staffing levels in February which resulted in the elimination of 142 positions. In addition, effective April 30, 2012, we will implement a freeze in all defined benefit pension programs. As a result of these actions, we expect the second quarter G&A expense will return to a more normal run rate of approximately $75.0 million per quarter with the exception of a one-time additional expense of approximately $2.0 million, expected to be recorded in the second half of 2012, related to the settlement of employment agreements associated with previously announced executive retirements."
Expense Control Initiatives
Total assets increased slightly from December 31, 2011 and totaled $17.1 billion at March 31, 2012. The loan portfolio increased $106.0 million from December 31, 2011 and totaled $13.4 billion at March 31, 2012. Commenting on the loan and balance sheet growth, Mr. Redman stated, "As anticipated, the balance sheet expanded in the first quarter and the loan portfolio grew for the first time in several years, fueled by growth in the MF/CRE portfolios. With the MF/CRE lending now operating at full throttle, as evidenced by the $1.1 billion of MF/CRE loan applications taken in the last six months, the closing of more than $540 million of loans during the same period and the strong MF/CRE loan pipeline which totaled almost $800 million at March 31, 2012, we expect continued growth in the MF/CRE portfolios which should lead to consistent balance sheet growth going forward."
Balance Sheet Summary
The one-to-four family (residential) loan portfolio decreased $16.2 million from December 31, 2011 to $10.5 billion at March 31, 2012. For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, residential loan originations for portfolio totaled $880.4 million compared to $707.4 million for the comparable 2011 period. The loan-to-value ratio of the residential loan production for portfolio for the 2012 first quarter averaged approximately 59% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $747,000. Residential loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 totaled $766.7 million, a 23% decline from the previous quarter and down from $786.2 million for the comparable 2011 period. "Although residential loan prepayments decreased from the previous quarter, they remain at elevated levels. Importantly, they have not accelerated despite the low mortgage rate environment, which has helped stem the decline in the residential loan portfolio," Mr. Redman noted. At March 31, 2012, the residential loan pipeline totaled $1.1 billion.
The combined MF/CRE portfolio increased $129.6 million, or 22% on an annualized basis, from December 31, 2011 to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2012. For the quarter ended March 31, 2012, MF/CRE loan originations totaled $344.3 million with loan-to-value ratios averaging approximately 52% at origination. There were no multi-family/CRE loans originated in the 2011 first quarter. MF/CRE loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 totaled $192.3 million compared to $193.1 million for the comparable 2011 period. At March 31, 2012, the MF/CRE pipeline totaled $798.6 million.
The securities portfolio remained essentially unchanged from December 31, 2011 and totaled $2.5 billion at March 31, 2012. The Company expects to maintain the securities portfolio at current levels throughout 2012.
Deposits decreased $133.0 million from December 31, 2011 to $11.1 billion at March 31, 2012. The decrease was entirely the result of a $309.1 million decrease in certificate of deposits, as the Bank reflected an increase of $176.1 million in low-cost savings, money market and checking accounts, which totaled $5.9 billion, or 53% of total deposits at March 31, 2012.
Stockholders' equity increased $19.1 million to $1.3 billion, or 7.42% of total assets, at March 31, 2012. Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with leverage, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 8.75%, 8.75%, 16.19% and 14.92%, respectively, at March 31, 2012.
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") of $43.5 million, totaled $355.6 million, or 2.08% of total assets, at March 31, 2012, an increase of $22.7 million from the previous quarter, due primarily to an increase in TDRs. Residential NPLs totaled $312.2 million, MF/CRE NPLs totaled $36.9 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $6.4 million at March 31, 2012 compared to $317.9 million, $8.9 million and $6.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Of the $312.2 million of residential NPLs, $258.4 million, or 83%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
Asset Quality
The following table illustrates loan migration trends from 30 days delinquent to 90 days and over delinquent:
The table below details, as of March 31, 2012, the ten largest concentrations by state of residential loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states. More comprehensive state details are included in the "One-to-Four Family Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis" table included in this release.
Net loan charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 totaled $17.3 million (including $16.1 million of residential loans and $693,000 of MF/CRE loans) compared to $31.2 million (including $12.2 million of residential loans and $18.4 million of MF/CRE loans) for the previous quarter. Included in the $16.1 million of residential net loan charge-offs are $10.9 million of charge-offs on $46.6 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2012 first quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less selling costs. "While we expect NPL levels will remain elevated for some time, it is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 83% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less selling costs," Mr. Redman noted.
Future Outlook 
Commenting on the future outlook, Mr. Redman stated, "Our goal for 2012 is to demonstrate consistent loan and balance sheet growth and improved operating efficiency, as well as to reposition the asset/liability mix, concentrating more on higher yielding multifamily loans than on lower yielding residential loans, and reducing higher cost CDs and increasing lower cost savings, money market and checking deposits. With the MF/CRE lending operation now operating at full throttle, we anticipate that interest earning assets will continue to accelerate throughout the year which will help fuel earnings growth. Our outlook for the net interest margin remains consistent with our outlook at the end of 2011, which is that we anticipate the 2012 full year margin will be similar to the 2011 fourth and 2012 first quarters net interest margin of 2.20%. As I previously stated, 2012 continues to be the transitional year for us with continued quarterly earnings and balance sheet growth."

Explanatory Note
 
On May 18, 2011, Astoria Financial Corporation (the Company) filed a Current Report on Form 8-K to report on the voting results of its annual meeting of shareholders held on May 18, 2011 (the Meeting), including, among other matters, the results of the non-binding advisory vote regarding the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes on the compensation paid to the Companys named executive officers. On May 25, 2011, the Company filed an Amendment on Form 8-K/A to correct and accurately reflect the Broker Non-Votes reported for each proposal at the Meeting.
 
The Company is filing this Amendment No. 2 on Form8-K/A solely to update, in accordance with Item 5.07(d) of Form 8-K, the disclosures made regarding the vote on the frequency of future shareholder advisory votes on named executive officer compensation.
 
Item 5.07 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
 
At the Meeting, the Companys shareholders voted, in a non-binding advisory vote, for an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation to be held every year, rather than every two or every three years, consistent with the recommendation of the Companys Board of Directors (the Board). In light of such vote and consistent with the Boards recommendation set forth in the Proxy Statement for the Meeting, the Company intends to hold a shareholder advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every year, until such time as another advisory vote is held, in accordance with Section 14A(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on the frequency of advisory votes on named executive officer compensation.

In the news release, Astoria Financial Corporation Reports Second Quarter Earnings Per Share Of $0.13, issued 18-Jul-2012 by Astoria Financial Corporation over PR Newswire, we are advised by the company that the first paragraph of the Future Outlook section, last sentence, should read "...we now anticipate the net interest margin for the 2012 full year to be slightly lower than the 2011 fourth quarter margin of 2.20%." rather than "...we now anticipate the net interest margin for the 2012 full year to be slightly lower than the 2011 full year margin of 2.20%." as originally issued inadvertently. The complete, corrected release follows:
Astoria Financial Corporation Reports Second Quarter Earnings Per Share Of $0.13
Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share Declared
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., July 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria", the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $12.8 million, or $0.13 diluted earnings per share ("diluted EPS"), for the quarter ended June 30, 2012, compared to net income of $16.8 million, or $0.18 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended June 30, 2011. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, net income totaled $22.8 million, or $0.24 diluted EPS, compared to net income of $44.2 million, or $0.46 diluted EPS, for the comparable 2011 period. Included in the 2012 six months results are net charges totaling $3.4 million ($2.2 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), reported in the 2012 first quarter, representing severance related expenses associated with cost control initiatives implemented in the 2012 first quarter.
Second Quarter Financial Highlights
Low cost core deposits, consisting of savings, money market and checking accounts, increased $262.6 million, or 18% annualized, from March 31, 2012 to $6.2 billion, or 58% of total deposits, at June 30, 2012.
Combined multi-family/commercial real estate ("MF/CRE") loan portfolio increased $361.2 million, or 58% annualized, from March 31, 2012 to $2.8 billion at June 30, 2012. 
Total loan delinquencies (30 days or more past due) and real estate owned decreased $19.8 million, or   14% annualized, from March 31, 2012 to $539.1 million at June 30, 2012.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 decreased $10.1 million, or 12%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2012, to $72.1 million.
Commenting on the second quarter results, Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated,"I am pleased to report continued growth in both the loan portfolio and balance sheet this quarter, fueled by an increase in the multi-family loan portfolio. In addition, the results of the cost control initiatives undertaken in the first quarter have produced a significant reduction in operating expenses this quarter. I am also pleased with the positive progression in our asset/liability repositioning. Multi-family/commercial real estate loans increased 21% from December 31, 2011, while residential loans remained relatively stable, and low-cost core deposits increased 8%, while high-cost CDs decreased 18%. We expect that together, the growth and repositioning of the balance sheet coupled with improved operating efficiency should benefit the net interest margin and improve profitability throughout the remainder of the year."
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share
The Board of Directors of the Company, at its July 18, 2012 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per common share. The dividend is payable on September 1, 2012 to shareholders of record as of August 15, 2012. This is the sixty-ninth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Sale of Senior Notes Completed
On June 19, 2012, the Company completed the sale of $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2017 ("5% Senior Notes"). The net proceeds from the sale will be used to repay its existing $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2012 ("5.75% Senior Notes"), which will reduce the Company's annual interest expense by approximately $2.0 million.
Second Quarter and Six Months Earnings Summary
Net interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 totaled $86.7 million compared to $88.2 million for the previous quarter and $95.7 million for the 2011 second quarter. The net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 was 2.14% compared to 2.20% for the previous quarter and 2.34% for the 2011 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, net interest income totaled $174.9 million, compared to $197.3 million for the comparable 2011 period, and the net interest margin was 2.17% for the six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to 2.37% for the six months ended June 30, 2011. The linked quarter and year over year decreases in net interest income and the net interest margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012 are due primarily to a more rapid decline in the yields on average interest-earning assets than the decline in the costs of average interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, the short-term negative carry from the issuance of the Company's 5% Senior Notes reduced the margin two basis points in the 2012 second quarter. Commenting on the margin, Mr. Redman noted, "The lower cost of deposits and borrowings at June 30, 2012 compared to the average costs for the 2012 second quarter coupled with the fact that more than half of the multi-family loan closings in the 2012 second quarter occurred in June is indicative of the future benefit that should accrue to the net interest margin. These benefits will be partially offset in the 2012 third quarter by the carrying cost for the recently issued 5% Senior Notes, the proceeds of which will repay our existing 5.75% Senior Notes, due October 2012."
For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, a $10.0 million provision for loan losses was recorded compared to $10.0 million for both the previous quarter and the 2011 second quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, the provision for loan losses totaled $20.0 million compared to $17.0 million for the comparable 2011 period.
Non-interest income for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 totaled $15.5 million compared to $17.0 million for the 2011 second quarter. The decrease from the 2011 second quarter is due primarily to lower customer service fees, partially offset by an increase in mortgage banking income, net. Non-interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 totaled $35.0 million compared to $35.1 million for the comparable 2011 period.
G&A expense for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 declined $10.1 million, or 12%, from the previous quarter and $3.9 million, or 5%, from the 2011 second quarter, to $72.1 million, primarily due to reduced compensation and benefits expense. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, G&A expense increased $8.7 million, or 6%, to $154.3 million from $145.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011. The six month increase is primarily due to increased FDIC expense. Commenting on the linked quarter improvement in expenses, Mr. Redman stated, "The significant decline in operating expenses this quarter is a direct result of the cost control initiatives implemented in the 2012 first quarter, which should continue to benefit operating efficiency and profitability in the future."
Balance Sheet Summary
Total assets increased $551.4 million from December 31, 2011 and totaled $17.6 billion at June 30, 2012. Included in the increase is the proceeds from the 5% Senior Notes issued in June 2012. The loan portfolio increased $446.5 million from December 31, 2011 and totaled $13.7 billion at June 30, 2012. Commenting on the loan and balance sheet growth, Mr. Redman stated, "As anticipated, the balance sheet and loan portfolio continued to grow in the second quarter, fueled by strong MF/CRE loan production. During the first six months of this year, we closed nearly $900 million of MF/CRE loans with loan to value ratios averaging 54% and average balances of $3.4 million. With a MF/CRE loan pipeline of approximately $560 million at June 30, 2012, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of originating in excess of $1.5 billion of MF/CRE loans this year, which should continue to drive loan and balance sheet growth this year."
The residential (one-to-four family) portfolio totaled $10.5 billion at June 30, 2012 compared to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2011. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012, residential loan originations for portfolio totaled $896.0 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, compared to $636.2 million and $1.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2011 periods. The loan-to-value ratio of the residential loan production for portfolio for the 2012 second quarter and six months each averaged approximately 60% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $732,000 and $740,000, respectively. Residential loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012 totaled $794.8 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, compared to $610.5 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2011 periods.
The MF/CRE portfolios increased $490.7 million, or 21%, from December 31, 2011 to $2.8 billion at June 30, 2012, due to the significant volume of loan closings in the first half of 2012. For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012, MF/CRE loan originations for portfolio totaled $549.3 million and $893.5 million, respectively. No MF/CRE loans were originated in the first half of 2011. MF/CRE loan prepayments for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012 totaled $174.0 million and $366.4 million, respectively, compared to $133.3 million and $326.4 million for the comparable 2011 periods.
The securities portfolio declined $103.3 million, or 4%, from December 31, 2011 and totaled $2.4 billion at June 30, 2012. The Company expects to maintain the securities portfolio at this approximate level throughout 2012.
Deposits decreased $531.4 million from December 31, 2011 to $10.7 billion at June 30, 2012 due to a decrease of $970.2 million in high cost CDs, offset by an increase of $438.7 million, or 15% annualized, in low cost core deposits from December 31, 2011. Core deposits totaled $6.2 billion, or 58% of total deposits, at June 30, 2012. "The growth in core deposits is a result of our efforts to reposition our asset and liability mix. The linked quarter increase in core deposits includes a $32.2 million, or 30% annualized, increase in business deposits. Mr. Redman, commenting on business banking activity, stated, "During the 2012 first quarter, we initiated our business banking expansion to build business relationships and broaden our reach in the communities we serve by helping businesses improve cash flow. This expansion is expected to generate new core relationships within the community and deepen our existing relationships. The results of our efforts, though in the early stages, are beginning to materialize, as evidenced by the growth in business deposits." Notwithstanding the decline in CDs during the first half of 2012, we extended $277.1 million of CDs for terms of two years or more in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates. At June 30, 2012, our one-year interest rate sensitivity gap was positive 6.59%.
Borrowings totaled $5.2 billion at June 30, 2012, an increase of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2011, In addition to the issuance of the 5% Senior Notes in June 2012, the increase also included $600.0 million of fixed-rate FHLB term advances, of which $500.0 million occurred in the 2012 second quarter, with an average term of 3.6 years and an average cost of 1.05%. Commenting on the borrowing activity, Mr. Redman stated, "During this period of historic low interest rates, we utilize low cost long-term borrowings to offset the decline in high cost CDs to help manage interest rate risk."
Stockholders' equity totaled $1.3 billion, or 7.32% of total assets at June 30, 2012. Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with leverage, tangible, total risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 8.60%, 8.60%, 15.69% and 14.41%, respectively, at June 30, 2012.
Asset Quality
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") of $45.0 million, totaled $343.3 million, or 1.95% of total assets, at June 30, 2012 compared to $355.6 million (including TDRs of $43.5 million), or 2.08% of total assets, at March 31, 2012. Residential NPLs totaled $294.8 million, MF/CRE NPLs totaled $41.7 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $6.9 million at June 30, 2012 compared to $312.2 million, $36.9 million and $6.4 million, respectively, at March 31, 2012. Of the $294.8 million of residential NPLs, $256.5 million, or 87%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed, and charged-off as needed to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
The following table illustrates a two-year migration trend for loan delinquencies:
The table below details, as of June 30, 2012, the ten largest concentrations by state of residential loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states. More comprehensive state details are included in the "Residential Loan Portfolio-Geographic Analysis" table included in this release.
Included in $9.7 million of residential net loan charge-offs in the 2012 second quarter are $9.3 million of charge-offs on $62.2 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2012 second quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. "While we expect NPL levels will remain elevated for some time, especially in those states requiring judicial foreclosure, it is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 87% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less estimated selling costs," Mr. Redman noted.
Future Outlook
Commenting on the future outlook, Mr. Redman stated, "As we continue to grow the loan portfolio and balance sheet, we expect to continue our focus on repositioning the asset/liability mix, concentrating more on higher yielding multi-family loans than on lower yielding residential loans, and reducing high cost CDs and increasing low cost core deposits. We also anticipate that interest-earning assets will continue to increase throughout the year which will help fuel earnings growth. With respect to the net interest margin, due to the impact of extending $500 million of borrowings in the 2012 second quarter and the additional short-term cost to carry the 5% Senior Notes until we extinguish our existing 5.75% Senior Notes, we now anticipate the net interest margin for the 2012 full year to be slightly lower than the 2011 fourth quarter margin of 2.20%.
As I previously stated, 2012 continues to be the transitional year for us with continued quarterly earnings and balance sheet growth."

Astoria Financial Corporation Reports 17% Increase In Third Quarter Earnings Per Share To $0.14
Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share Declared
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Oct. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria," the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $13.4 million, or $0.14 diluted earnings per share ("diluted EPS"), for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, increases of 20% and 17%, respectively, compared to net income of $11.2 million, or $0.12 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended September 30, 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net income totaled $36.2 million, or $0.38 diluted EPS, compared to net income of $55.4 million, or $0.58 diluted EPS, for the comparable 2011 period.
Third Quarter Highlights
Net income and diluted EPS up from both prior quarter and same period one year earlier
Cost control initiatives continue to benefit operating efficiency
Higher-yielding multi-family/commercial real estate loans continue to become a larger percentage of the loan portfolio
Core deposits continue to become a larger percentage of deposit liabilities
Non-performing assets continue to improve
$250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes redeemed on September 13, 2012
Commenting on the 2012 third quarter results, Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated,"I am pleased to report improvement in quarterly earnings, both on a linked quarter basis and as compared to the prior year. Our focus on controlling operating expenses has resulted in a positive contribution to earnings, while efforts to reposition both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet continue to progress, and asset quality continues to improve. It is important to note that the improvement in earnings was achieved even though we carried an additional $250 million of senior notes for much of the quarter. This additional carry reflected the timing gap between completion of our 5% senior note issuance in June and repayment of our previously outstanding senior notes in September. The additional carry had a negative impact on the 2012 third quarter net interest margin of approximately nine basis points. In addition, our operating expense level for the 2012 third quarter included $1.2 million in early extinguishment charges associated with the repayment of the 5.75% senior notes."
The Board of Directors of the Company, at its October 17, 2012 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per common share. The dividend is payable on December 1, 2012 to shareholders of record as of November 15, 2012. This is the seventieth consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company.
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share
Net interest income for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 totaled $86.0 million compared to $86.7 million for the previous quarter and $90.6 million for the 2011 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net interest income totaled $260.9 million compared to $287.9 million for the comparable 2011 period. The net interest margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 was 2.09% compared to 2.14% for the previous quarter and 2.27% for the 2011 third quarter. The short-term interest carry associated with the $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2017 ("5% Senior Notes") issued in June 2012 for purposes of repaying the Company's previously outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Notes due October 2012 ("5.75% Senior Notes") had the effect of reducing the 2012 third quarter net interest income by approximately $2.5 million, and had a negative impact on the net interest margin for the 2012 third quarter of approximately nine basis points. The 5.75% Senior Notes were repaid on September 13, 2012. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the net interest margin was 2.15% compared to 2.34% for the comparable 2011 period.
Third Quarter and Nine Months Earnings Summary
For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, a $9.5 million provision for loan losses was recorded, which compares to $10.0 million for both the previous quarter and the 2011 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, the provision for loan losses totaled $29.5 million compared to $27.0 million for the comparable 2011 period.
Non-interest income totaled $16.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2012, up $1.1 million from the previous quarter and essentially unchanged from the 2011 third quarter. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, non-interest income totaled $51.6 million, essentially unchanged from the comparable 2011 period.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2012 totaled $72.6 million compared to $72.1 million for the previous quarter and $78.6 million for the 2011 third quarter. Included in the 2012 third quarter is a $1.2 million expense related to the early extinguishment of debt. The year over year quarter decline is due primarily to reduced compensation and benefits expense as a result of the cost control initiatives implemented in the 2012 first quarter.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, G&A expense totaled $226.9 million compared to $224.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The 2012 nine month period includes, in addition to the expense related to the early extinguishment of debt, net charges totaling $3.4 million representing severance related expenses associated with cost control initiatives implemented in the 2012 first quarter. As a part of those cost control initiatives, a non-recurring expense of approximately $2.0 million, related to the settlement of employment agreements associated with previously announced executive retirements, will be incurred in the 2012 fourth quarter.
Total assets decreased $535.3 million from June 30, 2012 and increased $16.1 million from December 31, 2011 and totaled $17.0 billion at September 30, 2012. The linked quarter decline is due to the redemption of the Company's 5.75% Senior Notes in September 2012 and a decrease in both the loan and securities portfolios.
Balance Sheet Summary
The residential (one-to-four family) loan portfolio decreased $292.7 million from June 30, 2012 to $10.2 billion at September 30, 2012. The decline was due to the pace of residential mortgage loan prepayments exceeding the pace of residential loan origination volume resulting from a further decline in the interest rate for 30-year fixed rate conforming loans during the quarter, thereby making the hybrid ARM product less attractive to borrowers. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2012, residential loan originations for portfolio totaled $513.3 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, compared to $1.0 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2011 periods. The third quarter decline in residential loan originations reflects reduced demand for jumbo hybrid ARM loans. The loan-to-value ratio of the residential loan production for portfolio for the 2012 third quarter and nine months averaged approximately 61% and 60%, respectively, at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $715,000 and $734,000, respectively. Residential loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2012 totaled $692.2 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, compared to $892.9 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2011 periods. "We expect the level of residential loan prepayments to continue to remain elevated and residential ARM production to remain tepid as 30-year fixed rate mortgage interest rates are expected to remain at historic lows for some time," Mr. Redman noted.
The combined multi-family and commercial real estate ("MF/CRE") portfolios increased $132.9 million, or 5%, from June 30, 2012 and $623.6 million, or 26%, from December 31, 2011 to $3.0 billion at September 30, 2012, and represents 22% of the total loan portfolio. For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2012, MF/CRE loan originations totaled $333.9 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, compared to just $1.1 million for each of the comparable 2011 periods, reflecting the resumption of such lending in the 2011 third quarter. The $1.2 billion of MF/CRE loans originated during the first nine months of 2012 have loan to value ratios averaging 53% at origination and balances averaging $3.2 million with a weighted average coupon of 3.67%. Commenting on the loan volume, Mr. Redman noted, "As anticipated, MF/CRE loan origination volume was lower on a linked quarter basis due primarily to seasonality, as the second and fourth quarters traditionally reflect stronger MF/CRE loan origination volume. With a loan pipeline of approximately $500 million at September 30, 2012, we are well poised to exceed our goal of originating in excess of $1.5 billion of MF/CRE loans this year." MF/CRE loan prepayments for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2012 totaled $177.8 million and $544.2 million, respectively, compared to $176.1 million and $502.5 million for the comparable 2011 periods.
The securities portfolio declined $92.9 million, or 4%, from June 30, 2012 and $196.2 million, or 8% from December 31, 2011 and totaled $2.3 billion at September 30, 2012.
Deposits decreased $175.3 million from June 30, 2012 and $706.7 million from December 31, 2011, due to decreases of $224.5 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, in high cost CDs, offset by an increase of $49.2 million and $488.0 million, respectively, in low cost core deposits, to $10.5 billion at September 30, 2012. Core deposits totaled $6.2 billion, or 59% of total deposits, at September 30, 2012. The growth in core deposits is a result of our efforts to reposition the mix of both assets and liabilities. Business deposits for the first nine months of 2012 increased 13% and totaled $497.2 million at September 30, 2012. Mr. Redman, commenting on the growth in business banking, stated, "Our business banking expansion initiatives are generating new core relationships within the community and deepening our existing relationships while helping to facilitate the growth in low cost core deposits."
Borrowings decreased $363.9 million from June 30, 2012 and increased $687.8 million from December 31, 2011 to $4.8 billion at September 30, 2012. Excluding the newly-issued 5.00% Senior Notes, during the first nine months of 2012, we extended $700.0 million of borrowings with a weighted average rate of 1.05% and a weighted average term of 46 months. In addition, notwithstanding the decline in CDs, during the first nine months of 2012, we extended $581.6 million of CDs for terms of two years or more. These transactions were initiated in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates.
Stockholders' equity totaled $1.3 billion, or 7.60% of total assets, at September 30, 2012. Astoria Federal continues to be designated as well-capitalized with leverage, tangible, risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 8.86%, 8.86%, 15.90% and 14.64%, respectively, at September 30, 2012.
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings of $28.6 million, totaled $322.2 million, or 1.89% of total assets, at September 30, 2012, a decrease of $21.1 million from the previous quarter. Residential NPLs totaled $294.7 million, multi-family/CRE/construction NPLs totaled $21.4 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $6.1 million, compared to $294.8 million, $41.7 million and $6.9 million, respectively, at June 30, 2012. Of the $294.7 million of residential NPLs, $244.5 million, or 83%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.

(1) Includes home equity loans of $237.8 million (2) Includes $72.7 million of net unamortized premiums and deferred loan costs (3) Includes $244.5 million of NPLs reviewed, and charged-off as needed, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter (4) Includes TDRs of $9.4 million (5) Includes TDRs of $1.9 million (6) Does not foot due to rounding
Included in the 2012 third quarter residential net loan charge-offs are $4.9 million of charge-offs on $27.5 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2012 third quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. "While the trend of lower NPLs is continuing, we expect NPL levels will remain somewhat elevated for some time, especially in those states requiring judicial foreclosure. It is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 83% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less estimated selling costs," Mr. Redman noted.
Commenting on the outlook for the fourth quarter and 2013, Mr. Redman stated, "With the yield curve flattening further due to the Federal Reserve's extension of "Operation Twist" and the outlook for rates to remain at historic lows for the next several years, we continue to face headwinds. This notwithstanding, we are confident that our strong multi-family loan origination platform coupled with our focus on repositioning our assets and liabilities, from lower yielding residential loans to higher yielding MF/CRE loans and from higher cost CDs to lower cost core deposits, will benefit the net interest margin and enhance future earnings. MF/CRE loans now represent 22% of the overall loan portfolio, up from 18% at year-end 2011 and core deposits now represent 59% of total deposits, up from 51% at year-end 2011."

Astoria Financial Corporation Reports Fourth Quarter Earnings And Full Year Earnings Per Share Of $0.17 And $0.55, Respectively
Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share Declared; Sets Annual Shareholder Meeting Date
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., Jan. 23, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria," the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $16.9 million, or $0.17 diluted earnings per share ("diluted EPS"), for the quarter ended December 31, 2012, compared to net income of $11.8 million, or $0.12 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended December 31, 2011. For the year ended December 31, 2012, net income totaled $53.1 million, or $0.55 diluted EPS, compared to net income of $67.2 million, or $0.70 diluted EPS, for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Included in the 2012 fourth quarter net income is a $6.0 million ($3.9 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax) gain resulting from the sale of the Company's entire holdings of Freddie Mac preferred stock and a $2.2 million ($1.4 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax) charge related to the previously announced settlement of employment agreements associated with executive retirements in the 2012 first quarter. Also included in the 2012 full year net income are net charges totaling $3.4 million, ($2.2 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), representing severance related expenses associated with cost control initiatives implemented in the 2012 first quarter and a $1.2 million expense ($785,000, or $0.01 per share, after-tax) related to the early extinguishment of debt in the 2012 third quarter.
Financial Highlights
Loan Portfolio Shift Continues: Higher-yielding multi-family/commercial real estate loans ("MF/CRE") continue to become a larger percentage of the loan portfolio; increased to 24% of total loans from 18% a year ago.
Greater Core Deposit Concentration: Lower cost core deposits continue to become a larger percentage of deposit liabilities; increased to 62% of total deposits from 51% a year ago; business deposits increased 12% from a year ago to $489.3 million.
Cost Control Initiatives Continue to Benefit Operating Efficiency.
Delinquent Loans, Non-performing Loans and REO Continue to Decline.
Commenting on the 2012 fourth quarter results, Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria, stated, "I am pleased to report continued improvements in the asset and liability mix which reflect our success in repositioning the balance sheet from lower yielding residential mortgage loans to higher yielding MF/CRE loans and from higher cost CD accounts to lower cost core deposits. These efforts had a positive benefit on the net interest margin. Additionally, our focus on controlling operating expenses and continued improvement in asset quality provides a positive contribution to earnings."
The Board of Directors of the Company, at its January 23, 2013 meeting, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per common share. The dividend is payable on March 1, 2013 to shareholders of record as of February 15, 2013. This is the seventy-first consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared by the Company. The Board also established May 15, 2013 as the date for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, with a voting record date of March 25, 2013.
Board Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share; Sets Annual Shareholder Meeting Date
Net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 totaled $87.4 million compared to $86.0 million for the previous quarter and $87.5 million for the 2011 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2012, net interest income totaled $348.3 million compared to $375.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The net interest margin for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 was 2.21% compared to 2.09% for the previous quarter and 2.20% for the 2011 fourth quarter. The margin for the previous quarter was negatively impacted by approximately nine basis points due to the additional short-term carrying cost of an additional $250 million of senior notes whose proceeds were used to repay the Company's 5.75% senior notes in September. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the net interest margin was 2.16% compared to 2.30% for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary
For the quarter ended December 31, 2012, a $10.9 million provision for loan losses was recorded, which compares to $9.5 million for the previous quarter and $10.0 million for the comparable 2011 quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the provision for loan losses totaled $40.4 million compared to $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Non-interest income totaled $21.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 compared to $16.6 million for the previous quarter and $17.3 million for the 2011 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2012, non-interest income totaled $73.2 million compared to $68.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The 2012 fourth quarter and full year non-interest income includes a $6.0 million gain on sale of securities resulting from the sale of the Company's Freddie Mac preferred stock in the 2012 fourth quarter. The sale of the stock, which had been written off in prior years as an impaired asset for book purposes, had the effect of reducing the Company's net deferred tax asset ("DTA") and eliminated the potential risk for the exclusion of the DTA related to the Freddie Mac stock from regulatory capital in future periods.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2012 totaled $73.2 million compared to $72.6 million for the previous quarter and $77.2 million for the 2011 fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2012, G&A expense totaled $300.1 million compared to $301.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. The fourth quarter G&A expense includes a $2.2 million settlement charge associated with previously announced executive retirements. The full year 2012 expense includes net charges totaling $5.6 million representing severance related expenses associated with cost control initiatives implemented in the 2012 first quarter, including the 2012 fourth quarter settlement charge, and a $1.2 million expense related to the early extinguishment of debt in the 2012 third quarter.
Repair and recovery costs as a result of Hurricane Sandy reflected in non-interest expense totaled $855,000. In addition, in support of the communities we serve, the Company contributed relief donations of $154,000 and waived banking fees of approximately $328,000 for customers impacted by the storm. From a credit standpoint, we have not currently experienced any notable increase in missed loan payments.
Impact from Hurricane Sandy
Total assets decreased $525.4 million from December 31, 2011 to $16.5 billion at December 31, 2012. The decline is primarily attributable to a decrease in the securities portfolio. The net decline in the loan portfolio, down $50.6 million year-over-year, reflects the changing mix in the loan composition, with multi-family loans increasing and residential loans decreasing as a percentage of the total loan portfolio.
Balance Sheet Summary
The residential (one-to-four family) loan portfolio decreased $528.2 million from September 30, 2012 and $850.3 million from December 31, 2011 to $9.7 billion at December 31, 2012. The decline was due to the pace of residential loan prepayments exceeding the pace of residential loan originations due to historic low interest rates for 30-year fixed rate conforming loans, thereby making the hybrid ARM product less attractive to borrowers. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2012, residential loan originations for portfolio totaled $220.4 million and $2.5 billion, respectively, compared to $1.1 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2011 periods. The loan-to-value ratio of the residential loan production for portfolio for the 2012 fourth quarter and full year averaged approximately 59% and 60%, respectively, at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $782,000 and $738,000, respectively. Residential loan prepayments for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $633.7 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, compared to $996.0 million and $3.3 billion, respectively, for the comparable 2011 periods. "We expect the level of residential loan prepayments to continue to remain elevated and residential ARM loan production to remain tepid as 30-year fixed rate mortgage interest rates are expected to remain at historic lows for some time," Mr. Redman noted.
The combined MF/CRE portfolios increased $203.4 million, or 7%, from September 30, 2012 and $827.0 million, or 35%, from December 31, 2011 to $3.2 billion at December 31, 2012, and represents 24% of the total loan portfolio. For the quarter and year ended December 31, 2012, MF/CRE loan originations totaled $383.4 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, compared to $202.9 million and $204.0 million, respectively, for the comparable 2011 periods. The $1.6 billion of MF/CRE loans originated during 2012 have loan to value ratios averaging approximately 53% at origination and balances averaging approximately $3.1 million with a weighted average coupon of 3.63%. Commenting on the loan volume, Mr. Redman noted, "I am very pleased that our 2012 MF/CRE loan production exceeded our expectations, which demonstrates the success achieved since re-entering this business in late 2011. We remain confident that our continued focus on MF/CRE lending will further enhance our franchise and benefit the net interest margin and future profitability." MF/CRE loan prepayments for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2012 totaled $150.6 million and $694.8 million, respectively, compared to $182.4 million and $684.9 million for the comparable 2011 periods.
The securities portfolio declined $242.4 million, or 11%, from September 30, 2012 and $438.6 million, or 18%, from December 31, 2011 and totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2012 representing 12% of total assets at December 31, 2012.
Deposits decreased $94.9 million from September 30, 2012 and $801.7 million from December 31, 2011 and totaled $10.4 billion at December 31, 2012. These declines are due to decreases of $363.9 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, in high cost CDs, offset by increases of $269.0 million and $757.0 million, respectively, in low cost core deposits. Core deposits, which totaled $6.5 billion, or 62% of total deposits, at December 31, 2012, had an average cost of 20 basis points for the 2012 fourth quarter. The growth in core deposits is a result of our efforts to reposition the mix of both assets and liabilities. Business core deposits for the year 2012 increased 12% and totaled $489.3 million at December 31, 2012. Mr. Redman, commenting on the growth in business banking, stated, "Our business banking expansion initiatives helped facilitate the growth in our core deposits and are generating new core relationships within the community and deepening our existing relationships."
Borrowings decreased $435.9 million from September 30, 2012 and increased $251.9 million from December 31, 2011 to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2012. During the full year 2012, we extended $700.0 million of borrowings with a weighted average rate of 1.05% and a weighted average term of 46 months, excluding the 5.00% Senior Notes issued in June 2012, the proceeds of which were used to redeem our 5.75% Senior Notes in September 2012. In addition, notwithstanding the decline in CDs, during the full year of 2012, we extended $672.2 million of CDs for terms of two years or more. These transactions were initiated in an effort to help limit our exposure to future increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2012, our one year interest rate sensitivity gap was positive 13.23%.
Stockholders' equity totaled $1.3 billion, or 7.84% of total assets, at December 31, 2012. Astoria Federal continues to be well-capitalized with leverage, tangible, total risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 9.24%, 9.24%, 16.49% and 15.23%, respectively, at December 31, 2012.
Non-performing loans ("NPLs"), including troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") of $32.8 million, totaled $315.1 million, or 1.91% of total assets, at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $7.1 million from the previous quarter and $17.8 million from December 31, 2011. As a result of the implementation of regulatory guidance, the Company has reflected $12.5 million of residential loans in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs, of which $5.7 million were newly included in NPLs, even though less than 90 days delinquent, as of year-end 2012. At December 31, 2012, residential NPLs totaled $291.1 million, MF/CRE NPLs totaled $17.5 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $6.5 million, compared to $294.7 million, $21.4 million and $6.1 million, respectively, at September 30, 2012. Of the $291.1 million of residential NPLs, $242.0 million, or 83%, represent residential loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
Asset Quality
The following table illustrates a two-year migration for loan delinquencies:
The table below details, as of December 31, 2012, the ten largest concentrations by state of residential loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states.
Included in the 2012 fourth quarter residential net loan charge-offs are $8.0 million of charge-offs on $50.5 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2012 fourth quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. "While the trend of lower NPLs is continuing, we expect NPL levels will remain somewhat elevated for some time, especially in those states requiring judicial foreclosure. It is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 83% of the residential NPLs to their adjusted fair value less estimated selling costs," Mr. Redman noted.
Commenting on the outlook for 2013, Mr. Redman stated, "With the yield curve remaining flat and interest rates expected to remain at historic lows for the near term, the operating environment for financial institutions remains challenging. We will, therefore, continue to concentrate on growing the MF/CRE loan portfolio and increasing low-cost core deposits, particularly through the expansion of our business banking platform in 2013. This will include the addition of seasoned business relationship managers to accelerate business deposit growth, coupled with the opening of several branches in select communities that offer increased opportunities to extend our business banking footprint. While these initiatives are expected to result in higher G&A expenses this year, we expect that they will further enhance the value of our franchise and improve future profitability. In addition, the positive effect of the balance sheet repositioning should help mitigate the negative impact of the low interest rate environment and allow us to maintain a net interest margin for 2013 at, or slightly higher than, the margin for the 2012 full year."

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may , jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified by written notice delivered to the indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; , , that if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, (ii) the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified party that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time after receipt by the indemnifying party of notice of the institution of such action, then, in each such case, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties and such indemnified party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to defend such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties at the expense of the indemnifying party. After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof and reasonable approval by such indemnified party of counsel appointed to defend such action, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other expenses, other than reasonable costs of investigation, subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof, unless (i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however, that in connection with such action the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate counsel (in addition to local counsel) in any one action or separate but substantially similar actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, designated by the Representatives in the case of Section 6(a) or the Company in the case of Section 6(b), representing the indemnified parties under such Section 6(a) or (b), as the case may be, who are parties to such action or actions) or (ii) the indemnifying party has authorized in writing the employment of counsel for the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party. After such notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party, the indemnifying party will not be liable for the costs and expenses of any settlement of such action effected by such indemnified party without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), unless such indemnifying party waived in writing its rights under this Section, in which case the indemnified party may effect such a settlement without such consent.

(d)          . No indemnifying party shall be liable under this Section for any settlement of any claim or action (or threatened claim or action) effected without its written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if a claim or action settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff with respect to any such claim or action, each indemnifying party jointly and severally agrees, subject to the exceptions and limitations set forth above, to indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified party from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (and legal and other expenses as set forth above) incurred by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement or compromise of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which the indemnified party is or could have been a party, or indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement (A) includes an unconditional written release of the indemnified party, in form and substance satisfactory to the indemnified party, from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any statement as to an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the indemnified party.

The relative benefits received by the Company and the Bank, on the one hand, and the Underwriters, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total proceeds from the Offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault of the parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company, on the one hand, or the Underwriters pursuant to Section 6(b) above, on the other hand, the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or alleged statement or omissions, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances.
Contribution
 
(f)          . The Company, the Bank and the Underwriters agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such contribution determined pursuant to Section 6(e) were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(e). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, an Underwriter shall not be obligated to make contributions hereunder that in the aggregate exceed the total discounts, commissions and other compensation received by the Underwriter under this Agreement, less the aggregate amount of any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of the untrue or alleged untrue statements or the omissions or alleged omissions to state a material fact. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters obligation to contribute hereunder shall be several in proportion to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint. For purposes of Section 6(e), each director, officer, employee and affiliate of each Underwriter, and each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as each Underwriter, and each director, officer, and employee of the Company, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company.

If, on the Delivery Date any Underwriter shall fail or refuse to purchase Depositary Shares which it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on such date and the number of Depositary Shares with respect to which such default occurs is more than one tenth of the number of Depositary Shares to be purchased on such date, and arrangements satisfactory to the non-defaulting Underwriters and the Company for the purchase of such Depositary Shares are not made within 36 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of the non-defaulting Underwriters or of the Company.

Astoria Financial Corporation First Quarter Earnings Per Common Share Increases 27% To $0.14
Quarterly Common Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share Declared
LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., April 17, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Astoria Financial Corporation (NYSE: AF) ("Astoria", or the "Company"), the holding company for Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Association ("Astoria Federal"), today reported net income of $13.9 million, or $0.14 diluted earnings per common share ("diluted EPS") for the quarter ended March 31, 2013, representing increases of 39% and 27%, respectively, from net income of $10.0 million, or $0.11 diluted EPS, for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. The quarter ended March 31, 2012 includes net charges totaling $3.4 million ($2.2 million, or $0.02 per share, after-tax), representing severance related expenses associated with cost control initiatives implemented in the 2012 first quarter.
First Quarter Financial Highlights
:
Loan Portfolio Shift Continues
Multifamily/commercial real estate ("MF/CRE") loan originations totaled $345.6 million.
MF/CRE loans continue to become a larger percentage of the loan portfolio and increased to 26% of total loans at March 31, 2013 from 24% at December 31, 2012.
MF/CRE loan pipeline increased 27% from December 31, 2012 to $706.7 million at March 31, 2013.
:
Greater Core Deposit Concentration
Lower cost core deposits continue to become a larger percentage of deposits and increased to 64% of total deposits at March 31, 2013 from 62% at December 31, 2012;
Business deposits increased 15% from December 31, 2012 to $563.1 million at March 31, 2013.
Total deposits increased to 73% of interest-bearing liabilities at March 31, 2013 from 70% at December 31, 2012.
Operating Expense Improvement:
Year over year decline in operating expenses achieved through cost control initiatives implemented in 2012 resulting in lower compensation and benefits expense, coupled with lower FDIC insurance premium and REO expenses.
Commenting on the first quarter results, Monte N. Redman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Astoria stated, "The double digit percentage increase in earnings in the 2013 first quarter compared to 2012 is largely due to a decline in operating expenses, primarily lower compensation and benefits expense. Our results also reflect the success from our strategy of repositioning the balance sheet as evidenced by significant increases in both our MF/CRE loan portfolio and core deposits, all of which should contribute to enhancing profitability and improving the value of our franchise."
The Board of Directors of the Company, at its April 17, 2013 meeting, declared a quarterly common cash dividend of $0.04 per share. The dividend is payable on June 1, 2013 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2013. This is the seventy-second consecutive quarterly common cash dividend declared by the Company.
Board Declares Quarterly Common Cash Dividend of $0.04 Per Share
Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 totaled $84.0 million compared to $87.4 million for the previous quarter and $88.2 million for the 2012 first quarter. The net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 was 2.19% compared to 2.21% for the previous quarter and 2.20%for the 2012 first quarter.
First Quarter Earnings Summary
Non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 totaled $18.3 million compared to $21.6 million for the previous quarter and $19.6 million for the 2012 first quarter. The linked quarter decrease is primarily due to the absence of gains on sales of securities, partially offset by increases in mortgage banking income, net. The year over year decrease is due, in addition to the above, to a decrease in customer service fees.
General and administrative ("G&A") expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 totaled $71.6millioncompared to $73.2 million for the previous quarter and $82.2 million for the 2012 first quarter. The decrease from the 2012 first quarter relates in large part to the impact of the cost control initiatives in 2012. The 2012 first quarter included net charges associated with cost control initiatives totaling $3.4 million, while periods subsequent to the 2012 first quarter have reflected lower operating costs as a result. In addition, the 2013 first quarter G&A also benefitted from a $1.6 million reduction in FDIC insurance premium expense as compared to the 2012 fourth quarter and a $1.0 million reduction as compared to the 2012 first quarter. The 2013 first quarter also included a reduction in compensation and benefits expense in the amount of $3.1 million, related to changes in certain compensatory policies which became effective January 1, 2013, as well as a one-time charge to occupancy, equipment and systems expense in the amount of $2.5 million, to conform to a straight-line basis the rental expense on operating leases for certain branch locations.
Total assets decreased $286.1 million from December 31, 2012 and totaled $16.2 billion at March 31, 2013. The decline is primarily attributable to a decrease in the loan portfolio partially offset by an increase in the securities portfolio. The loan portfolio decreased $312.2 million from December 31, 2012 and totaled $12.9 billion at March 31, 2013.
Balance Sheet Summary
The one-to-four family (residential) loan portfolio decreased $513.9 million from December 31, 2012 to $9.2 billion at March 31, 2013. The decline was due to the pace of residential loan prepayments exceeding the pace of residential loan originations due to historic low interest rates for 30-year fixed rate conforming loans, thereby making the hybrid ARM product less attractive to borrowers. For the quarter ended March 31, 2013, residential loan originations for portfolio totaled $233.5 million compared to $880.4 million for the comparable 2012 period. The loan-to-value ratio of the residential loan production for portfolio for the 2013 first quarter averaged approximately 61% at origination and the loan amount averaged approximately $756,000. Residential loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 totaled $638.5 million compared to $633.7 million for the 2012 fourth quarter and $766.7 million for the 2012 first quarter.
The combined MF/CRE portfolio increased $210.8 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2012 to $3.4 billion at March 31, 2013 and represents 26% of the total loan portfolio. For the quarter ended March 31, 2013, MF/CRE loan originations totaled $345.6 million compared to $344.3 million for the 2012 first quarter. The 2013 first quarter MF/CRE loans were originated with loan-to-value ratios averaging approximately 52%, balances averaging approximately $2.8 million and weighted average debt coverage ratios of 1.82%. MF/CRE loan prepayments for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 totaled $99.0 million compared to $192.3 million for the comparable 2012 period. At March 31, 2013, the MF/CRE pipeline totaled $706.7 million.
Deposits increased slightly from December 31, 2012 to $10.4 billion at March 31, 2013. Core deposits, which totaled $6.7 billion, or 64% of total deposits, at March 31, 2013, increased 3% and had a weighted average rate of 10 basis points at March 31, 2013. Certificates of deposit ("CDs"), which totaled $3.8 billion at March 31, 2013, or 36% of total deposits, declined 5%. At March 31, 2013, total deposits include business deposits of $563.1 million, an increase of 15% since year-end 2012. "The expansion of our business banking initiatives continues to facilitate the growth in our core deposits by generating new core relationships within the community and deepening our existing relationships," Mr. Redman noted.
Borrowings decreased $464.9 million, or 11%, from December 31, 2012 to $3.9 billion at March 31, 2013. The growth in core deposits and decrease in CDs and borrowings reflects our efforts to reposition the mix of liabilities. Total deposits increased to 73% of total interest-bearing liabilities at March 31, 2013, up from 70% at December 31, 2012.
Stockholders' equity increased $143.5 million to $1.4 billion, or 8.87% of total assets, at March 31, 2013. The increase is primarily attributed to the issuance of preferred stock in the 2013 first quarter, the net proceeds from which will be used toward the redemption, scheduled to occur on May 10, 2013, of the 9.75% capital securities issued by Astoria Capital Trust I, an affiliated Delaware trust resulting from the concurrent prepayment of our 9.75% junior subordinated debentures due November 1, 2029. The aggregate liquidation amount of the capital securities outstanding is $125 million which will be redeemed at 103.413% of the outstanding liquidation amount resulting in a prepayment penalty of $4.3 million in the 2013 second quarter. Astoria Federal continues to be well-capitalized with Tier 1 leverage, tangible, Total risk-based and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios of 9.42%, 9.42%, 16.74% and 15.48%, respectively, at March 31, 2013.
Non-performing loans ("NPLs") totaled $366.5 million, or 2.26% of total assets, at March 31, 2013. In the 2013 first quarter, in addition to Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans ("bankruptcy loans") reported as NPLs as of December 31, 2012, we also included loans discharged prior to 2012 in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing regardless of the delinquency status of the loan. As a result, NPLs reported at March 31, 2013 increased $51.4 million as compared to December 31, 2012,even as loans 90 days or more past due continued to decline. NPLs at March 31, 2013include $66.5 million of bankruptcy loans which are less than 90 days past due, including $54.3 million which were discharged prior to 2012. Of the total bankruptcy loans which are less than 90 days past due at March 31, 2013, $58.2 million are current, $6.5 million are 30-59 days past due and $1.8 million are 60-89 days past due. Such loans continue to generate interest income on a cash basis as payments are received.
Asset Quality
Residential NPLs totaled $343.5 million, of which $271.1 million are 90 days or more delinquent, MF/CRE NPLs totaled $16.5 million and consumer and other NPLs totaled $6.5 million at March 31, 2013 compared to $291.1 million, $17.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively, at December 31, 2012. Of the $271.1 million of residential NPLs delinquent 90 or more days, $238.5 million, or 88%, represent loans which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter were reviewed, and charged-off as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral at such time, less estimated selling costs.
The following table illustrates non-performing loan trends:
(1) Includes $66.5 million of loans that are current
The table below details, as of March 31, 2013, the ten largest concentrations by state of residential loans and the respective non-performing loan totals in those states.
(1) Includes 25 states and Washington, D.C. (2) Includes Florida with $168.6 million total loans, of which $18.9 million are non-performing loans. (3) Includes $72.4 million less than 90 days delinquent.
Selected Asset Quality Metrics
(
at or for the three months ended March 31, 2013)
(1) Includes home equity loans of $223.6 million. (2) Includes $64.1 million of net unamortized premiums and deferred loan costs. (3) Includes $72.4 million of loans less than 90 days past due. (4) Includes $238.5 million of NPLs reviewed, and charged-off as needed, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter. (5) Includes $79.2 million of loans less than 90 days past due.
Included in the 2013 first quarter residential net loan charge-offs are $5.3 million of charge-offs on $32.9 million of NPLs which, at 180 days delinquent and annually thereafter, were reviewed in the 2013 first quarter and charged-off, as needed, to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs. "We expect the level of NPLs 90 days or more delinquent will remain somewhat elevated for some time, especially in those states requiring judicial foreclosure. It is important to note that the loss potential remaining has been greatly reduced as a result of our having already reviewed, marked down, and charged-off as necessary, 88% of the residential NPLs 90 days or more delinquent, to their adjusted fair value less estimated selling costs," Mr. Redman noted.
Commenting on the future outlook, Mr. Redman stated, "Although the U.S. economy has begun showing signs of improvement, with interest rates expected to remain at historic lows for the near term, the operating environment continues to remain challenging. We will continue to concentrate on growing the MF/CRE loan portfolio and increasing low-cost core deposits. We are encouraged by the success we have achieved on both sides of the balance sheet, which is reflected in the loan closings and the significant increase in the MR/CRE pipeline as well as the growth in retail and business core deposits during the quarter. We look forward to this growth continuing in the future which should help in our efforts to maintain the net interest margin for 2013 slightly higher than the margin for 2012."
