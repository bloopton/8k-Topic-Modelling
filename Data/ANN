ANNTAYLOR NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES FISCAL YEAR 2002 SECOND QUARTER ---------------------------------------------------- EARNINGS, MOST PROFITABLE SECOND QUARTER TO DATE ------------------------------------------------ AND $50 MILLION SECURITIES BUY-BACK PROGRAM ------------------------------------------- NEW YORK, NEW YORK, August 14, 2002 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today net income for the second quarter ended August 3, 2002 of $18,202,000, or $0.39 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.5 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $6,399,000, or $0.15 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 43.9 million shares outstanding), in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2001 second quarter earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2002. There was no goodwill amortization recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", which the Company adopted in February 2002. Excluding the amortization of goodwill, second quarter fiscal 2001 net income and earnings per share on a diluted basis (restated for the effect of the 2002 stock split) would have been $8,961,000 or $0.20 per share on a diluted basis. As previously reported, total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2002 increased 10.6 percent to $343,143,000, from $310,292,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2002 decreased 0.2 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 12.9 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were up 0.3 percent for Ann Taylor stores, compared to a 17.2 percent decrease last year and down 1.5 percent for Ann Taylor Loft stores, compared to a 1.5 percent increase last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "The second quarter of 2002 was our most profitable second quarter to date and follows our most profitable first quarter in history. Gross margin on both full price and non-full price sales was strong throughout the season at both of our retail concepts, exceeding our expectations." Mr. Spainhour continued, "Based on stronger gross margin run rates in the first half of the year, last week we raised our third quarter earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.50 - $0.51 from a range of $0.45 - $0.46. Comparable sales for the third quarter are expected to be in the mid-single digits positive range, with August projected to be low-single digits negative to flat, September projected to be high mid-single digits positive, and October projected to be low-single digits positive. For the fourth quarter we remain comfortable with current earnings per share guidance in the range of $0.32 - $0.33. Comparable sales guidance for the fourth quarter is flat to last year. Full year earnings per share guidance is now in the range of $1.66 - $1.68." Inventory levels at the end of the second quarter were down approximately 25 percent on a per square foot basis, compared to the prior year. This comparison excludes inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing. Inventory levels for the second ================================================================================
2 ANNTAYLOR 2 quarter were lower than anticipated due to an increase in sales volume and the receipt of some fall product in August that was expected to be received in July. The Company expects inventory levels will be down 10 - 15 percent for the full year, compared to last year. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales increased to 52.8 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, compared to 49.0 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to higher margin rates achieved on both full price and non-full price sales at both divisions. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 as a percentage of net sales were flat to last year, at $150,425,000, or 43.8 percent of net sales, compared to $135,833,000, or 43.8 percent of net sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2001. Efficiencies in Ann Taylor store operations, lower internet costs and reduced marketing spend were offset by an increase in the provision for management performance bonus. Operating profit was 9.0 percent of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2002, compared to 5.2 percent (excluding the amortization of goodwill) in the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, the Company opened one new Ann Taylor store and three new Ann Taylor Loft stores. The total store count at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2002 was 555, comprised of 344 Ann Taylor stores, 183 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 28 Ann Taylor Factory stores. For the remaining fiscal year, the Company plans to open approximately five Ann Taylor stores and 23 Ann Taylor Loft stores bringing the fiscal 2002 year total to approximately 45 store openings. Total store square footage increased to 3,152,000 square feet as of August 3, 2002 from 2,838,000 square feet at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2001. Total long-term debt at August 3, 2002 was $119,951,000. At the end of the quarter, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under its $175,000,000 credit facility. For the full Spring season (fiscal year-to-date period ending August 3, 2002), the Company's net income was $39,124,000, or $0.84 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.4 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $17,343,000 or $0.40 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 47.2 million shares outstanding), for the same period last year. Excluding the amortization of goodwill, Spring 2001 net income and earnings per share on a diluted basis would have been $22,665,000 and $0.51, respectively. All fiscal 2001 Spring season earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2002. Spring 2002 net sales totaled $688,535,000, up 11.5 percent from $617,382,000 in Spring 2001, and comparable store sales decreased 0.1 percent in Spring 2002 compared to the same season last year. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the 2002 Spring season was 53.4 percent, compared to 50.5 percent in Spring 2001. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is ================================================================================
3 ANNTAYLOR 3 primarily due to higher margin rates achieved on both full price and non-full price sales at both divisions. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales were 43.8 percent in Spring 2002, compared to 44.0 percent in Spring 2001. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in Spring 2002 compared to Spring 2001 was primarily the result of efficiencies gained in Ann Taylor store operations and lower internet costs, partially offset by an increase in the provision for management performance bonus. The Company also announced today that its Board of Directors authorized a $50 million securities repurchase program. Under this program, purchases of shares of the Company's Common Stock and/or its Convertible Debentures due 2019 will be made from time to time, subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program is subject to compliance with the Company's credit agreement. Repurchased shares of Common Stock will become treasury shares and may be used for general corporate and other purposes and repurchased Convertible Debentures will be cancelled. Additionally, Ann Taylor Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J. Patrick Spainhour and Ann Taylor Chief Financial Officer James Smith signed and filed sworn statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) affirming the accuracy of SEC filings made by the Company in 2002. The documents for which Spainhour and Smith signed include Ann Taylor's 10-K for 2001, its 10-Q report for the first quarter of 2002, and its 2002 proxy statement. The Company also announced two executive appointments. Mark Eisen, who for 14 years headed his own, highly successful design business, will be joining the Company as Senior Vice President of Design for the Ann Taylor division, effective August 19, 2002. In his new position Mr. Eisen will report to Kim Roy, President of the Ann Taylor Division. The Company has continued to refine the design and merchandising staff at the Ann Taylor division.

Mr. Wagner brings with him 25 years of experience in information technology and management consulting and will be replacing retiring Wolly Morin.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ANNTAYLOR --------- NEWS RELEASE ------------ 142 West 57th St., New York, NY 10019 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES JANUARY SALES RESULTS ------------------------------------------ AND PROVIDES FISCAL YEAR 2003 GUIDANCE -------------------------------------- New York, New York, February 6, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation --------------------------------------- (NYSE: ANN) announced today that total net sales for the four week period ended February 1, 2003 decreased 3.7 percent to $81,903,000, from total net sales of $85,037,000 for the four week period ended February 2, 2002. Comparable store sales for the fiscal 2002 January period decreased 10.3 percent, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 14.6 percent for the same four week period last year. By division, comparable store sales were down 9.6 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 16.2 percent increase last year, and down 12.2 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to an 11.8 percent increase last year. For the fiscal quarter ended February 1, 2003, the Company's net sales totaled $352,213,000, down 5.2 percent from $371,386,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 decreased 12.3 percent, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. By division, comparable store sales were down 14.6 percent for Ann Taylor compared to flat last year and down 7.1 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to an 8.1 percent increase last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "We expect to report strong earnings performance with fourth quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis between $0.34 - $0.35 and full year earnings per share on a diluted basis between $1.71 - $1.72. Our ability to deliver these results despite a continuing soft retail environment reflects excellent controls on operations and costs, inventory management, and our success selling more product at or near full price." Mr. Spainhour continued, "Sales were affected by lower levels of traffic stemming from economic uncertainty for the entire month of January and extreme cold temperatures throughout the eastern and central regions of the country during the last two weeks of the month. Additionally, at Loft, we did not anniversary our end of season 50 percent off already reduced prices promotion in January. In spite of the difficult sales climate, we continued to experience gross margin improvement in January, with an approximate 600 basis point improvement over last year. In addition, we had a favorable gross margin pick-up at both divisions due to the results of our year-end physical inventory." ================================================================================
2 "While sales throughout the year were adversely affected by the sluggish economic environment and other factors, our ability to maximize the profitability of those sales on our bottom line contributed to our record 2002 earnings." "We expect to follow a similar formula in the coming year. At present, we believe that the consumer will take a very cautious approach to apparel purchases. Thus, we will concentrate on providing the customer with 'must have' fashion and seek to sell that merchandise at full price. We will continue to manage our expenses and our inventories carefully, and, as a result, hope to deliver another year of record results." Inventory levels at the end of January were down approximately 9 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. This follows an approximate 15 percent decrease in inventory levels on a per square foot basis at the end of fiscal December. Both comparisons exclude inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing. For fiscal year 2003 the Company expects inventory levels to be down in the mid-single digit negative range compared to last year. For the 2003 Spring season, the Company currently expects to achieve comparable store sales flat to last year, with first quarter comparable store sales projected to be in the low single digit negative to flat range and the second quarter comparable store sales projected to be in the low single digit positive range. For Fall 2003, the Company is projecting comparable store sales in the low single digit positive range. In 2003, the Company projects a modest improvement in gross margin and a slight decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the full year. For the first quarter the Company expects continued improvement in gross margin and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. The Company plans to open approximately 75 - 80 stores during fiscal 2003, comprised of approximately 10 - 15 Ann Taylor stores and approximately 60 - 65 Ann Taylor Loft stores. Total Company square footage increase for the fiscal 2003 year is projected to be approximately 12 percent. This represents an approximate 4 percent divisional square footage increase for Ann Taylor, and an approximate 28 percent divisional square footage increase for Ann Taylor Loft. In the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company plans to open 1 new Ann Taylor store and 12 new Ann Taylor Loft stores. During the second quarter of 2003, the Company plans to open 1 new Ann Taylor store and 7 new Ann Taylor Loft stores. Capital expenditures for 2003 are planned at $85 million, which includes costs for new store build outs, existing store renovations and warehouse and information system initiatives. Based on the above financial assumptions and planned store growth, the Company projects earnings per share on a diluted basis for the 2003 fiscal year to be between $1.90 and $2.00. The Company projects earnings per share on a diluted basis for the first and second quarters in the range of $0.45 - $0.47 and $0.44 - $0.46, respectively and in the range of $1.01 - $1.07 for the fall season. 2 ================================================================================
3 During the month of January, the Company opened 1 Ann Taylor Loft store and closed 1 Ann Taylor store and 1 Ann Taylor Factory store. The total store count at the end of fiscal year 2002 was 584, comprised of 350 Ann Taylor stores, 207 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total store square footage increased 8.1 percent over the same period last year. For the fiscal year 2002 ended February 1, 2003, the Company's net sales totaled $1,380,966,000, up 6.3 percent from $1,299,573,000 in fiscal 2001. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2002 decreased 3.9 percent from the same period last year. Comparable sales by division were down 5.3 percent for Ann Taylor, and down 1.0 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 584 stores in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also an Online Store at www.anntaylor.com. ----------------- FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ANNTAYLOR NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES 2002 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR EARNINGS --------------------------------------------------------------- NEW YORK, NEW YORK, March 11, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today net income for the fourth quarter ended February 1, 2003 of $16,123,000, or $0.35 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.3 million shares outstanding), compared to a net loss of $332,000, or $0.01 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 43.8 million shares outstanding), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2001 fourth quarter net income and earnings per share included $17,000,000 in pre-tax nonrecurring charges and $2,760,000 in goodwill amortization. Fiscal 2001 fourth quarter earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2002. As previously reported, total net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 totaled $352,213,000, down 5.2 percent from $371,386,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 decreased 12.3 percent, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 2.1 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were down 14.6 percent for Ann Taylor, compared to flat last year, and down 7.1 percent for Ann Taylor Loft, compared to an 8.1 percent increase last year. Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to a record 52.0 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, compared to 45.3 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Fourth quarter fiscal 2001 gross margin was affected by $4,100,000 in nonrecurring charges. Before considering these nonrecurring charges, gross margin, as a percentage of sales, was 46.4 percent. In addition, fourth quarter fiscal 2002 gross margin benefited from higher full price sales, higher margin rates achieved on both full price and non-full price sales at both divisions, as well as the results of a favorable year-end physical inventory. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, were $156,067,000, or 44.3 percent of net sales, compared to $162,821,000, or 43.8 percent of net sales for the same period last year. Fourth quarter fiscal 2001 selling, general and administrative expenses were impacted by $12,900,000 in pre-tax nonrecurring charges. Before considering these nonrecurring charges, selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, as a percentage of sales, were $149,894,000, or 40.4 percent. The remaining increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 as compared to the same period last year was primarily due to higher tenancy and store operation expenses, an increase in the provision for management performance bonus and severance costs associated with a former executive's employment contract with the Company. These increases were offset, in part, by savings associated with a change in the Company's vacation vesting policy, which became effective on January 1, 2003. ================================================================================
2 ANNTAYLOR 2 Operating profit was 7.7 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, compared to 0.7 percent of sales in the fourth quarter of last year. During the fourth fiscal quarter, the Company opened 1 new Ann Taylor store and 5 new Ann Taylor Loft stores, and closed 1 Ann Taylor store and 1 Ann Taylor Factory store. The total store count at the end of the fourth quarter was 584, comprised of 350 Ann Taylor stores, 207 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total store square footage increased 8.1 percent to 3,305,000 square feet as of February 1, 2003, from 3,057,000 square feet at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 were $45 million, which included the addition of 10 new Ann Taylor stores and 39 new Ann Taylor Loft stores. Total long-term debt at February 1, 2003 was $121,652,000. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its $175,000,000 credit facility at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. For the fiscal year-to-date period ended February 1, 2003, the Company's net income was $80,158,000, or $1.72 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.3 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $29,105,000, or $0.67 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 43.7 million shares outstanding) for the same period last year. Excluding the amortization of goodwill, fiscal 2001 year-to-date net income and earnings per share on a diluted basis would have been $39,750,000 and $0.90, respectively. Fiscal 2001 year-to-date earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2002. Fiscal year-to-date net sales totaled $1,380,966,000, up 6.3 percent from $1,299,573,000 as of February 2, 2002. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period decreased 3.9 percent, compared to a decrease of 6.1 percent for the same period last year. By division, fiscal 2002 comparable store sales decreased 5.3 percent for Ann Taylor and 1.0 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period ended February 1, 2003 was 54.1 percent, compared to 49.8 percent for the same period last year. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is the result of higher full price sales and higher margin rates achieved on both full price and non-full price sales at both divisions. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 44.3 percent, compared to 44.4 percent for the same period in fiscal 2001. In addition to the impact to fiscal 2001 selling, general and administrative costs of the fourth quarter nonrecurring charge discussed above, lower internet costs and reduced marketing spending were offset by an increase in the provision for management performance bonus and higher tenancy expenses. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "Despite the challenging retail environment in 2002, Ann Taylor succeeded in delivering the best earnings performance in our 48-year history. Our continued progress in aligning our product assortments to our core brand competencies and enhancing our client's overall shopping experience enabled us to sell more merchandise at full price. We also maintained a tight rein on inventories and implemented efficiency initiatives in our global sourcing function, which contributed to a 430 basis point improvement in gross margin. Improved gross margin and a continued focus on expense control resulted in operating margin of 9.8 percent, a 520 basis point increase over last year." ================================================================================
3 ANNTAYLOR 3 "The start of fiscal 2003 was negatively effected by severe weather conditions and prevailing economic uncertainty. Due to the effect that these external factors have had on our business we are lowering first quarter earnings guidance from the range of $0.45 - $0.47, to the range of $0.39 - $0.41. We currently expect to achieve first quarter comparable store sales in the low to mid single digit negative range compared to last year. We feel good about our product offering, however, due to the unknown factors stemming from the external environment, we believe that it is premature to provide updated second quarter, fall season and full year guidance." Mr. Spainhour continued, "Anticipating that any economic recovery will be slow and measured, we remain committed to further strengthening our business fundamentals in 2003 through continued disciplined expense and inventory management." The Company also announced today the election of Michael Trapp to the Board of Directors. Mr. Trapp was a partner at Ernst & Young from 1973 until his retirement in 2000, where he held various executive positions including Managing Partner for the Southeast area. Mr. Trapp has also joined the audit committee of the Board of Directors as the audit committee financial expert. Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 588 stores in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also an Online Store at www.anntaylor.com. ------------------ FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

EXHIBIT 99.1 [GRAPHIC OBJECT OMITTED] ANN TAYLOR NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, NY 10019 ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES MARCH SALES RESULTS Repurchased 380,000 Shares of Common Stock in March New York, New York, April 10, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today that total net sales for the five week period ended April 5, 2003 decreased 0.2 percent to $138,237,000, from total net sales of $138,531,000 for the five week period ended April 6, 2002. Comparable store sales for the period decreased 8.2 percent compared to a comparable store sales increase of 3.5 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal March 2003 were down 9.2 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 0.6 percent decrease last year and down 6.4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 17.1 percent increase last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "As anticipated, the retail environment in March remained challenging. Sales for the month were negatively affected by lower levels of traffic due to unseasonably cold weather in many markets during the first half of March and a sluggish macro environment resulting from geopolitical concerns. Additionally, we believe a late Easter had the effect of driving sales from March into April. We currently expect April comparable store sales to be in the low single digit negative to flat range. "In March, marketing efforts including magazine, direct mail, and in-store promotions and events drove our business," continued Spainhour. "Despite challenging shopping patterns and the Easter shift, we had some category successes worthy of mention. At Ann Taylor color and novelty were well received and the division enjoyed strong performance in its suits, knits, sweaters, outerwear and fashion accessory categories. Fashion, value and color drove our Loft client into the store. Suits, knits, wovens, casual separates, outerwear and fashion accessories were standout performers at LOFT." Total inventory levels at the end of March were down approximately 5 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. This comparison includes inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing. From a national perspective, the northeast, midatlantic and midwest performed stronger than the south and west regions of the country. Mr. Spainhour continued, "During March we repurchased 380,000 shares of common stock, using $6.9 million of our $50 million authorization under the securities repurchase program approved by our Board during the second quarter of 2002. Including the 300,000 shares we repurchase in February, we have repurchased a total of 680,000 shares of common stock, using $12.8 million this fiscal year." During the month, the Company opened 7 new Ann Taylor Loft stores, bringing the total store count at month end to 595, comprised of 350 Ann Taylor stores, 218 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total square footage at the end of fiscal March increased 8.9 percent over the same period last year. During the remainder of the first quarter, the Company plans to open one additional Ann Taylor store and 6 new Ann Taylor Loft stores. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company plans to open 2 new Ann Taylor Loft stores and one Ann Taylor Factory store. Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 595 stores in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also an Online Store at www.anntaylor.com as of April 5, 2003. o o o FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ANNTAYLOR --------- NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH ST. NEW YORK, NY 10019 ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES APRIL 2003 SALES RESULTS --------------------------------------------- New York, New York, May 8, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) - -------------------------------- announced today that total net sales for the four week period ended May 3, 2003 increased 6.1 percent to $132,494,000 over total net sales of $124,865,000 for the four week period ended May 4, 2002. Comparable store sales for the period decreased 3.2 percent compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 2.7 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal April 2003 were down 6.8 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 4.4 percent decrease last year, and up 5.7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 0.5 percent increase last year. Comparable store sales for the combined March and April period decreased 5.8 percent compared to a comparable store sales increase of 0.3 percent for the same nine-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for combined fiscal March and April were down 8.1 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a decrease of 2.5 percent last year, and down 0.7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to an 8.7 percent increase last year. For the first quarter and fiscal year-to-date period ending May 3, 2003, total net sales were $352,017,000, up 1.9 percent from $345,392,000 for the same period last year. Comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were down 6.5 percent, compared to an increase of 0.1 percent for the first quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the first quarter were down 8.1 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 2.1 percent decrease last year, and down 2.8 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 5.9 percent increase last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "We were extremely pleased with our client's response to Ann Taylor Loft's product offering during April. The positive sales trend built throughout the last six weeks of the quarter and we are excited about Loft's momentum going into May. The combination of great fashion and color starting mid-March into April set us apart. Stripe pants, all woven shirts, especially voile shirts, and all categories of linen were standouts. "At Ann Taylor our assortment lacked color, fashion and sophistication, which led to disappointing April and first quarter sales results. The strength of our margin, resulting from the continuation of tight inventory management and strong IMU, helped offset our fashion misses." Mr. Spainhour continued, "At Ann Taylor we expect to continue to experience fashion misses in the second quarter, however, fashion elements improve for the fall season. We are currently working on fall marketing to support a more updated and sophisticated style than in seasons past. We look forward to improved fashion, coupled with more powerful marketing and stronger visual presentations to drive traffic and sales volume for the fall season." ================================================================================
2 For the first quarter the Company expects to report earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.39, which is in the low range of Company guidance of $0.39 - $0.41. The Company plans to provide second quarter and full year earnings guidance in the first quarter earnings release and live conference call scheduled for May 14th, after market close. Inventory levels at the end of April were up approximately 5 percent on a per square foot basis, compared to the prior year. This comparison includes inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing. From a regional perspective, northeast performance was the weakest primarily due to cooler temperatures compared to the same period last year. During the month, the Company opened one new Ann Taylor store and six new Ann Taylor Loft stores. This brings the total store count at month end to 602, comprised of 351 Ann Taylor stores, 224 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total square footage at the end of fiscal April increased 8.7 percent over last year. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company plans to open two new Ann Taylor Loft stores, one new Ann Taylor Factory store, and close one Ann Taylor store. Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 602 stores in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also an Online Store at www.anntaylor.com. ----------------- For more information, please call (866) 214-2661 to listen to Ann Taylor Stores Corporations monthly sales recording.

Exhibit 99.1 ANNTAYLOR NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019 ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES FISCAL YEAR 2003 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS ------------------------------------------------------------ NEW YORK, NEW YORK, May 14, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today net income for the first quarter ended May 3, 2003 of $17,928,000, or $0.39 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 47.9 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $20,922,000, or $0.45 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.3 million shares outstanding), in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2002 first quarter earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated to reflect the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2002. As previously reported, total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 totaled $352,017,000, up 1.9 percent from $345,392,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. By division, net sales were $201,326,000 for Ann Taylor and $119,923,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 decreased 6.5 percent, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 0.1 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were down 8.1 percent for Ann Taylor, compared to a 2.1 percent decrease last year, and down 2.8 percent for Ann Taylor Loft, compared to a 5.9 percent increase last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "Sales trends at Ann Taylor Loft significantly improved during the last six weeks of the quarter as a result of our great fashion at a value. Based on the sales momentum going into May and our product investment, we feel positive about second quarter business at Ann Taylor Loft. At Ann Taylor, we continue to struggle with our offering which lacks the modern sophistication our client demands. We expect that the fashion misses experienced during the first quarter will continue for the remainder of the spring season. However, for the fall season, we look forward to improved fashion elements that will help elevate our sales trends." Mr. Spainhour continued, "Factoring in continued success at Ann Taylor Loft and product inconsistencies at Ann Taylor, we currently project earnings per share on a diluted basis for the second quarter in the range of $0.35 - $0.37, in the range of $0.98 - $1.04 for the fall season, and in the range of $1.72 - $1.80 for the 2003 fiscal year. Additionally, we expect second quarter, and May, June and July, total company comparable store sales to be in the low single-digit negative to flat range. For the quarter, comparable store sales are expected to be down low single digit negative for Ann Taylor and up low single digit positive for Ann Taylor Loft." Total inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were up 5 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. Inventory levels at both concepts were up approximately the same amount. All comparisons include inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing. The Company expects inventory levels on a per square foot basis to be flat to low single-digit positive for the full year, compared to last year. ================================================================================
2 ANNTAYLOR 2 Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased slightly to 53.7 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to 54 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2003, were $158,618,000, or 45.1 percent of net sales, compared to $151,081,000, or 43.7 percent of net sales for the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily the result of an overall deleveraging of expenses due to negative comparable store sales, and higher tenancy and new store operations expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for management performance bonus. Additionally, 2002 was favorably impacted by a gain on the sale of the Ann Taylor proprietary credit card. Operating profit was 8.6 percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to 10.3 percent of net sales in the first quarter of last year. During the first fiscal quarter, the Company opened one new Ann Taylor store and 17 new Ann Taylor Loft stores. The total store count at the end of the first quarter was 602, comprised of 351 Ann Taylor stores, 224 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total store square footage increased 8.7 percent to 3,400,000 square feet as of May 3, 2003, from 3,128,000 square feet at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2002. Total square footage, by division, as of the end of the first quarter was 1,815,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 1,336,000 square feet for Ann Taylor Loft. Total long-term debt at May 3, 2003 was $122,515,000. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its $175,000,000 credit facility at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 602 stores in 42 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also an Online Store at www.anntaylor.com. ----------------- FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS Certain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements, made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ANNTAYLOR NEWSRELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019 ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES JULY 2003 SALES RESULTS -------------------------------------------- New York, New York, August 7, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) - ---------------------------------- announced today total net sales for the four week period ended August 2, 2003 increased 15.7 percent to $116,451,000 over total net sales of $100,623,000 for the four week period ended August 3, 2002. By division, net sales were $65,020,000 for Ann Taylor and $41,687,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the period increased 7.6 percent compared to a comparable store sales increase of 7.4 percent for the same four week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal July 2003 were up 8.6 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 9.0 percent increase last year, and up 5.0 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 4.8 percent increase last year. For the second quarter of fiscal 2003, total net sales were $390,207,000, up 13.7 percent from $343,143,000 for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the second quarter were $216,038,000 for Ann Taylor and $140,008,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 were up 5.3 percent, compared to a decrease of 0.2 percent for the second quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the second quarter were up 4.9 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 0.3 percent increase last year, and up 5.7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 1.5 percent decrease last year. Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "We were pleased with the success of our end of season clearance at both our Ann Taylor and Ann Taylor Loft divisions. The strong performance of our summer clearance allowed us to enter August in a clean inventory position." Mr. Spainhour continued, "Due to higher than expected sales and related margin, we are raising our second quarter earnings per share guidance to approximately $0.44 - $0.45 from the range of $0.39 - $0.41." Total inventory levels at the end of July, including inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing, were down approximately 8 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year, consistent across both divisions. This decrease is primarily due to lower in-transit inventory levels compared to last year. The company continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $0.98 - $1.04 for the fall season and will provide third and fourth quarter guidance at the time of its second quarter earnings announcement scheduled for August 13th. Geographically, sales results were weakest in the Northeast region of the country. These results were consistent across both divisions. ================================================================================

EXHIBIT 99.1 ANNTAYLOR --------- NEWS RELEASE ------------ ANNTAYLOR ANNOUNCES RECORD FISCAL YEAR 2003 SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS ------------------------------------------------------------------- NEW YORK, NEW YORK, August 13, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today net income for the second quarter ended August 2, 2003 of $21,177,000, or $0.45 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.3 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $18,202,000, or $0.39 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.5 million shares outstanding), in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. As previously reported, total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 were $390,207,000, up 13.7 percent from $343,143,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. By division, net sales were $216,038,000 for Ann Taylor and $140,008,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2003 increased 5.3 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 0.2 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were up 4.9 percent for Ann Taylor, compared to a 0.3 percent increase last year, and up 5.7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft, compared to a 1.5 percent decrease last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "Despite our slow start in the first quarter we managed to achieve record second quarter earnings of $0.45 per share, which combined with our first quarter earnings, equaled last year's record spring earnings performance. The second quarter was propelled by positive comparable store sales each month for both divisions other than a slight negative comparable store sales percentage in June for Ann Taylor. "Ann Taylor's positive comparable store sales for the quarter were driven by strategically managed promotions that helped optimize selling of product that continued to border on being too safe, lacking color and sophistication. Ann Taylor Loft's success continued to be a full-price story fueled by momentum coming out of March driven by fashion, color, femininity and novelty product to provide our clients with unequaled value." Mr. Spainhour continued, "We remain comfortable with current earnings per share guidance for the fall season in the range of $0.98 - $1.04, and project third and fourth quarter earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $0.57 - $0.61 and $0.41 - $0.43, respectively. Full year earnings per share guidance is now in the range of $1.82 - $1.88. Additionally, we expect August, September and October, comparable store sales to be in the range of positive 3 to positive 5 percent for both divisions. For the fourth quarter we expected comparable store sales to be in the range of positive 5 to positive 7 percent for both divisions." Total inventory levels at the end of the second quarter, including inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing, were down approximately 8 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year, consistent across both divisions. This decrease is primarily due to lower in-transit inventory levels compared to last year. The Company expects inventory levels on a per square foot basis to be flat to last year for the third and fourth quarter. ================================================================================
2\ ANNTAYLOR Page 2 of 5 Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 51.9 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to 52.8 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2002. This decrease is primarily due to the combined effect of lower full price sales at Ann Taylor and lower margin rates achieved on non-full price sales at both divisions. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, were $166,660,000, or 42.7 percent of net sales, compared to $150,425,000, or 43.8 percent of net sales for the same period last year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales are primarily due to increased leverage on fixed expenses as a result of higher comparable store sales. Operating profit was up slightly to 9.2 percent of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to 9.0 percent of net sales in the second quarter of last year. During the second quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company increased its effective income tax rate from 39 percent to 40 percent to reflect higher state taxes. The Company opened two new Ann Taylor Loft stores, one Ann Taylor Factory store and closed one existing Ann Taylor store and one Ann Taylor Factory store during the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The total store count at the end of the second quarter was 603, comprised of 350 Ann Taylor stores, 226 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. During the fall season, the Company plans to open approximately 8 Ann Taylor stores and 44 Ann Taylor Loft stores, bringing the fiscal 2003 year total to approximately 73 store openings. The Company's total capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 is now projected at $80 million. Total store square footage increased 8.1 percent to 3,408,000 square feet as of August 2, 2003, from 3,152,000 square feet at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2002. Total square footage, by division, as of the end of the second quarter was 1,815,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 1,347,000 square feet for Ann Taylor Loft. Total long-term debt at August 2, 2003 was $123,386,000. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its $175,000,000 credit facility at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2003. For the full Spring season (fiscal year-to-date period ending August 2, 2003), the Company's net income was $39,105,000, or $0.84 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.1 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $39,124,000 or $0.84 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.4 million shares outstanding), for the same period last year. ================================================================================
3 ANNTAYLOR Page 3 of 5 Spring 2003 net sales totaled $742,224,000, up 7.8 percent from $688,535,000 in spring 2002. By division, net sales for the spring season were $417,364,000 for Ann Taylor and $259,931,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the spring season decreased 0.5 percent. Comparable store sales by division were down 1.8 percent for Ann Taylor and up 1.7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the spring 2003 season was 52.8 percent, compared to 53.4 percent in spring 2002.

EXHIBIT 99.1 AnnTaylor News Release 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019 ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES AUGUST 2003 SALES RESULTS ---------------------------------------------- New York, New York, September 4, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: - -------------------------------------- ANN) announced today total net sales for the four-week period ended August 30, 2003 increased 18.0 percent to $104,596,000 over total net sales of $88,615,000 for the four- week period ended August 31, 2002. By division, net sales were $52,686,000 for Ann Taylor and $41,395,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the period increased 8.2 percent compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 7.6 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal August 2003 were up 6.6 percent for Ann Taylor compared to an 8.7 percent decrease last year, and up 7.1 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 5.4 percent decrease last year. Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "For August we achieved better than expected comparable store sales results. We continue to be pleased with the overall performance of the Ann Taylor Loft business. Promotions helped drive strong comparable sales results at both divisions, especially at Ann Taylor, and put us in a good inventory position as we enter September. At our factory division, our on-going clearance strategy coupled with well-received factory direct product drove strong performance. We are pleased about our momentum going into September and look forward to the fall season." Total inventory levels at the end of August, including inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing, were down approximately 8 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 11 percent for Ann Taylor and 3 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The decrease in inventory levels compared to last year is attributable to better product sell-through in August combined with lower in-transit inventory levels. The company continues to expect earnings per share for the third and fourth quarter in the range of $0.57 - $0.61 and $0.41 - $0.43, respectively. During the month, the Company opened one new Ann Taylor store and seven new Ann Taylor Loft stores. The total store count at fiscal month end was 611, comprised of 351 Ann Taylor stores, 233 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total square footage at the end of fiscal August increased 8.5 percent over last year. For the fiscal year-to-date period ended August 30, 2003, the Company's net sales totaled $846,820,000, up 9.0 percent from $777,150,000 for the same period in fiscal 2002. By division, net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were $470,050,000 for Ann Taylor and $301,326,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable stores sales for the fiscal year-to-date period increased 0.5 percent over the same period last year.

Exhibit 99.1 ANNTAYLOR NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019 ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES SEPTEMBER 2003 SALES RESULTS ------------------------------------------------- New York, New York, October 9, 2003 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: - ------------------------------------- ANN) announced today total net sales for the five week period ended October 4, 2003 increased 17.2 percent to $160,484,000 over total net sales of $136,945,000 for the five week period ended October 5, 2002. By division, net sales were $83,580,000 for Ann Taylor and $64,488,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the period increased 6.9 percent compared to a comparable store sales increase of 2.3 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal September 2003 were up 0.8 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 0.4 percent increase last year, and up 17.1 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 4.9 percent increase last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "We are excited about our September performance at Ann Taylor Stores Corporation. Both divisions posted positive comparable store sales gains over last year's positive comparable store sales results. September's performance has set a good foundation for the rest of the season." Mr. Spainhour continued, "We are enthusiastic about our Ann Taylor Loft performance for September. We surpassed our expectations with outstanding full-price performance in our casual and relaxed separates, tops, accessories and petites. Fashion, color, novelty at a great value drove sales and margin across all product categories. "At Ann Taylor we were pleased with our sales performance in our pants, woven shirts, and outerwear categories, however, the overall assortment continued to lack the proper balance of color and novelty. We are encouraged by the sales pick-up experienced during the fifth week of the month providing us with sales momentum as we head into October." Total inventory levels at the end of September, including inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing, were down approximately 8 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 9 percent for Ann Taylor and 3 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The decrease in inventory levels compared to last year is attributable to better product sell-through. The company continues to expect earnings per share for the third and fourth quarter in the range of $0.57 - $0.61 and $0.41 - $0.43, respectively. During the month, the Company opened 4 new Ann Taylor stores and 13 new Ann Taylor Loft stores. The total store count at month end was 628, comprised of ================================================================================ 355 Ann Taylor stores, 246 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total store square footage at the end of the month increased 9.6 percent over the year before. For the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 4, 2003, the Company's net sales totaled $1,007,304,000, up 10.2 percent from $914,095,000 for the same period in fiscal 2002. By division, net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were $553,630,000 for Ann Taylor and $365,814,000 for Ann Taylor Loft.

Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "At Ann Taylor Loft, we continue to be excited with the outstanding sales performance seen across all product categories. For October, tops, suits, separates, shoes and fashion accessories all registered double-digit comparable store sales increases. We expect our positive sales momentum to continue throughout the Holiday season. "Although Ann Taylor sales were somewhat less than expected, comparable store sales momentum built at the end of the month as more color and novelty arrived for the Holidays. We continue to expect to achieve positive fourth quarter sales results for the division." Mr. Spainhour continued, "Due to the strength of our October gross margin, we are raising third quarter earnings guidance to the range of $0.62 - $0.63 from the range of $0.57 - $0.61 per share. We plan to release third quarter earnings results on November 12th, after the market close. For the fourth quarter we continue to expect earnings per share in the range of $0.41 - $0.43 and comparable store sales of 5 - 7 percent for Ann Taylor and Ann Taylor Loft." Total inventory levels at the end of October, including inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing, were flat on a per square foot basis compared to last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were up approximately 7 percent at Ann Taylor and down approximately 4 percent at Ann Taylor Loft. Inventory levels at Ann Taylor were up due to higher in-transit inventory, while at Ann Taylor Loft, better product sell-through was responsible for the lower inventory levels. ================================================================================

The total store count at fiscal month end was 639, comprised of 355 Ann Taylor stores, 257 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores.

4 EXHIBIT INDEX ------------- Exhibit No. Description - ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------------- 99.1 Press Release issued by AnnTaylor Stores Corporation on November 12, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1 ANNTAYLOR NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019 ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES RECORD FISCAL YEAR 2003 -------------------------------------------- THIRD QUARTER NET INCOME AND EARNINGS ------------------------------------- NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 12, 2003 - Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today record net income for the third quarter ended November 1, 2003 of $30,305,000, or $0.63 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 49.3 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $24,911,000, or $0.53 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.4 million shares outstanding), in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. As previously reported, total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 increased 16.6 percent to $396,807,000, from $340,218,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. By division, net sales were $207,077,000 for Ann Taylor and $157,023,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 increased 6.2 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 1.1 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were up 1.9 percent for Ann Taylor, compared to a 2.9 percent decrease last year, and up 13.4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft, compared to a 1.7 percent increase last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "Ann Taylor Loft's outstanding third quarter performance is a full-price story fueled by momentum coming out of the second quarter. Loft's excellent performance was driven by exciting fashion, great color, and novelty product across all categories. At Ann Taylor, our positive third quarter comparable store sales results were driven by fall selling in our separates, woven tops, and outerwear categories. We anticipate that our holiday product and marketing initiatives will fuel positive fourth quarter sales results at both divisions." Mr. Spainhour continued, "For the fourth quarter we remain comfortable with current earnings per share guidance in the range of $0.41 - $0.43. We expect November, December and January, comparable store sales to be in the range of positive 5 to positive 7 percent for both divisions." Total inventory levels at the end of the third quarter, including inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing, were flat on a per square foot basis compared to last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were up approximately 7 percent at Ann Taylor and down approximately 4 percent at Ann Taylor Loft. Inventory levels at Ann Taylor were up due to higher in-transit inventory, while at Ann Taylor Loft, better product sell-through was responsible for the lower inventory levels. The Company continues to expect total inventory levels on a per square foot basis to be flat to last year for the remainder of the fiscal year. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2003 was flat to last year at 57.7 percent. ================================================================================

The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was due to increased leverage on tenancy and other fixed expenses resulting from positive comparable store sales.

If any Borrowing would exceed Availability, the Lenders may refuse to make or may otherwise restrict the making of Revolving Loans as the Lenders determine until such excess has been eliminated, subject to the Agent's authority, in its sole discretion, to make Agent Advances pursuant to the terms of Section 1.2(i). If there occurs any change in how (i) trade-payables, inventory purchases or other obligations (other than the Obligations hereunder) of the Borrowers are incurred or (ii) any Borrower's business is conducted that, in either case, results in any material increase in trade-payables, inventory purchases or other obligations (other than the Obligations hereunder) of any Borrower other than ATI, the Agent may require the Borrowers to, and the Borrowers agree to, amend this Agreement to reflect a multiple borrowing base structure for the Credit Extensions provided hereunder. (b) Procedure for Borrowing. (i) Each Borrowing shall be made upon a Borrower's irrevocable written notice delivered to the Agent in the form of a notice of borrowing ("Notice of Borrowing"), which must be received by the Agent prior to (i) 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) three Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date, in the case of LIBOR Loans and (ii) 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the requested Funding Date, in the case of Base Rate Loans, specifying: (A) the amount of the Borrowing, which in the case of a LIBOR Loan must equal or exceed $1,000,000 (and increments of $1,000,000 in excess of such amount); (B) the requested Funding Date, which must be a Business Day; (C) whether the Revolving Loans requested are to be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans (and if not specified, it shall be deemed a request for a Base Rate Loan); and (D) the duration of the Interest Period for LIBOR Loans (and if not specified, it shall be deemed a request for an Interest Period of one month); provided, however, that with respect to the Borrowing to be made on the Effective Date, such Borrowings will consist of Base Rate Loans only. (ii) In lieu of delivering a Notice of Borrowing, any Borrower may give the Agent telephonic notice of such request for advances to the Designated Account on or before the deadline set forth above. The Agent at all times shall be entitled to rely on such telephonic notice in making such Revolving Loans, regardless of whether any written confirmation is received. (c) Reliance upon Authority. Prior to the Effective Date, each Borrower shall deliver to the Agent, a notice setting forth the account of such Borrower ("Designated Account") to which the Agent is authorized to transfer the proceeds of the Revolving Loans requested hereunder. Any Borrower may designate a replacement account from time to time by written notice from a Responsible Officer. All such Designated Accounts must be reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. The Agent is entitled to rely conclusively on any person's request for Revolving Loans on behalf of such Borrower, so long as the proceeds thereof are to be transferred to the Designated Account. The Agent has no duty to verify the identity of any individual representing himself or herself as a person authorized by such Borrower to make such requests on its behalf. (d) No Liability. The Agent shall not incur any liability to any Borrower as a result of acting upon any notice referred to in Sections 1.2(b) and (c), which the Agent believes in good faith to have been given by an officer or other person duly authorized by such Borrower to request Revolving Loans on its behalf. The crediting of Revolving Loans to the Designated Account conclusively establishes the obligation of such Borrower to repay such Revolving Loans as provided herein. (e) Notice Irrevocable. Any Notice of Borrowing (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) made pursuant to Section 1.2(b) shall be irrevocable. The applicable Borrower shall be bound to borrow the funds requested therein in accordance therewith. (f) Agent's Election. Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof), the Agent shall elect to have the terms of Section 1.2(g) or the terms of Section 1.2(h) apply to such requested Borrowing. If the Bank declines in its sole discretion to make a Non-Ratable Loan pursuant to Section 1.2(h), the terms of Section 1.2(g) shall apply to the requested Borrowing. (g) Making of Revolving Loans. If Agent elects to have the terms of this Section 1.2(g) apply to a requested Borrowing, then promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing or telephonic notice in lieu thereof, the Agent shall notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone or e-mail of the requested Borrowing. Each Lender shall transfer its Pro Rata Share of the requested Borrowing available to the Agent in immediately available funds, to the account from time to time designated by Agent, not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the applicable Funding Date. After the Agent's receipt of all proceeds of such Revolving Loans, the Agent shall make the proceeds of such Revolving Loans available to the applicable Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by transferring same day funds to the Designated Account; provided, however, that the amount of Revolving Loans so made on any date shall not exceed the Availability on such date. (h) Making of Non-Ratable Loans. (i) If Agent elects, with the consent of the Bank, to have the terms of this Section 1.2(h) apply to a requested Borrowing, the Bank shall make a Revolving Loan in the amount of that Borrowing available to the applicable Borrower on the applicable Funding Date by transferring same day funds to such Borrower's Designated Account. Each Revolving Loan made solely by the Bank pursuant to this Section is herein referred to as a "Non-Ratable Loan", and such Revolving Loans are collectively referred to as the "Non-Ratable Loans." Each Non-Ratable Loan shall be subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to other Revolving Loans except that all payments thereon shall be payable to the Bank solely for its own account. The aggregate amount of Non-Ratable Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed $20,000,000. The Agent shall not request the Bank to make any Non-Ratable Loan if (A) the Agent has received written notice from any Borrower or any Lender that one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 8 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing, or (B) the requested Borrowing would exceed Availability on that Funding Date. (ii) The Non-Ratable Loans shall be secured by the Agent's Liens in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Base Rate Loans and Obligations hereunder. (i) Agent Advances. (i) Subject to the limitations set forth below, the Agent is authorized by the Borrowers and the Lenders, from time to time in the Agent's sole discretion after notice to and consultation with ATI, (A) after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default, or (B) at any time that any of the other conditions precedent set forth in Article 8 have not been satisfied, to make Base Rate Loans to one or more of the Borrowers on behalf of the Lenders which the Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or desirable (1) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, (2) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of, repayment of the Loans and other Obligations (including to provide cash collateral for outstanding Letters of Credit to the extent not otherwise funded by the Borrowers in accordance with Section 1.4(b) or (g)), or (3) to pay any other amount chargeable to any Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including costs, fees and expenses as described in Section 14.7 (any of such advances are herein referred to as "Agent Advances"); provided, that (A) at no time shall the aggregate amount of Agent Advances exceed 10% of the Borrowing Base on the date any Agent Advance is made, (B) at no time shall the aggregate amount of Agent Advances plus Aggregate Outstandings exceed the Total Facility Amount, and (C) the Required Lenders may at any time revoke the Agent's authorization to make Agent Advances. Any such revocation must be in writing and shall become effective prospectively upon the Agent's receipt thereof. (ii) As of the date of any Agent Advance made hereunder, the Agent shall have made arrangements with the Borrowers intended to eliminate or repay such Agent Advance within a reasonable time thereafter but in no event later than sixty (60) days following the date such Agent Advance is made. (iii) The Agent Advances shall be secured by the Agent's Liens in and to the Collateral and shall constitute Base Rate Loans and Obligations hereunder. 1.3 [Intentionally omitted.] 1.4 Letters of Credit. (a) Agreement to Issue or Cause To Issue. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Issuing Bank Agreement, upon request of any Borrower a Letter of Credit Issuer will issue for the account of any Borrower one or more Letters of Credit. (b) Amounts; Outside Expiration Date; Automatic Renewal. No Letter of Credit Issuer shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit at any time if: (i) the maximum face amount of the requested Letter of Credit is greater than the Unused Letter of Credit Subfacility at such time; (ii) the maximum undrawn amount of the requested Letter of Credit and all commissions, fees, and charges due from such Borrower in connection with the opening thereof would exceed Availability at such time; or (iii) such Letter of Credit has an expiration date less than four (4) Business Days prior to the Stated Termination Date or more than 12 months from the date of issuance for standby letters of credit and 180 days (subject to extension for a maximum period of sixty (60) days) for documentary letters of credit. If Letter of Credit Outstandings at any time exceed the lesser of the Borrowing Base or the Letter of Credit Subfacility, the Borrowers shall immediately provide cash collateral to the Agent in the amount of such excess to be held by the Agent until such time that no such excess amount exists. The Letter of Credit Issuers and the Lenders agree that, while a Standby Letter of Credit is outstanding and prior to the Termination Date, at the option of the applicable Borrower and upon the written request of the applicable Borrower received by the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer at least five (5) days (or such shorter time as such Letter of Credit Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of notification of renewal, such Letter of Credit Issuer shall be entitled to authorize the automatic renewal of any Standby Letter of Credit issued by it so long as, immediately after the renewal thereof, the aggregate amount of Letter of Credit Outstandings does not exceed the Letter of Credit Subfacility and Aggregate Outstandings do not exceed the lesser of the Total Facility Amount or the Borrowing Base. Each such request for renewal of a Letter of Credit shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer (i) the Letter of Credit to be renewed, (ii) the proposed date of notification of renewal of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the revised expiry date of the Letter of Credit, and (iv) such other matters as such Letter of Credit Issuer may require. No Letter of Credit Issuer shall so renew any Letter of Credit if (A) such Letter of Credit Issuer has actual knowledge that it would have no obligation at such time to issue or amend a Letter of Credit under the terms of Section 1.4(b) or (c) or Section 8.2, or (B) the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed renewal of the Letter of Credit. (c) Other Conditions. In addition to conditions precedent contained in Article 8, the obligation of the Agent to cause to be issued or of the Letter of Credit Issuers to issue any Letter of Credit is subject to the following conditions precedent having been satisfied in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Letter of Credit Issuers and the Agent: (i) The applicable Borrower shall have delivered to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer, at such times and in such manner as such Letter of Credit Issuer may prescribe, an application in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Letter of Credit Issuer and reasonably satisfactory to the Agent for the issuance of the Letter of Credit and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the terms thereof, and the form, terms and purpose of the proposed Letter of Credit shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and such Letter of Credit Issuer; and (ii) As of the date of issuance, no order of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain money center banks generally from issuing letters of credit of the type and in the amount of the proposed Letter of Credit, and no law, rule or regulation applicable to money center banks generally and no request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over money center banks generally shall prohibit, or request that the proposed Letter of Credit Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the issuance of such Letters of Credit. (d) Issuance of Letters of Credit. (i) Request for Issuance. The Borrower for whose account the Letter of Credit is to be issued must notify the Agent and the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer of a requested Letter of Credit on the proposed issuance date. Such notice shall be irrevocable and must specify the original face amount of the Letter of Credit requested, the Business Day of issuance of such requested Letter of Credit, whether such Letter of Credit may be drawn in a single or in partial draws, the Business Day on which the requested Letter of Credit is to expire, the purpose for which such Letter of Credit is to be issued, and the beneficiary of the requested Letter of Credit. In the case of Standby Letters of Credit, the full text of any certificate to be presented by the beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder shall be delivered to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer on the date of such request. Such notice shall comply with any additional requirements as are set forth in the relevant Issuing Bank Agreement or as the relevant Letter of Credit Issuer may require. Such Borrower shall attach to such notice the proposed form of the Letter of Credit . (ii) Responsibilities of the Borrowers; Issuance. As of the requested issuance date of the Letter of Credit, the requesting Borrower shall determine the amount of the Unused Letter of Credit Subfacility and Availability of such Borrower and that all conditions to the obligation of any Letter of Credit Issuer to issue a Letter of Credit under Sections 1.4(b) and (c) and Section 8.2 have been satisfied. If (i) the face amount of the requested Letter of Credit is less than the Unused Letter of Credit Subfacility and (ii) the amount of such requested Letter of Credit and all commissions, fees, and charges due from the requesting Borrower in connection with the opening thereof would not exceed Availability, such Borrower may apply to the Letter of Credit Issuer to issue the requested Letter of Credit on the requested issuance date so long as the other conditions hereof and under the applicable Issuing Bank Agreement are met. (e) Payments Pursuant to Letters of Credit. Each Borrower agrees to reimburse immediately the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer for any draw under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower and to pay the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer the amount of all other charges and fees payable to the Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with any Letter of Credit immediately when due, irrespective of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which such Borrower may have at any time against such Letter of Credit Issuer or any other Person. Each drawing under any Letter of Credit shall constitute a request by such Borrower to the Agent for a Borrowing of a Base Rate Loan in the amount of such drawing. The Funding Date with respect to such borrowing shall be the date of such drawing. (f) Indemnification; Exoneration; Power of Attorney. (i) Indemnification. In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere provided in this Section 1.4, each Borrower agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save the Lenders and the Agent harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) which any Lender or the Agent (other than a Lender in its capacity as Letter of Credit Issuer) may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit for the account of such Borrower, except to the extent it is determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such amounts arose as a direct result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or such Lender. The Borrowers' obligations under this Section shall survive payment of all other Obligations. (ii) Assumption of Risk by the Borrowers. As among the Borrowers, the Lenders, and the Agent, each Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of any of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Lenders (other than a Lender in its capacity as Letter of Credit Issuer) and the Agent shall not be responsible for: (A) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any Person in connection with the application for and issuance of and presentation of drafts with respect to any of the Letters of Credit, even if it should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) the failure of the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to comply duly with conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (D) errors, omissions, interruptions, or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (E) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (F) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (G) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; (H) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Lenders or the Agent, including any act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto Governmental Authority or (I) a Letter of Credit Issuer's honor of a draw for which the draw or any certificate fails to comply in any respect with the terms of the Letter of Credit. None of the foregoing shall affect, impair or prevent the vesting of any rights or powers of the Agent or any Lender under this Section 1.4(f). (iii) Exoneration. Without limiting the foregoing, no action or omission whatsoever by Agent or any Lender (excluding any Lender in its capacity as a Letter of Credit Issuer) shall result in any liability of Agent or any such Lender to any Borrower as of the result of or in connection with the issuance of any Letter of Credit, or relieve any Borrower of any of its obligations hereunder to any such Person under any Letter of Credit. (iv) Rights Against Letter of Credit Issuer. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to limit or increase any Borrower's rights, if any, with respect to a Letter of Credit Issuer which arise as a result of the Issuing Bank Agreement, the letter of credit application and related documents executed by and between such Borrower and a Letter of Credit Issuer. (v) Account Party. Each Borrower hereby authorizes and directs any Letter of Credit Issuer to name such Borrower as the "account party" therein and to deliver to the Agent all instruments, documents and other writings and property received by such Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to the Letter of Credit, and to accept and rely upon the Agent's instructions and agreements with respect to all matters arising in connection with the Letter of Credit or the application therefor. (g) Support of Letters of Credit. If, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.4(b) and Section 10.1, any Letter of Credit is outstanding 30 days prior to the termination of this Agreement, or upon such termination of this Agreement, then each applicable Borrower shall cause such letter of Credit to be Fully Supported. (h) Letter of Credit Reporting. Each Letter of Credit Issuer shall notify the Agent and the Agent shall notify the Lenders on the first Business Day of each week of the total face amount of all of the Letters of Credit issued by it on each Business Day of the preceding week. 1.5 Bank Products. Each Borrower may request and the Bank, the Bank's Affiliates and each other Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion, arrange for such Borrower to obtain from the Bank, its Affiliates or such Lender Bank Products, although such Borrower is not required to do so. If Bank Products are provided by an Affiliate of the Bank to a Borrower, such Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, the Bank and the other Lenders from any and all costs and obligations now or hereafter incurred by the Agent, the Bank or any of the Lenders which arise from any indemnity which shall not extend to gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Affiliates given by the Bank to its Affiliates related to such Bank Products; provided, however, nothing contained in this Section 1.5 is intended to limit such Borrower's rights with respect to any Lender, the Bank or its Affiliates, if any, which arise as a result of the execution of documents by and between such Borrower and a Lender or the Bank or its Affiliates which relate to Bank Products and to the extent the terms of indemnity of such documents are different from the terms of indemnity set forth above, the terms of such documents shall control; and provided further, that nothing contained in this Section 1.5 is intended to obligate any Lender, the Bank or its Affiliates or any Borrower to provide any indemnity in connection with any Bank Products other than the indemnity of a Borrower specifically provided for above. The agreement contained in this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of Bank Products from a Lender, the Bank or the Bank's Affiliates (a) is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Lender, the Bank or the Bank's Affiliates, and (b) is subject to all rules and regulations of such Lender, the Bank or the Bank's Affiliates. 1.6 Increase in Commitments (a) Provided no Default or Event of Default exists, upon written notice to the Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrowers may from time to time, request an increase in the Total Facility Amount and the aggregate Commitments hereunder by an amount (for all such requests that are satisfied) not exceeding $75,000,000. Such notice shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders). Each Lender shall notify the Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than, or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested increase. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase its Commitment. No Lender declining to increase its Commitment in connection with such a request shall be entitled to fees, if any, paid in connection with such Commitment increase. The Agent shall notify the Borrowers and each Lender of the Lenders' responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a requested increase, the Borrowers may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance acceptable to the Agent and subject to a $5,000,000 minimum Commitment amount for each such Eligible Assignee. (b) If the aggregate Commitments are increased in accordance with this Section, the Agent and the Borrowers shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final allocation of such increase. The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase Effective Date. As a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent a certificate of each Credit Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such Credit Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Credit Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and warranties contained in Article 6 and the other Loan Documents are true and correct on and as of the Extension Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 1.6, the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) of Section 6.6 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), of Section 5.2, and (B) no Default or Event of Default exists. On the Increase Effective Date, Schedule 1.1 shall be deemed to be deleted in its entirety and replaced with a new Schedule 1.1 reflecting the increased Commitments. The respective Lenders shall fund and/or be pre-paid, as applicable, any Loans outstanding on the Increase Effective Date (and the Borrowers shall pay any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 4.4) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Loans ratable with any revised Pro Rata Shares arising from any non-ratable increase in the Commitments under this Section. (c) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Sections 11.1 to the contrary. ARTICLE 2 INTEREST AND FEES 2.1 Interest. (a) Interest Rates. All outstanding Obligations shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof (including, to the extent permitted by law, on interest thereon not paid when due) from the date made until paid in full in cash at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margins as set forth below, but not to exceed the Maximum Rate. If at any time Loans are outstanding with respect to which the applicable Borrower has not delivered to the Agent a notice specifying the basis for determining the interest rate applicable thereto in accordance herewith, those Loans shall bear interest at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate until notice to the contrary has been given to the Agent in accordance with this Agreement and such notice has become effective. Except as otherwise provided herein, the outstanding Obligations shall bear interest as follows: (i) For all Base Rate Loans (other than LIBOR Loans) at a fluctuating per annum rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; and (ii) For all LIBOR Loans at a per annum rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin. Each change in the Base Rate shall be reflected in the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans as of the effective date of such change. All interest charges shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and actual days elapsed. (b) Payment of Interest. The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders, interest accrued on all Base Rate Loans in arrears on the first day of each month hereafter and on the Termination Date. The Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of Lenders, interest on all LIBOR Loans in arrears on each LIBOR Interest Payment Date. (c) Default Rate. Notwithstanding the rates of interest specified in Section 2.1(a) and the payment dates specified in Section 2.1(b), effective at the direction of the Agent after the occurrence of any Event of Default or after acceleration of maturity pursuant to Section 9.2(a) and for so long thereafter as any such Event of Default or acceleration shall be continuing, the principal balance of all Obligations then due and payable (including all amounts due and payable pursuant to Section 9.2(a)), shall bear interest payable upon demand at a rate which is 2% per annum in excess of the rate of interest otherwise payable under this Agreement. 2.2 Continuation and Conversion Elections. (a) Each Borrower may, except to the extent an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: (i) elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of Base Rate Loans to convert any Base Rate Loans (or any part thereof in an amount not less than $1,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) into LIBOR Loans; or (ii) elect, as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, to continue any LIBOR Loans having Interest Periods expiring on such day (or any part thereof in an amount not less than $1,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof); provided, that if at any time the aggregate amount of LIBOR Loans in respect of any Borrowing is reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of part thereof to be less than $1,000,000, such LIBOR Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans; provided further that if the notice shall fail to specify the duration of the Interest Period, such Interest Period shall be one month. (b) The applicable Borrower shall deliver a notice of continuation/conversion ("Notice of Continuation/Conversion") to the Agent not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) at least three (3) Business Days in advance of the Continuation/Conversion Date, if the Loans are to be converted into or continued as LIBOR Loans and specifying: (i) the proposed Continuation/Conversion Date; (ii) the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or renewed; (iii) the type of Loans resulting from the proposed conversion or continuation; and (iv) the duration of the requested Interest Period, provided, however, such Borrower may not select an Interest Period that ends after the Stated Termination Date. (c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to LIBOR Loans, the applicable Borrower has failed to select timely a new Interest Period to be applicable to LIBOR Loans or if any Event of Default then exists, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such Interest Period. (d) The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a Notice of Continuation/Conversion. All conversions and continuations shall be made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans with respect to which the notice was given held by each Lender. (e) There may not be more than five (5) different LIBOR Loans in effect hereunder at any time. 2.3 Maximum Interest Rate. In no event shall any interest rate provided for hereunder exceed the maximum rate legally chargeable by any Lender under applicable law for such Lender with respect to loans of the type provided for hereunder (the "Maximum Rate"). If, in any month, any interest rate, absent such limitation, would have exceeded the Maximum Rate, then the interest rate for that month shall be the Maximum Rate, and, if in future months, that interest rate would otherwise be less than the Maximum Rate, then that interest rate shall remain at the Maximum Rate until such time as the amount of interest paid hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been paid if the same had not been limited by the Maximum Rate. In the event that, upon payment in full of the Obligations, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the terms of this Agreement is less than the total amount of interest which would, but for this Section 2.3, have been paid or accrued if the interest rate otherwise set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then such Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, an amount equal to the excess of (a) the lesser of (i) the amount of interest which would have been charged if the Maximum Rate had, at all times, been in effect or (ii) the amount of interest which would have accrued had the interest rate otherwise set forth in this Agreement, at all times, been in effect over (b) the amount of interest actually paid or accrued under this Agreement. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Agent and/or any Lender has received interest and other charges hereunder in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess shall be deemed received on account of, and shall automatically be applied to reduce, the Obligations other than interest, and if there are no Obligations outstanding, the Agent and/or such Lender shall refund to such Borrower such excess. 2.4 Closing Fee. The Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay the Agent on the Effective Date the fees (the "Closing Fees") payable on such date as set forth in the fee letter dated September 15, 2003, between the Agent and ATI (the "Fee Letter"). 2.5 Unused Line Fee. On the first day of each month and on the Termination Date the Borrowers agree, jointly and severally, to pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, an unused line fee (the "Unused Line Fee") equal to the Applicable Margin for the Unused Line Fee times the amount by which the Total Facility Amount exceeded the sum of the average daily outstanding amount of Revolving Loans and the average daily undrawn face amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, during the immediately preceding month or shorter period if calculated for the first month hereafter or on the Termination Date. The Unused Line Fee shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, for the actual number of days elapsed. All principal payments received by the Agent shall be deemed to be credited to the applicable Borrower's Loan Account immediately upon receipt for purposes of calculating the Unused Line Fee pursuant to this Section 2.5. 2.6 Letter of Credit Fee. Each Borrower agrees (a) to pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, (i) for each Commercial Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, a fee (the "Commercial Letter of Credit Fee") at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for the Commercial Letter of Credit Fee multiplied by the maximum amount available to be drawn on such Commercial Letter of Credit and (ii) for each Standby Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, a fee (the "Standby Letter of Credit Fee") at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans multiplied by the maximum amount available to be drawn on such Standby Letter of Credit, (b) to pay to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer a fronting fee (the "Fronting Fee") of one-eighth of one percent (.125%) of the undrawn face amount of each Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, and (c) to pay to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer, such out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with the application for, processing of, issuance of, or amendment to any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, as the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer and such Borrower shall agree upon, but which costs, fees and expenses shall not include the Fronting Fee. The Commercial Letter of Credit Fee and the Standby Letter of Credit Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month following any month in which such a Letter of Credit is outstanding and on the Termination Date. The Fronting Fee shall be payable on each date of issuance or renewal (automatic or otherwise) of each Letter of Credit. All fees described in this Section 2.6 shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, for the actual number of days elapsed. 2.6 Letter of Credit Fee. Each Borrower agrees (a) to pay to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, (i) for each Commercial Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, a fee (the "Commercial Letter of Credit Fee") equal to the Applicable Margin for the Commercial Letter of Credit Fee and (ii) for each Standby Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, a fee (the "Standby Letter of Credit Fee") equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR Loans, (b) to pay to the Agent for the benefit of the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer a fronting fee (the "Fronting Fee") of one-eighth of one percent (.125%) of the undrawn face amount of each Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, and (c) to pay to the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer, such out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Letter of Credit Issuer in connection with the application for, processing of, issuance of, or amendment to any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, as the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer and such Borrower shall agree upon, but which costs, fees and expenses shall not include the Fronting Fee. The Commercial Letter of Credit Fee and the Standby Letter of Credit Fee shall be payable monthly in arrears on the first day of each month following any month in which such a Letter of Credit is outstanding and on the Termination Date. The Fronting Fee shall be payable on each date of issuance or renewal (automatic or otherwise) of each Letter of Credit. All fees described in this Section 2.6 shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, for the actual number of days elapsed. ARTICLE 3 PAYMENTS AND PREPAYMENTS 3.1 Revolving Loans. Each Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loans made to it, plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon, on the Termination Date. Each Borrower may prepay Revolving Loans made to it at any time, and reborrow subject to the terms of this Agreement. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon demand by the Agent the Borrowers shall pay to the Agent, for account of the Lenders, the amount, without duplication, by which the Aggregate Outstandings exceeds the lesser of the Borrowing Base or the Total Facility Amount. 3.2 Termination of Facility. The Borrowers may terminate this Agreement upon at least five (5) Business Days' notice to the Agent and the Lenders, upon (a) the payment in full of all outstanding Revolving Loans, together with accrued interest thereon, and the cancellation and return of all outstanding Letters of Credit or such Letters of Credit being Fully Supported, (b) the payment in full in cash of all reimbursable expenses and other Obligations, and (c) with respect to any LIBOR Loans prepaid, payment of the amounts due under Section 4.4, if any, in each case on the Termination Date. 3.3 [Intentionally omitted.] 3.4 [Intentionally omitted.] 3.5 [Intentionally omitted.] 3.6 Payments by the Borrowers. (a) All payments to be made by the Borrowers shall be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers shall be made to the Agent for the account of the Lenders, at the account designated by the Agent and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date specified herein. Any payment received by the Agent after such time shall be deemed (for purposes of calculating interest only) to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest shall continue to accrue. (b) Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest Period", whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be due on the following Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may be. (c) If any LIBOR Loans are repaid prior to the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrowers shall pay to the Lenders the amounts described in Section 4.4. 3.7 Payments as Revolving Loans. At the election of Agent, all payments of principal, interest, reimbursement obligations in connection with Letters of Credit, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses and other sums payable hereunder, may be paid from the proceeds of Revolving Loans made hereunder. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent to charge the Loan Account of such Borrower for the purpose of paying all amounts from time to time due hereunder in respect of principal, interest or fees (or, during the continuance of an Event of Default, all other Obligations) and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Revolving Loans. 3.8 Apportionment, Application and Reversal of Payments. Principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which such payments relate held by each Lender) and payments of the fees shall, as applicable, be apportioned ratably among the Lenders, except for fees payable solely to Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuers and except as provided in Section 11.1(b). All payments shall be remitted to the Agent and all such payments not relating to principal or interest of specific Loans, or not constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of Accounts or other Collateral received by the Agent, shall be applied, ratably, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, first, to pay any fees, indemnities or expense reimbursements and amounts due under ACH Transactions and cash management or controlled disbursement services then due to the Agent or any Lender providing ACH Transactions or cash management or controlled disbursement services from any Credit Party; second, to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from any Credit Party; third, to pay interest due in respect of all Loans, including Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances; fourth, to pay or prepay principal of the Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances; fifth, to pay or prepay principal of the Revolving Loans (other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances) and unpaid reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit; sixth, to pay an amount to the Agent equal to all outstanding Letter of Credit Obligations to be held as cash collateral for such Obligations, solely, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default or acceleration of the Obligations hereunder, to the extent such Letter of Credit Obligations exceed the Borrowing Base; seventh, to the payment of any other Obligation due to the Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate of the Bank by any Credit Party (including any Obligations arising under Bank Products not otherwise already paid); and eighth, to the Borrowers or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Borrowers, or unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall apply any payments which it receives to any LIBOR Loan, except (a) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such LIBOR Loan, or (b) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding Base Rate Loans. The Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Obligations in accordance with the second sentence of this Section 3.8. 3.9 Indemnity for Returned Payments. If after receipt of any payment which is applied to the payment of all or any part of the Obligations, the Agent, any Lender, any Letter of Credit Issuer, the Bank or any Affiliate of the Bank (each an "Affected Payee") is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or proceeds to any Person because such payment or application of proceeds is invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable as a preference, impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any other reason, then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued and this Agreement shall continue in full force as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Affected Payee and the applicable Borrower or Borrowers shall be liable to pay to the Affected Payee, and hereby does indemnify the Affected Payee and holds harmless the Affected Payee, for the amount of such payment or proceeds surrendered. The provisions of this Section 3.9 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may have been taken by the Affected Payee in reliance upon such payment or application of proceeds, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without prejudice to the Affected Payee's rights under this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment or application of proceeds having become final and irrevocable. The provisions of this Section 3.9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement. 3.10 Agent's and Lenders' Books and Records; Monthly Statements. The Agent shall record the principal amount of the Loans owing to each Lender, the undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and the aggregate amount of unpaid reimbursement obligations outstanding with respect to the Letters of Credit from time to time on its books. In addition, each Lender may note the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of such Lender's Loans in its books and records. Failure by Agent or any Lender to make such notation shall not affect the obligations of the Borrowers with respect to the Loans or the Letters of Credit. Each Borrower agrees that the Agent's and each Lender's books and records showing the Obligations and the transactions pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be admissible in any action or proceeding arising therefrom, and shall constitute rebuttably presumptive proof thereof (absent manifest error), irrespective of whether any Obligation is also evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument. The Agent will provide to ATI, on behalf of the Borrowers, a monthly statement of Loans, payments, and other transactions pursuant to this Agreement. Such statement shall be deemed presumptively correct, accurate, and binding on the Borrowers and an account stated (except for reversals and reapplications of payments made as provided in Section 3.8 and corrections of errors discovered by the Agent), unless the Borrowers (or ATI on their behalf) notify the Agent in writing to the contrary within thirty (30) days after such statement is rendered. In the event a timely written notice of objections is given by a Borrower (or ATI on behalf of such Borrower), only the items to which exception is expressly made will be considered to be disputed by such Borrower. ARTICLE 4 TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY 4.1 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrowers hereunder shall be made, in accordance with Article 3, free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. If any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (i) so long as such Lender or the Agent is in compliance with Section 12.10, the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 4.1) and withholding such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and withholding, and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. If a withholding tax of the United States of America or any other Governmental Authority shall be or become applicable (y) after the date of this Agreement, to such payments by the Borrowers made to the applicable lending office or any other office that a Lender may claim as its applicable lending office or (z) after such Lender's selection and designation of any other applicable lending office, to such payments made to such other applicable lending office, such Lender shall, in good faith, use its reasonable best efforts to make, fund and maintain its Loans, and to make, fund and maintain its Obligations under the Letters of Credit, through another applicable lending office of such Lender in another jurisdiction so as to reduce the Borrowers' liability hereunder, if the making, funding or maintenance of such Loans or Obligations under the Letters of Credit through such other applicable lending office of such Lender does not, in the judgment of such Lender, otherwise materially adversely affect such Loans, Obligations under the Letters of Credit or such Lender. (b) In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any Other Taxes. (c) Each Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority on amounts payable under this Section 4.1) paid by such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, and any liability (including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally asserted by such Governmental Authority. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date such Lender or the Agent, as applicable, makes written demand therefor. A certificate as to any additional amount payable to any Lender under this Section 4.1 submitted to such Borrower and the Agent (if a Lender is so submitting) by such Lender or the Agent shall show in reasonable detail the amount payable and the calculations used to determine such amount and shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto. Each Lender agrees that, to the extent that such Lender is entitled to claim an exemption in respect of all or a portion of any Taxes which are otherwise required to be paid or deducted or withheld pursuant to this Section 4.1 in respect of any payments under this Agreement such Lender shall within a reasonable time after receiving written request by such Borrower provide such Borrower with such certificates as Lender in good faith may deem appropriate to obtain the benefits of such exemption. (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other Taxes by a Borrower, such Borrower will furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 14.8, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. (e) No Borrower shall be required to indemnify any Lender that is not a "United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code ("Non-U.S. Lender"), or to pay any additional amounts to any Non-U.S. Lender, in respect of any Taxes (and any penalties, interest and expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto) pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above to the extent that payments made pursuant to this Agreement to such Non-U.S. Lender were subject to such Taxes on the date such Non-U.S. Lender became a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of a Participant, on the date such Participant became a transferee of a participation interest hereunder) or, with respect to payments to an Assignee, the date such Non-U.S. Lender designated assigned such a Loan to such Assignee. (f) If the Agent or any Lender receives a refund, which in the good faith judgment of such Lender is allocable to Taxes or Other Taxes paid by any Borrower, it shall promptly pay such refund to such Borrower, net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender incurred in obtaining such refund, provided, however, that such Borrower agrees to promptly return such refund to the Agent or the applicable Lender, as applicable, if it receives notice from the Agent or the applicable Lender that such Agent or Lender is required to repay such refund. In addition, the Lender shall take such steps as the applicable Borrower shall reasonably request to recover or assist such Borrower in recovering any Taxes or Other Taxes paid by such Borrower pursuant to paragraph (a) or (c) above. (g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained in this Section 4.1 shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest hereunder, the termination of the Letters of Credit and the termination of this Agreement. (h) The Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay any additional amounts in respect of United States federal income tax (or make an indemnification payment) pursuant to this Section 4.1 to any Lender (including, without limitation, any entity to which any Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers its rights under this Agreement) if the obligation to pay such additional amounts (or such indemnification) would not have arisen but for a failure of such Lender to comply with its obligations under Section 12.10. 4.2 Illegality. (a) If after the date of this Agreement the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make LIBOR Loans, then, on notice thereof by that Lender to the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) through the Agent, any obligation of that Lender to make LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until that Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. (b) If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any LIBOR Loan, each Borrower shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact and demand from a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay in full such LIBOR Loans of that Lender then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon and amounts required under Section 4.4, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if that Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Loans to such day, or immediately, if that Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Loans. If a Borrower is required to so prepay any LIBOR Loans, then concurrently with such prepayment, such Borrower shall borrow from the affected Lender, in the amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Loan. 4.3 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return. (a) If any Lender determines that due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in the interpretation of any law or regulation after the date of this Agreement or (ii) the compliance by that Lender with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost (excluding in each case for purposes of this Section 4.3(a), any such increased costs resulting from Taxes or Other Taxes, as to which Section 4.1 shall govern) to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any LIBOR Loans, then the applicable Borrower shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand (with a copy of such demand to be sent to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased costs. (b) If any Lender shall have determined that (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by such Lender or any corporation or other entity controlling such Lender with any Capital Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation or other entity controlling such Lender and (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's or other entity's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its Commitments, loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such Lender to the applicable Borrower through the Agent, such Borrower shall pay to such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increase. 4.4 Funding Losses. Each Borrower shall reimburse each Lender and hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a consequence of: (a) the failure of such Borrower to make on a timely basis any payment of principal of any LIBOR Loan; (b) the failure of such Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Loan after such Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Continuation/Conversion; or (c) the prepayment or other payment (including after acceleration thereof) of any LIBOR Loans on a day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; including any expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain its LIBOR Loans or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. Each Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by any Lender in connection with the foregoing. 4.5 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Agent determines that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan, or that the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding such Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) and each Lender (a "Rate Suspension Notice"). Upon receipt of such Rate Suspension Notice, a Borrower may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion then submitted by it. If such Borrower does not revoke such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion, the Lenders shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by such Borrower, in the amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by such Borrower, but such Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of LIBOR Loans. After the giving of any Rate Suspension Notice and until Agent shall otherwise notify the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) and the Lenders in writing that the circumstances giving rise to such condition no longer exist, the Borrowers' right to request the making of or conversion to, and the Lenders' obligations to make or convert to, LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended. Any LIBOR Rate Loans outstanding at the commencement of any such suspension shall be converted at the end of the then current Interest Period for such Loans into Base Rate Loans unless such suspension has then ended or LIBOR Rate Loans for another Interest Period are then available. 4.6 Certificates of Agent. If any Lender claims reimbursement or compensation under this Article 4, Agent shall verify the amount thereof and shall deliver to the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) (with a copy to the affected Lender) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable to the affected Lender, and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrowers in the absence of manifest error. 4.7 Survival. The agreements and obligations of the Borrowers in this Article 4 shall survive the payment of all other Obligations. 4.8 Replacement of Lenders. (a) If and with respect to each occasion that a Lender other than the Agent either makes a demand for compensation pursuant to Sections 4.1 or 4.3 or is unable to fund LIBOR Rate Loans pursuant to Section 4.2 or such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Borrowers may, upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior irrevocable written notice to each of such Lender and Agent, in whole permanently replace the Commitment of such Lender; provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such proposed replacement of the Commitment of such Lender, and (ii) the Borrowers shall replace such Commitment with the Commitment of a financial institution reasonably satisfactory to Agent (and such consent of the Agent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Such replacement Lender shall upon the effective date of replacement purchase the Loans owed to such replaced Lender for the aggregate amount thereof and shall thereupon for all purposes become a "Lender" hereunder. Such notice from the Borrowers shall specify an effective date for the replacement of such Lender's Commitment, which date shall not be later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the day such notice is given. On the effective date of any replacement of such Lender's Commitment pursuant to this Section 4.9, the Borrowers shall pay to Agent for the account of such Lender (a) any fees due to such Lender to the date of such replacement; (b) accrued interest on the principal amount of outstanding Loans held by such Lender to the date of such replacement, and (c) the amount or amounts requested by such Lender pursuant to Article 4. On or before the effective date for the replacement of such Lender's Commitment, the Borrowers will cause any Letter of Credit issued by such replaced Lender to be terminated or transferred to the replacement Lender or to another Lender. Upon the effective date of repayment of any Lender's Loans, the termination or transfer of such Lender's Letters of Credit and termination of such Lender's Commitment pursuant to this Section 4.9, such Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder. No such termination of any such Lender's Commitment and the purchase of such Lender's Loans and termination or transfer of such Lender's Letters of Credit pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall affect (i) any liability or obligation of the Borrowers or any other Lender to such terminated Lender which accrued on or prior to the date of such termination or which by the terms of this Agreement expressly survive termination hereof or (ii) such terminated Lender's rights hereunder in respect of any such liability or obligation. ARTICLE 5 BOOKS AND RECORDS; FINANCIAL INFORMATION; NOTICES 5.1 Books and Records. Each Borrower shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain, at all times, correct and complete books, records and accounts in which complete, correct and timely entries are made of its transactions in accordance with GAAP applied consistently with the audited Financial Statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.2(a). Each Borrower shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, by means of appropriate entries, reflect in such accounts and in all Financial Statements proper liabilities and reserves for all taxes and proper provision for depreciation and amortization of property and bad debts, all in accordance with GAAP. Each Borrower shall, and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to, maintain at all times books and records pertaining to the Collateral in such detail, form and scope as the Agent shall reasonably require, including, but not limited to, records of (a) all payments received and all credits and extensions granted with respect to the Accounts; (b) the return, rejection, repossession, stoppage in transit, loss, damage, or destruction of any Inventory; and (c) all other dealings affecting the Collateral. 5.2 Financial Information. Each Borrower shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, promptly furnish to each Lender, all such financial information as the Agent shall reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing, each Borrower will furnish to the Agent, in sufficient copies for distribution by the Agent to each Lender, in such detail as the Agent or the Lenders shall reasonably request, the following: (a) As soon as available, but in any event not later than ninety (90) days after the close of each Fiscal Year, a consolidated audited balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and statement of change in stockholders' equity for the Parent and its Subsidiaries for such Fiscal Year, and the accompanying notes thereto, setting forth in each case in comparative form figures for the previous Fiscal Year, all in reasonable detail, fairly presenting the financial position and the results of operations of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the date thereof and for the Fiscal Year then ended, and prepared in accordance with GAAP. Such statements shall be examined in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by and, in the case of such statements performed on a consolidated basis, accompanied by a report thereon unqualified in any respect of independent certified public accountants selected by the Borrowers and reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. Each Borrower hereby authorizes the Agent to communicate directly with its certified public accountants and, by this provision, authorizes those accountants to disclose to the Agent any and all financial statements and other supporting financial documents and schedules relating to such Borrower and to discuss directly with the Agent the finances and affairs of such Borrower; provided, however, the Agent shall give ATI not less than five (5) days prior written notice of any such communication, disclosure or discussion and nothing in this Section 5.2(a) shall limit the right of any of the Borrowers to be present during any such discussions. (b) As soon as available, but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal quarter (other than the last fiscal quarter of any Fiscal Year), a consolidated unaudited balance sheet as of the end of such period, income statement and cash flow statement for the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries for such fiscal quarter and for the period from the beginning of the Fiscal Year to the end of such fiscal quarter, all in reasonable detail, fairly presenting the financial position and results of operations of the Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the date thereof and for such periods, and in each case in comparable form, figures for the corresponding period in the prior Fiscal Year, and prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently with the audited Financial Statements required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.2(a) (subject to normal year-end adjustments), together with a report identifying all Unrestricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, if Liquidity shall be less than $100,000,000 at any time, the Financial Statements described in this Section 5.2(b) shall thereafter (until Liquidity is more than $100,000,000 for 90 consecutive days) be provided monthly no later than 30 days after the end of each month and be prepared on a monthly basis. Each Borrower shall certify by a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer that all such statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and present fairly the Parent's and its Subsidiaries consolidated financial position as at the dates thereof and its results of operations for the periods then ended, subject to normal year-end adjustments. (c) With each of the audited Financial Statements delivered pursuant to Section 5.2(a), a certificate of the independent certified public accountants that examined such statement to the effect that they have reviewed and are familiar with this Agreement and that, in examining such Financial Statements, they did not become aware of any fact or condition which then constituted a Default or Event of Default with respect to a financial covenant, except for those, if any, described in reasonable detail in such certificate. (d) Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each fiscal quarter, a certificate of a Responsible Officer of ATI in the form of Exhibit A hereto setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations required to establish that the Borrowers were in compliance with the applicable covenants set forth therein at the end of such fiscal quarter, and stating that, except as explained in reasonable detail in such certificate, (i) all of the representations and warranties of the Borrowers contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are correct and complete in all material respects as at the date of such certificate as if made at such time, except for those that speak as of a particular date, (ii) the Borrowers are, at the date of such certificate, in compliance in all material respects with all of their respective covenants and agreements in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (iii) no Default or Event of Default then exists, and (iv) no Illiquidity Period has arisen or been in effect during such fiscal quarter, and setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation of Liquidity as of the end of such fiscal quarter; provided, however, that the confirmation of the representations and warranties in clause (i) above is solely for purposes of supplemental disclosure and shall not be considered a making or a deemed making of such representations and warranties for the purpose of Section 9.1(b) or otherwise. If such certificate discloses that a representation or warranty is not correct or complete, or that a covenant has not been complied with, or that a Default or Event of Default existed or exists, such certificate shall set forth what action the Borrowers have taken or proposes to take with respect thereto. (e) Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month during which any portion of an Illiquidity Period shall be in effect, a certificate of a Responsible Officer of ATI in the form of Exhibit A hereto setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations required to establish that the Borrowers were in compliance with the covenant set forth in Section 7.24 at the end of such month.

(k) Within fifteen (15) days following the end of each month, a Borrowing Base Certificate for such month, together with a detailed calculation of Eligible Accounts, Eligible Inventory, Eligible Equipment and Eligible Real Estate and a reconciliation to the corresponding Borrowing Base and to the Borrowers' general ledger; provided, however, if Liquidity shall at any time be less than $100,000,000, the Borrowing Base Certificate shall be accompanied by (i) a schedule of Eligible Accounts; (ii) an aging of Accounts, together with a reconciliation to the corresponding Borrowing Base and to the Borrowers' general ledger; (iii) an aging of all Borrowers' accounts payable; (iv) Inventory reports by category and location, together with a reconciliation to the corresponding Borrowing Base and to the Borrowers' general ledger; (v) such other reports as to the Collateral as the Agent shall reasonably request from time to time; and (vi) with the delivery of each of the foregoing, a certificate of a Responsible Officer of ATI certifying as to the accuracy and completeness of the foregoing; provided further, however, if Liquidity shall at any time be less than $50,000,000, the Borrowing Base Certificate and, to the extent requested by the Agent, other information described in this Section 5.2(k) shall thereafter be provided weekly. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the documents and information required to be provided under this Section 5.2(k) shall be provided on a more frequent basis than set forth herein if and as requested by the Agent. If records or reports of the Collateral of type required to be delivered hereunder are prepared by an accounting service or other agent, each Borrower hereby authorizes such service or agent to deliver such records, reports, and related documents (but only to the extent necessary to satisfy the foregoing reporting requirements) to the Agent, for distribution to the Lenders; provided however, the Agent shall give written notice to ATI not less than five (5) days prior to any such contact with such accounting service or agent.

(a) Each Borrower shall, and shall cause the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries to, conduct its business in compliance with all Environmental Laws applicable to it, including those relating to the generation, handling, use, storage, and disposal of any Contaminant unless the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and the Borrowers shall, and shall cause the Parent and each of its Subsidiaries to, take prompt and appropriate action to respond to any such non-compliance with Environmental Laws and shall regularly report to the Agent on such response. (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ATI shall submit to the Agent and the Lenders annually, commencing on the first Anniversary Date, and on each Anniversary Date thereafter, copies of any material notices received by the Borrowers from any Governmental Authority under any Environmental Law, if any, and copies of any environmental reports prepared by the Borrowers, in each case prepared by or received by the Borrowers during such prior year, if any. The Agent or any Lender may request copies of technical reports prepared by any Borrower and its communications with any Governmental Authority to determine whether such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is proceeding reasonably to correct, cure or contest in good faith any alleged non-compliance or environmental liability. At any time after the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, each Borrower shall, at the Agent's or the Required Lenders' request and at the applicable Borrower's expense, with respect to any Mortgaged Property (i) retain an independent environmental engineer acceptable to the Agent to evaluate the site, including tests if appropriate, where the Agent has a reasonable basis to believe any material non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with Environmental Laws has occurred and prepare and deliver to the Agent, in sufficient quantity for distribution by the Agent to the Lenders, a report setting forth the results of such evaluation, a proposed plan for responding to any environmental problems described therein, and an estimate of the costs thereof, and (ii) provide to the Agent and the Lenders a supplemental report of such engineer whenever the scope of the environmental problems, or the response thereto or the estimated costs thereof, shall increase in any material respect; provided that the Agent and its representatives will have the right at any reasonable time to enter and visit such Mortgaged Property and for the purposes of observing such Mortgaged Property. The Agent is under no duty, however, to visit or observe the Mortgaged Property or to conduct tests, and any such acts by the Agent will be solely for the purposes of protecting the Agent's Liens and preserving the Agent and the Lenders' rights under the Loan Documents. No site visit, observation or testing by the Agent and the Lenders will result in a waiver of any default of any Borrower or impose any liability on the Agent or the Lenders. In no event will any site visit, observation or testing by the Agent be a representation that hazardous substances are or are not present in, on or under the Mortgaged Property, or that there has been or will be compliance with any Environmental Law. None of the Borrowers, any other Credit Party nor any other party is entitled to rely on any site visit, observation or testing by the Agent. The Agent and the Lenders owe no duty of care to protect the Borrowers, any other Credit Party or any other party against, or to inform the Borrowers, any other Credit Party or any other party of, any hazardous substances or any other adverse condition affecting the Mortgaged Property. The Agent may in its discretion disclose to the Borrowers or to any other party if so required by law any report or findings made as a result of, or in connection with, any site visit, observation or testing by the Agent. Each Borrower understands and agrees that the Agent makes no warranty or representation to the Borrowers or any other party regarding the truth, accuracy or completeness of any such report or findings that may be disclosed. Each Borrower also understands that depending on the results of any site visit, observation or testing by the Agent and disclosed to the Borrowers, the Borrowers, the Parent, or its Subsidiaries may have a legal obligation to notify one or more environmental agencies of the results, that such reporting requirements are site-specific, and are to be evaluated by the applicable Borrower without advice or assistance from the Agent. In each instance, the Agent will give the applicable Borrower reasonable notice before entering such Mortgaged Property. The Agent will make reasonable efforts to avoid interfering with such Borrower's or any other Credit Party's use of such Mortgaged Property or any other property in exercising any rights provided hereunder. 7.8 Compliance with ERISA.

(a) Until the Agent notifies ATI to the contrary, the Credit Parties shall make collection of all Accounts and other Collateral for the Agent, shall receive all payments as the Agent's trustee, and shall immediately deliver all payments in their original form duly endorsed in blank into one or more Approved Deposit Accounts established in the name of such Credit Party. All amounts deposited into such Approved Deposit Accounts shall be swept on a daily basis and transferred to the Payment Account for further dispersal subject to the Blocked Account Agreement. None of the Borrowers shall make any material change in their cash management practices, including any change that would cause amounts held in any Approved Deposit Account not to be swept on a daily basis to the Payment Account. Following receipt of written notice from the Agent that an Activation Period (as defined below) exists and until receipt of written notice from the Agent that all Activation Periods have terminated, the Clearing Bank shall not permit any Credit Party to make any withdrawals from the Payment Account. Prior to or after the termination of an Activation Period, the Credit Parties shall have the right to operate and transact business through the Payment Account in normal fashion, including making withdrawals from the Payment Account, but covenants to the Agent it will not close the Payment Account. No later than two (2) Business Days following the commencement of the Activation Period, and continuing on each Business Day thereafter, the Clearing Bank shall transfer all collected and available balances in the Payment Account to the Agent as the Agent shall direct. The "Activation Period" means each period which (a) commences upon the day that either (i) Liquidity is less than $30,000,000 or (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and (b) terminates on the day Liquidity is in excess of $50,000,000 for a period of fifteen (15) consecutive days or such Event of Default has been waived, as applicable. (b) To the extent there are no Loans outstanding after application of such collections in a Payment Account and no Event of Default exists and no Activation Period is otherwise in effect, the Borrowers may direct, or the Agent may in its discretion without such direction direct, that any excess collections be deposited in the Designated Account. The Agent or the Agent's designee may, at any time that an Event of Default exists, notify Account Debtors that the Accounts have been assigned to the Agent and of the Agent's security interest therein, and may collect them directly and charge the collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account as a Revolving Loan. So long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Credit Party, at the Agent's request, shall execute and deliver to the Agent such documents as the Agent shall reasonably require to grant the Agent access to any post office box in which collections of Accounts are received. (c) If sales of Inventory are made or services are rendered for cash, each Credit Party shall promptly deliver to the Agent or deposit into a Deposit Account which is swept in the ordinary course of business into the Payment Account the cash which such Credit Party receives. (d) All payments received by the Agent at a bank account designated by it, will be the Agent's sole property for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders and will be credited to the Loan Account immediately (conditional upon final collection) if received no later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) and otherwise on the next Business Day.

Without in any way requiring notice to be given in the following manner, each Borrower agrees that any notice by the Agent of sale, disposition or other intended action hereunder or in connection herewith, whether required by the UCC or otherwise, shall constitute reasonable notice to such Borrower if such notice is mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or is delivered personally against receipt, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to such action to such Borrower's address specified in or pursuant to Section 13.8.

The proceeds of sale shall be applied first to all expenses of sale, including attorneys' fees, and then to the Obligations. The Agent will return any excess to such Borrower and such Borrower shall remain liable for any deficiency. (c) If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, each Borrower hereby waives all rights to notice and hearing prior to the exercise by the Agent of the Agent's rights to repossess the Collateral without judicial process or to reply, attach or levy upon the Collateral without notice or hearing. ARTICLE 10 TERM AND TERMINATION 10.1 Term and Termination. The term of this Agreement shall end on the Stated Termination Date unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms hereof. The Agent upon direction from the Required Lenders may terminate this Agreement without notice upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default. Upon the effective date of termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, all Obligations (including all unpaid principal, accrued and unpaid interest and any early termination or prepayment fees or penalties (but excluding obligations under Bank Products)) shall become immediately due and payable and the Borrowers shall immediately arrange for the Letters of Credit then outstanding to be Fully Supported. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement and subject to any provisions of this Agreement that expressly survive termination hereof, until all Obligations are indefeasibly paid and performed in full in cash, each Borrower shall remain bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall not be relieved of any of its Obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, and the Agent and the Lenders shall retain all their rights and remedies hereunder (including the Agent's Liens in and all rights and remedies with respect to all then existing and after-arising Collateral). ARTICLE 11 AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; PARTICIPATIONS; ASSIGNMENTS; SUCCESSORS 11.1 Amendments and Waivers. (a) No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any departure by any Borrower or any other Credit Party therefrom, shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders (or by the Agent at the written request of the Required Lenders) and each Borrower and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Lenders and each Borrower and acknowledged by the Agent, do any of the following: (i) increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender; (ii) postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Lenders (or any of them) hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (iii) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on any Loan, or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (iv) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans which is required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder; (v) increase any of the percentages set forth in the definition of the Borrowing Base or in the proviso to Section 1.2(i); (vi) amend this Section or any provision of this Agreement providing for consent or other action by all Lenders; (vii) release any Borrower or any Guaranties of the Obligations or release Collateral other than as permitted by Sections 7.16(a)(iii) and 12.11; (viii) change the definition of "Required Lenders"; or (ix) increase the Total Facility Amount or Letter of Credit Subfacility; provided, however, the Agent may, in its sole discretion and notwithstanding the limitations contained in clauses (v) and (ix) above and any other terms of this Agreement, make Agent Advances in accordance with Section 1.2(i) and, provided further, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent, affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and provided further, that Schedule 1.1 hereto (Commitments) may be amended from time to time by Agent alone to reflect assignments of Commitments in accordance herewith. (b) If any fees are paid to the Lenders as consideration for amendments, waivers or consents with respect to this Agreement, at Agent's election, such fees may be paid only to those Lenders that agree to such amendments, waivers or consents within the time specified for submission thereof. (c) If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent (a "Proposed Change") requiring the consent of all Lenders, the consent of Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is not obtained as described in this clause (c) being referred to as a "Non-Consenting Lender"), then, so long as the Agent is not a Non-Consenting Lender, at the Borrowers' request, the Agent or an Eligible Assignee shall have the right (but not the obligation) with the Agent's approval, to purchase from the Non-Consenting Lenders, and the Non-Consenting Lenders agree that they shall sell, all the Non-Consenting Lenders' Commitments for an amount equal to the principal balances thereof and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto through the date of sale pursuant to Assignment and Acceptance Agreement(s), without premium or discount. 11.2 Assignments; Participations. (a) Any Lender may assign and delegate to one or more Eligible Assignees (each an "Assignee") all, or any ratable part of all, of the Loans, the Commitments and the other rights and obligations of such Lender hereunder, in a minimum amount of $1,000,000 (provided that, unless an assignor Lender has assigned and delegated all of its Loans and Commitments, no such assignment and/or delegation shall be permitted unless, after giving effect thereto, such assignor Lender retains a Commitment in a minimum amount of $5,000,000); provided, however, that the Borrowers and the Agent may continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with the interest so assigned to an Assignee until (i) written notice of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses and related information with respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) and the Agent by such Lender and the Assignee; (ii) such Lender and its Assignee shall have delivered to the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) and the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit F ("Assignment and Acceptance") together with any note or notes subject to such assignment and (iii) the assignor Lender or Assignee has paid to the Agent a processing fee in the amount of $3,500. Each Borrower agrees to promptly execute and deliver promissory notes and replacement promissory notes as reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender to evidence assignments of the Loans and Commitments in accordance herewith. (b) From and after the date that the Agent notifies the assignor Lender that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the above-referenced processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations, including, but not limited to, the obligation to participate in Letters of Credit have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Lender shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto). (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto or the attachment, perfection, or priority of any Lien granted by any Borrower to the Agent or any Lender in the Collateral; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Borrower or the performance or observance by any Borrower of any of its obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such Assignee will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such Assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers, including the discretionary rights and incidental power, as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such Assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender. (d) Immediately upon satisfaction of the requirements of Section 11.2(a), this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto. (e) Any Lender may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks, financial institutions, or other Persons not Affiliates of any Borrower (a "Participant") participating interests in any Loans, the Commitment of that Lender and the other interests of that Lender (the "originating Lender") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that (i) the originating Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the originating Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrowers and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the originating Lender in connection with the originating Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (iv) no Lender shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document except the matters set forth in Section 11.1(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), and (v) all amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation; except that, if amounts outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same limitation as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement. If a Lender sells a participating interest in its Loans, commitments or other interests hereunder as described above, such Lender shall thereafter maintain at its address specified on the signature pages hereto, as agent for the Borrowers, a register (the "Participation Register") for the recordation of the names and addresses of each Participant and the principal amounts of each such participation. A Participant may not, with respect to such participation, enter into any subparticipation or otherwise subdivide, sell, transfer or assign any of its rights therein without prior written consent of the applicable Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event that the Lender consents to the proposed subparticipation, sale, transfer or assignment of or with respect to any participation (any such subdivision, sale, transfer or assignment, a "Transfer"), the Lender shall thereafter maintain at its address specified on the signature pages hereto a copy of the written consent to such Transfer sand shall record the names and addresses of each transferee (a "Transferee") and the principal amount of each such Transfer in the Participation Register. (f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR ss.203.14, and such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law. ARTICLE 12 THE AGENT 12.1 Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Bank as its Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Agent agrees to act as such on the express conditions contained in this Article 12. Except for Section 12.10, the provisions of this Article 12 are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders and the Borrowers shall have no rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the provisions contained herein. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions which the Agent is expressly entitled to take or assert under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including (a) the determination of the applicability of ineligibility criteria with respect to the calculation of the Borrowing Base, (b) the making of Agent Advances pursuant to Section 1.2(i), and (c) the exercise of remedies pursuant to Section 9.2, and any action so taken or not taken shall be deemed consented to by the Lenders. 12.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects as long as such selection was made without gross negligence or willful misconduct. 12.3 Liability of Agent. None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by any Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of any Borrower, or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Borrower or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Borrower or any of any Borrower's Subsidiaries or Affiliates. 12.4 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or all Lenders if so required by Section 11.1) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the Lenders. 12.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless the Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender or any Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section 9; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent has received any such request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable. 12.6 Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any Borrower and its respective Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of each Borrower and its respective Affiliates, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrowers. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrowers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any Borrower which may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons. 12.7 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, from and against any and all Indemnified Liabilities as such term is defined in Section 13.11; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to the Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities resulting directly from such Agent-Related Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agent upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrowers. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Agent. 12.8 Agent in Individual Capacity. The Bank and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other business with any Borrower and its respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though the Bank were not the Agent hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Bank or its Affiliates may receive information regarding any Borrower, its respective Affiliates and Account Debtors (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Borrower or such Subsidiary) and acknowledge that the Agent and the Bank shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, the Bank shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include the Bank in its individual capacity. 12.9 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon at least 30 days' prior notice to the Lenders and the Borrowers (or to ATI on behalf of the Borrowers), such resignation to be effective upon the acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Agent. In the event the Bank sells all of its Commitment and Revolving Loans as part of a sale, transfer or other disposition by the Bank of substantially all of its loan portfolio, the Bank shall resign as Agent and such purchaser or transferee shall become the successor Agent hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, if the Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrowers, a successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article 12 shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement. 12.10 Withholding Tax. (a) If any Non-U.S. Lender claims exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or 1442 of the Code, such Non-U.S. Lender agrees with and in favor of the Agent, to deliver to the Agent and the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers): (i) if such Non-U.S. Lender claims an exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding tax under a United States of America tax treaty, properly completed IRS Forms W-8BEN and W-8ECI before the payment of any interest in the first calendar year and before the payment of any interest in each third succeeding calendar year during which interest may be paid under this Agreement; (ii) if such Non-U.S. Lender claims that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt from United States of America withholding tax because it is effectively connected with a United States of America trade or business of such Non-U.S. Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI before the payment of any interest is due in the first taxable year of such Non-U.S. Lender and in each succeeding taxable year of such Non-U.S. Lender during which interest may be paid under this Agreement, and IRS Form W-9; and (iii) such other form or forms as may be required under the Code or other laws of the United States of America as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, United States of America withholding tax. Such Non-U.S. Lender agrees to promptly notify the Agent and the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction. (b) If any Non-U.S. Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax under a United States of America tax treaty by providing IRS Form W-8BEN and such Non-U.S. Lender sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations owing to such Non-U.S. Lender (including any transfer of the Obligations to a new lending office of such Non-U.S. Lender), such Non-U.S. Lender agrees to notify the Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of the Borrowers to such Non-U.S. Lender. To the extent of such percentage amount, the Agent will treat such Non-U.S. Lender's IRS Form W-8BEN as no longer valid. (c) If any Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from United States of America withholding tax by filing IRS Form W-8ECI with the Agent sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations owing to such Non-U.S. Lender, such Non-U.S. Lender agrees to undertake sole responsibility for complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code. (d) If any Non-U.S. Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable withholding tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Non-U.S. Lender an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account such reduction. If the forms or other documentation required by subsection (a) of this Section are not delivered to the Agent, then the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Non-U.S. Lender not providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax without reduction. The Borrowers shall have no liability under Section 4.1 or otherwise with respect to amounts paid by the Agent pursuant to this Section 12.10(d). (e) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States of America or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent and/or any Borrower, as applicable did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Non-U.S. Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Non-U.S. Lender failed to notify the Agent and/or such Borrower, as applicable of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Non-U.S. Lender shall indemnify the Agent and/or such Borrower, as applicable fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent and/or such Borrower, as applicable as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Agent and/or such Borrower, as applicable under this Section, together with all costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Non-U.S. Lenders under this subsection shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Agent. 12.11 Collateral Matters. (a) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to release any Agent's Liens upon any Collateral (i) upon the termination of the Commitments and payment and satisfaction in full by Borrower of all Loans and reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit, and the termination of all outstanding Letters of Credit (whether or not any of such obligations are due) and all other Obligations; (ii) constituting property being sold or disposed of if such Borrower certifies to the Agent that the sale or disposition is made in compliance with Section 7.10 (and the Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); (iii) constituting property in which such Borrower owned no interest at the time the Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; or (iv) constituting property leased to such Borrower under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement. Except as provided above, the Agent will not release any of the Agent's Liens without the prior written authorization of the Lenders; provided that the Agent may, in its discretion, release the Agent's Liens on Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess of $5,000,000 during each Fiscal Year without the prior written authorization of the Lenders and the Agent may release the Agent's Liens on Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess of $10,000,000 during each Fiscal Year with the prior written authorization of Required Lenders. Upon request by the Agent or the Borrowers at any time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent's authority to release any Agent's Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 12.11. (b) Upon receipt by the Agent of any authorization required pursuant to Section 12.11(a) from the Lenders of the Agent's authority to release Agent's Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral, and upon at least five (5) Business Days prior written request by the Borrowers, the Agent shall (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Agent's Liens upon such Collateral; provided, however, that (i) the Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent's opinion, would expose the Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Borrowers in respect of) all interests retained by such Borrower, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. (c) The Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the Lenders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by any Borrower or is cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent's Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers granted or available to the Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, the Agent may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion given the Agent's own interest in the Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and that the Agent shall have no other duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender as to any of the foregoing. 12.12 Restrictions on Actions by Lenders; Sharing of Payments. (a) Each of the Lenders agrees that it shall not, without the express consent of the Agent and the Required Lenders, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully entitled to do so, upon the request of the Agent and the Required Lenders, set off against the Obligations, any amounts owing by such Lender to any Borrower or any accounts of any Borrower now or hereafter maintained with such Lender. Each of the Lenders further agrees that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so by the Agent, take or cause to be taken any action to enforce its rights under this Agreement or against any Borrower, including the commencement of any legal or equitable proceedings, to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security interest in, any of the Collateral. (b) If at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by payment, foreclosure, setoff or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments with respect to the Obligations of any Borrower to such Lender arising under, or relating to, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for any such proceeds or payments received by such Lender from the Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from the Agent in excess of such Lender's ratable portion of all such distributions by the Agent, such Lender shall promptly (1) turn the same over to the Agent, in kind, and with such endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Agent, or in same day funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the Lenders and for application to the Obligations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (2) purchase, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in the Obligations owed to the other Lenders so that such excess payment received shall be applied ratably as among the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided, however, that if all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases of participations shall be rescinded in whole or in part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the purchase price paid therefor shall be returned to such purchasing party, but without interest except to the extent that such purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection with the recovery of the excess payment. 12.13 Agency for Perfection. Each Lender hereby appoints the Agent and each other Lender as agent for the purpose of perfecting the Lenders' security interest in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC can be perfected only by possession. Should any Lender (other than the Agent) obtain possession of any such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Agent's request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to the Agent or in accordance with the Agent's instructions. 12.14 Payments by Agent to Lenders. All payments to be made by the Agent to the Lenders shall be made by bank wire transfer or internal transfer of immediately available funds to each Lender pursuant to wire transfer instructions delivered in writing to the Agent on or prior to the Effective Date (or if such Lender is an Assignee, on the applicable Assignment and Acceptance), or pursuant to such other wire transfer instructions as each party may designate for itself by written notice to the Agent. Concurrently with each such payment, the Agent shall identify whether such payment (or any portion thereof) represents principal, premium or interest on the Revolving Loans otherwise. Unless the Agent receives notice from any Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that such Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower has not made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid. 12.15 Settlement. (a) (i) Each Lender's funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Lenders to be equal at all times to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Revolving Loans. Notwithstanding such agreement, the Agent, the Bank, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be for the benefit of or enforceable by the Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among them as to the Revolving Loans, the Non-Ratable Loans and the Agent Advances shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the following provisions: (ii) The Agent shall request settlement ("Settlement") with the Lenders on at least a weekly basis, or on a more frequent basis at Agent's election, (A) on behalf of the Bank, with respect to each outstanding Non-Ratable Loan, (B) for itself, with respect to each Agent Advance, and (C) with respect to collections received, in each case, by notifying the Lenders of such requested Settlement by telecopy, telephone or other similar form of transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date of such requested Settlement (the "Settlement Date"). Each Lender (other than the Bank, in the case of Non-Ratable Loans and the Agent in the case of Agent Advances) shall transfer the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding principal amount of the Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances with respect to each Settlement to the Agent, to Agent's account, not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time), on the Settlement Date applicable thereto. Settlements may occur during the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default and whether or not the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 8 have then been satisfied. Such amounts made available to the Agent shall be applied against the amounts of the applicable Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance and, together with the portion of such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance representing the Bank's Pro Rata Share thereof, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders. If any such amount required hereunder to be so transferred is not transferred to the Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for the first three (3) days from and after the Settlement Date and thereafter at the Interest Rate then applicable to the Revolving Loans (A) on behalf of the Bank, with respect to each outstanding Non-Ratable Loan, and (B) for itself, with respect to each Agent Advance, but only to the extent such amount is not paid by such Borrower. (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, not more than one (1) Business Day after demand is made by the Agent (whether before or after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default and regardless of whether the Agent has requested a Settlement with respect to a Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance), each other Lender (A) shall irrevocably and unconditionally purchase and receive from the Bank or the Agent, as applicable, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation in such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance and (B) if Settlement has not previously occurred with respect to such Non-Ratable Loans or Agent Advances, upon demand by Bank or Agent, as applicable, shall pay to Bank or Agent, as applicable, as the purchase price of such participation an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loans or Agent Advances. If such amount is not in fact made available to the Agent by any Lender, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for the first three (3) days from and after such demand and thereafter at the Interest Rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans, but only to the extent such amount is not paid by such Borrower. (iv) From and after the date, if any, on which any Lender purchases an undivided interest and participation in any Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Agent shall promptly distribute to such Lender, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of all payments of principal and interest and all proceeds of Collateral received by the Agent in respect of such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance. (v) Between Settlement Dates, the Agent, to the extent no Agent Advances are outstanding, may pay over to the Bank any payments received by the Agent, which in accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to the Bank's Revolving Loans including Non-Ratable Loans. If, as of any Settlement Date, collections received since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied to the Bank's Revolving Loans (other than to Non-Ratable Loans or Agent Advances in which such Lender has not yet funded its purchase of a participation pursuant to clause (iii) above), as provided for in the previous sentence, the Bank shall pay to the Agent for the accounts of the Lenders, to be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lenders, an amount such that each Lender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. During the period between Settlement Dates, the Bank with respect to Non-Ratable Loans, the Agent with respect to Agent Advances, and each Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the actual average daily amount of funds employed by the Bank, the Agent and the other Lenders. (vi) Unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender to the contrary, the Agent may assume that the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 8 have been satisfied and the requested Borrowing will not exceed Availability on any Funding Date for a Revolving Loan or Non-Ratable Loan. (b) Lenders' Failure to Perform. All Revolving Loans (other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances) shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, and (iii) the obligations of each Lender hereunder shall be several, not joint and several. (c) Defaulting Lenders. Unless the Agent receives notice from a Lender on or prior to the Effective Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the Effective Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to the Agent that Lender's Pro Rata Share of a Borrowing, the Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date. Furthermore, the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If any Lender has not transferred, on the date required hereunder, its full Pro Rata Share of any required funding to the Agent in immediately available funds and the Agent has transferred the corresponding amount to a Borrower, such Lender, on the Business Day following such date, shall make such amount available to the Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for that day. A notice by the Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If a Lender's full Pro Rata Share is transferred to the Agent as required, the amount transferred to the Agent shall constitute that Lender's Revolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. If that amount is not transferred to the Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, the Agent will notify the applicable Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Agent, such Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent for the Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans comprising that particular Borrowing. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan on any Funding Date (any such Lender, prior to the cure of such failure, being hereinafter referred to as a "Defaulting Lender") shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make a Revolving Loan on that Funding Date. No Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to advance such other Lenders' Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing. (d) Retention of Defaulting Lender's Payments. The Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by any Borrower to the Agent for the Defaulting Lender's benefit; nor shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder. Amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender shall instead be paid to or retained by the Agent. In its discretion, the Agent may loan any Borrower the amount of all such payments received or retained by it for the account of such Defaulting Lender. Any amounts so loaned to any Borrower shall bear interest at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans and for all other purposes of this Agreement shall be treated as if they were Revolving Loans, provided, however, that for purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents and determining Pro Rata Shares, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender". Until a Defaulting Lender cures its failure to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing (A) such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to any portion of the Unused Line Fee and (B) the Unused Line Fee shall accrue in favor of the Lenders which have funded their respective Pro Rata Shares of such requested Borrowing and shall be allocated among such performing Lenders ratably based upon their relative Commitments. This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Lender until such time as the Defaulting Lender shall no longer be in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement. The terms of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, or relieve or excuse the performance by any Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder. 12.16 Letters of Credit; Intra-Lender Issues. (a) Notice of Letter of Credit Balance. On each Settlement Date the Agent shall notify each Lender of the issuance of all Letters of Credit since the prior Settlement Date. (b) Participations in Letters of Credit. (i) Purchase of Participations. Immediately upon issuance of any Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 1.4(d), each Lender shall be deemed to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the face amount of such Letter of Credit (including all obligations of the applicable Borrower with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto). (ii) Sharing of Reimbursement Obligation Payments. Whenever the Agent receives a payment from a Borrower on account of reimbursement obligations in respect of a Letter of Credit as to which the Agent has previously received for the account of a Letter of Credit Issuer thereof payment from a Lender, the Agent shall promptly pay to such Lender such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such payment from such Borrower. Each such payment shall be made by the Agent on the next Settlement Date. (iii) Documentation. Upon the request of any Lender, the Agent shall, to the extent delivered to the Agent by the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer, furnish to such Lender copies of any Letter of Credit, reimbursement agreements executed in connection therewith, applications for any Letter of Credit, and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Lender. (iv) Obligations Irrevocable. The obligations of each Lender to make payments to the Agent with respect to any Letter of Credit or with respect to their participation therein or with respect to the Revolving Loans made as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit and the obligations of any Borrower for whose account the Letter of Credit was issued to make payments to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, shall be irrevocable and shall not be subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever, including any of the following circumstances: (1) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents; (2) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which such Borrower may have at any time against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), any Lender, the Agent, the issuer of such Letter of Credit, or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transactions between such Borrower or any other Person and the beneficiary named in any Letter of Credit); (3) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; (4) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents; (5) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; or (6) the failure of such Borrower to satisfy the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 8. (c) Recovery or Avoidance of Payments; Refund of Payments In Error. In the event any payment by or on behalf of a Borrower received by the Agent with respect to any Letter of Credit and distributed by the Agent to the Lenders on account of their respective participations therein is thereafter set aside, avoided or recovered from the Agent in connection with any receivership, liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, the Lenders shall, upon demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent their respective Pro Rata Shares of such amount set aside, avoided or recovered, together with interest at the rate required to be paid by the Agent upon the amount required to be repaid by it. Unless the Agent receives notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that such Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower has not made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid. (d) Indemnification by Lenders. To the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder, the Lenders agree to indemnify the Letter of Credit Issuer ratably in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees) or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Letter of Credit Issuer in any way relating to or arising out of any Letter of Credit or the transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document in connection therewith; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent it arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Letter of Credit Issuer to be indemnified. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or expenses payable by any Borrower to the Letter of Credit Issuer, to the extent that the Letter of Credit Issuer is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by such Borrower. The agreement contained in this Section shall survive payment in full of all other Obligations. 12.17 Concerning the Collateral and the Related Loan Documents. Each Lender authorizes and directs the Agent to enter into the other Loan Documents, for the ratable benefit and obligation of the Agent and the Lenders. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Agent or the Required Lenders, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Agent or the Required Lenders, as applicable, of their respective powers set forth therein or herein, together with such other powers that are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be binding upon all of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that the Revolving Loans, reimbursement obligations under Letters of Credit, Agent Advances, Non-Ratable Loans, Bank Products and all interest, fees and expenses hereunder constitute one Debt, secured pari passu by all of the Collateral. 12.18 Field Audit and Examination Reports; Disclaimer by Lenders. By signing this Agreement, each Lender: (a) is deemed to have requested that the Agent furnish such Lender, promptly after it becomes available, a copy of each field audit or examination report (each a "Report" and collectively, "Reports") prepared by or on behalf of the Agent; (b) expressly agrees and acknowledges that neither the Bank nor the Agent (i) makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report, or (ii) shall be liable for any information contained in any Report; (c) expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not comprehensive audits or examinations, that the Agent or the Bank or other party performing any audit or examination will inspect only specific information regarding the Borrowers and will rely significantly upon the Borrowers' books and records, as well as on representations of the Borrowers' personnel; and (d) without limiting the generality of any other indemnification provision contained in this Agreement, agrees: (i) to hold the Agent and any such other Lender preparing a Report harmless from any action the indemnifying Lender may take or conclusion the indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any Report in connection with any loans or other credit accommodations that the indemnifying Lender has made or may make to the Borrowers, or the indemnifying Lender's participation in, or the indemnifying Lender's purchase of, a loan or loans of any Borrower; and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and hold the Agent and any such other Lender preparing a Report harmless from and against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses and other amounts (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent and any such other Lender preparing a Report as the direct or indirect result of any third parties who might obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender. 12.19 Relation Among Lenders. The Lenders are not partners or co-venturers, and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as otherwise set forth herein in case of the Agent) authorized to act for, any other Lender. 12.20 Co-Agents. None of the Lenders identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement as a "syndication agent" or a "documentation agent" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders so identified as a "co-agent" or a "documentation agent" shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. ARTICLE 13 GUARANTEES 13.1 Guaranty. Each Borrower hereby jointly and severally, unconditionally, continually and irrevocably guarantees to the Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers, the full and prompt payment when due, whether at maturity or earlier, by reason of acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, of all of the Obligations, whether or not from time to time reduced or extinguished or hereafter increased or incurred, whether or not recovery may be or hereafter may become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether enforceable or unenforceable as against any other Borrower, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due (all such indebtedness, liabilities and obligations being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations") This Section 13.1 continues, reaffirms and amends, as the case may be, the guarantees under the Original Subsidiary Agreements and the Restated Subsidiary Guaranty. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of each Borrower individually with respect to its Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law. 13.2 Contribution. The Borrowers hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Borrower shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Borrower shall have a right of contribution from each other Borrower in an amount equal to such other Borrower's Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The payment obligations of any Borrower under this paragraph shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Guaranteed Obligations until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full and all Commitments have been terminated, and none of the Borrowers shall exercise any right or remedy under this paragraph against any other Borrower until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full and all Commitments have been terminated. For purposes of this paragraph, (a) "Excess Payment" shall mean the amount paid by any Borrower in excess of its Pro Rata Guaranty Share of any Guaranteed Obligations; (b) "Pro Rata Guaranty Share" shall mean, for any Borrower in respect of any payment of Obligations by such Borrower, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such payment of Guaranteed Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Borrower (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Borrower hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of all of the Borrowers exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder) of the Borrowers; provided, however, that, for purpose of calculating the Pro Rata Guaranty Shares of the Borrowers in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, any Borrower that became a Borrower subsequent to the date of any such payment shall be deemed to have been a Borrower on the date of such payment and the financial information for such Borrower as of the date such Borrower became a Borrower shall be utilized for such Borrower in connection with such payment; and (c) "Contribution Share" shall mean, for any Borrower in respect of any Excess Payment made by any other Borrower, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Borrower (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Borrower hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of the Borrowers other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder) of the Borrowers other than the maker of such Excess Payment; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of the Borrowers in respect of any Excess Payment, any Borrower that became a Borrower subsequent to the date of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to have been a Borrower on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial information for such Borrower as of the date such Borrower became a Borrower shall be utilized for such Borrower in connection with such Excess Payment. 13.3 Waivers; Other Agreements. (i) Subject to the terms hereof, the Agent is hereby authorized by the Borrowers (subject to any additional authorization required by the Lenders or the Required Lenders), without notice to or demand upon any Borrower, which notice or demand is expressly waived hereby, and without discharging or otherwise affecting the obligations of any Borrower hereunder (which shall remain absolute and unconditional notwithstanding any such action or omission to act), from time to time, to: (A) supplement, renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or other terms relating to, the Guaranteed Obligations, or otherwise modify, amend or change the terms of any promissory note or other agreement, document or instrument (including this Agreement and the other Loan Documents) now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to the Agent, including, without limitation, any increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon; (B) waive or otherwise consent to noncompliance with any provision of any instrument evidencing the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, or any other instrument or agreement in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations (including this Agreement and the other Loan Documents) now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to the Agent; (C) accept partial payments on the Guaranteed Obligations; (D) receive, take and hold additional security or collateral for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or for the payment of any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations or other liabilities of any Borrower, and exchange, enforce, waive, substitute, liquidate, terminate, abandon, fail to perfect, subordinate, transfer, otherwise alter and release any such additional security or collateral; (E) apply any and all such security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Agent may determine in its sole discretion; (F) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Guaranteed Obligations or accept, substitute, release, exchange or otherwise alter, affect or impair any security or collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty therefor, in any manner; (G) add, release or substitute any one or more other guarantors, makers or endorsers of the Guaranteed Obligations and otherwise enforce its rights under the Loan Documents against any Borrower or any other guarantor, maker or endorser as the Agent may elect in its sole discretion; (H) apply any and all payments or recoveries from any Borrower, from any other guarantor, maker or endorser of the Guaranteed Obligations to the Obligations in such order as provided in Section 3.8 hereof, whether such Guaranteed Obligations are secured or unsecured or guaranteed or not guaranteed by others; (I) apply any and all payments or recoveries from any Borrower or any other guarantor, maker or endorser of the Guaranteed Obligations or sums realized from security furnished by any of them upon any of their indebtedness or obligations to the Agent as the Agent in its sole discretion, may determine, whether or not such indebtedness or obligations relate to the Guaranteed Obligations; and (J) refund at any time, at the Agent's sole discretion, any payment received by the Agent in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, and payment to the Agent of the amount so refunded shall be fully guaranteed hereby even though prior thereto this Agreement shall have been cancelled or surrendered (or any release or termination of any collateral by virtue thereof) by the Agent, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of any Borrower hereunder in respect of the amount so refunded (and any collateral so released or terminated shall be reinstated with respect to such obligations); even if any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of any Borrower is extinguished, affected or impaired by any of the foregoing (including, without limitation, any election of remedies by reason of any judicial, non-judicial or other proceeding in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations which impairs any subrogation, reimbursement or other right of such Borrower). The foregoing provisions are intended to eliminate suretyship defenses and are not intended to affect the operation of Section 11.1. (ii) Each Borrower hereby waives: (A) any requirements of diligence or promptness on the part of the Agent; (B) presentment, demand for payment or performance and protest and notice of protest with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (C) notices (I) of nonperformance, (II) of acceptance of this Agreement, (III) of default in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, (IV) of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional indebtedness, arising either from additional loans extended to any Borrower or otherwise, (V) that the principal amount, or any portion thereof, and/or any interest on any instrument or document evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations is due, (VI) of any and all proceedings to collect from any Borrower, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or from anyone else, and (VII) of exchange, sale, surrender or other handling of any security or collateral given to the Agent to secure payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any guaranty therefor; (D) any right to require the Agent to (I) proceed first against any other Borrower, or any other person whatsoever, (II) proceed against or exhaust any security given to or held by the Agent in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or (III) pursue any other remedy in the Agent's power whatsoever; (E) any defense arising by reason of (I) any disability or other defense of any Borrower, (II) the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of any Borrower, (III) any act or omission of the Agent or others which directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, results in or aids the discharge or release of any Borrower or any security given to or held by the Agent in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations; (F) any and all other suretyship defenses under applicable law; (G) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Guaranteed Obligations or such Borrower's liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof. (H) in connection with the foregoing, each Borrower covenants that this Agreement shall not be discharged, except by complete performance of the obligations contained herein. (iii) Each Borrower hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of each other Borrower, of any and all endorsers and/or other guarantors of any instrument or document evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof that diligent inquiry would reveal and each Borrower hereby agrees that the Agent shall not have any duty to advise any Borrower of information known to the Agent regarding such condition or any such circumstances. (iv) Each Borrower hereby agrees that any indebtedness of any Borrower now or hereafter owing to such Borrower is hereby subordinated to all of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether heretofore, now or hereafter created (the "Subordinated Debt"), and that without the prior consent of the Agent, the Subordinated Debt shall not be paid in whole or in part until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, the commitments of the Lenders to extend credit under the Credit Agreement have been terminated, no Letters of Credit are outstanding and the Credit Agreement has been terminated and is of no further force or effect, except that payments of principal and interest on the Subordinated Debt shall be permitted so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing to the extent such payments would not render such Borrower incapable of performing the Guaranteed Obligations. No Borrower will accept any payment of or on account of any Subordinated Debt at any time in contravention of the foregoing. At the request of the Agent, each Borrower shall pay to the Agent all or any part of the Subordinated Debt and any amount so paid to the Agent shall be applied to payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each payment on the Subordinated Debt received in violation of any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed to have been received by the relevant Borrower as trustee for the Agent and shall be paid over to the Agent immediately on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without otherwise affecting in any manner such Borrower's liability under any of the provisions of this Agreement. Each Borrower agrees to file all claims against any other Borrower in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in respect of any Subordinated Debt, and the Agent shall be entitled to all of such Borrower's right thereunder. If for any reason the relevant Borrower fails to file such claim at least thirty (30) days prior to the last date on which such claim should be filed, the Agent, as such Borrower's attorney-in-fact, is hereby authorized to do so in such Borrower's name or, in the Agent's discretion, to assign such claim to and cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of the Agent or its nominee. In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person or persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to the Agent the full amount payable on the claim in the proceeding, and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, each Borrower hereby assigns to the Agent all such Borrower's rights to any payments or distributions to which such Borrower otherwise would be entitled. If the amount so paid is greater than such Borrower's liability hereunder, the Agent will pay the excess amount to the party entitled thereto. In addition, each Borrower hereby appoints the Agent as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all of such Borrower's voting rights in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding or any plan for the reorganization of any other Borrower. 13.4 Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Borrower hereby expressly agrees that this Article 13 is a continuing, unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and its obligations under this Article 13 are joint and several, absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged or otherwise affected as a result of: (i) the invalidity or unenforceability of any security for or other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any promissory note or other document (including, without limitation, this Agreement) evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or failure of priority of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty therefor; (ii) the absence of any attempt to collect the Guaranteed Obligations from any other Borrower or any other guarantor or other action to enforce the same; (iii) failure by the Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty therefor; (iv) the Agent's election, in any proceeding instituted under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (11 U.S.C. ss. 101 et seq.) (the "Bankruptcy Code"), of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (v) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by any Borrower, as debtor-in-possession, or extension of credit, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; (vi) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of the Agent's claim(s) for repayment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) any use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code; (viii) any agreement or stipulation as to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy proceeding; (ix) the avoidance of any lien in favor of the Agent for any reason; (x) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or dissolution proceeding commenced by or against any Borrower or any other guarantor, maker or endorser, including without limitation, any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations (or any interest thereon) in or as a result of any such proceeding; (xi) failure by the Agent to file or enforce a claim against any Borrower or its estate in any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding; (xii) any action taken by the Agent that is authorized by this Agreement; (xiii) any election by the Agent under Section 9-501(4) of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in any relevant jurisdiction as to any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (xiv) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. 13.5 Reinstatement. Each Borrower further agrees that, if any payment made by any Borrower or any other person and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations is at any time annulled, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of any Collateral are required to be returned by the Agent, any of the Lenders and any Issuing Bank to any Borrower, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, including, without limitation, any guarantor, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, each Borrower's liability hereunder (and any lien, security interest or other collateral securing such liability) shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made, or, if prior thereto this Agreement shall have been cancelled or surrendered (and if any lien, security interest or other collateral securing any Borrower's liability hereunder shall have been released or terminated by virtue of such cancellation or surrender), this Agreement (and such lien, security interest or other collateral) shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of any Borrower in respect of the amount of such payment (or any lien, security interest or other collateral securing such obligation). 13.6 Payment. (i) Each Borrower agrees that if any other Borrower shall default in payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether principal, interest, premium, fee (including, but not limited to, loan fees and attorneys' fees and expenses), or otherwise, when and as the same shall become due, and after expiration of any applicable grace period, whether according to the terms of this Agreement, by acceleration, or otherwise, or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, then such Borrower will, upon demand thereof by the Agent, fully pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank equal to all the Guaranteed Obligations then due and owing. (ii) Each Borrower further agrees to pay all costs and expenses upon demand including, without limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses paid or incurred by the Agent (i) in endeavoring to collect all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations after the same become due and owing from, or in prosecuting any action against, any Borrower or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or (ii) in endeavoring to realize upon (whether by judicial, non-judicial or other proceedings) any Collateral or any other collateral securing any Guarantor's liabilities under this Agreement. ARTICLE 14 MISCELLANEOUS 14.1 No Waivers; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by the Agent or any Lender to exercise any right, remedy, or option under this Agreement or any present or future supplement thereto, or in any other agreement between or among any Borrower and the Agent and/or any Lender, or delay by the Agent or any Lender in exercising the same, will operate as a waiver thereof. No waiver by the Agent or any Lender will be effective unless it is in writing, and then only to the extent specifically stated. No waiver by the Agent or the Lenders on any occasion shall affect or diminish the Agent's and each Lender's rights thereafter to require strict performance by any Borrower of any provision of this Agreement. The Agent and the Lenders may proceed directly to collect the Obligations without any prior recourse to the Collateral. The Agent's and each Lender's rights under this Agreement will be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy which the Agent or any Lender may have. 14.2 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement or any Loan Document or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder. 14.3 Governing Law; Choice of Forum; Service of Process.

No notice to or demand on any Borrower which the Agent or any Lender may elect to give shall entitle any Borrower to any or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. 14.10 Binding Effect. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective representatives, successors, and assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, that no interest herein may be assigned by any Borrower without prior written consent of the Agent and each Lender.

The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other Obligations. (b) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from any loss or liability directly or indirectly arising out of the use, generation, manufacture, production, storage, release, threatened release, discharge, disposal or presence of a hazardous substance relating to any Borrower's operations, business or property. This indemnity will apply whether the hazardous substance is on, under or about such Borrower's property or operations or property leased to such Borrower. The indemnity includes but is not limited to Attorneys Costs. "Hazardous substances" means any substance, material or waste that is or becomes designated or regulated as "toxic," "hazardous," "pollutant," or "contaminant" or a similar designation or regulation under any federal, state or local law (whether under common law, statute, regulation or otherwise) or judicial or administrative interpretation of such, including petroleum or natural gas. This indemnity will survive repayment of all other Obligations. 14.12 Limitation of Liability. NO CLAIM MAY BE MADE BY ANY PARTY HERETO AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR THE AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, COUNSEL, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS OR ATTORNEYS-IN-FACT OF ANY SUCH PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN RESPECT OF ANY CLAIM FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY ACT, OMISSION OR EVENT OCCURRING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, AND EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES AND AGREES NOT TO SUE UPON ANY CLAIM FOR SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER OR NOT ACCRUED AND WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO EXIST IN ITS FAVOR. 14.13 Final Agreement. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are intended by the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders to be the final, complete, and exclusive expression of the agreement between them. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior oral or written agreements relating to the subject matter hereof except for the Fee Letter. No modification, rescission, waiver, release, or amendment of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made, except by a written agreement signed by the Borrowers and a duly authorized officer of each of the Agent and the requisite Lenders. 14.14 Counterparts.

The captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, are without substantive meaning and should not be construed to modify, enlarge, or restrict any provision. 14.16 Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been accelerated, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrowers, any such notice being waived by the Borrowers to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrowers (or ATI on behalf of the Borrowers) and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO LENDER SHALL EXERCISE ANY RIGHT OF SET-OFF, BANKER'S LIEN, OR THE LIKE AGAINST ANY DEPOSIT ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY OF ANY BORROWER HELD OR MAINTAINED BY SUCH LENDER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE AGENT AND THE REQUIRED LENDERS. 14.17 Confidentiality.

(b) Each Lender and the Agent severally agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified as "confidential" or "secret" by any Borrower and provided to the Agent or such Lender by or on behalf of such Borrower, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including any Report provided by the Agent to any Lender), except to the extent that such information (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by the Agent or such Lender, or (ii) was or becomes available on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than any Borrower, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with any Borrower or an Affiliate thereof known to the Agent or such Lender; provided, however, that the Agent and any Lender may disclose such information (1) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority to which the Agent or such Lender is subject or in connection with an examination of the Agent or such Lender by any such Governmental Authority; (2) pursuant to subpoena or other court process; (3) when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (4) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any litigation or proceeding (including, but not limited to, any bankruptcy proceeding) to which the Agent, any Lender or their respective Affiliates may be party; (5) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (6) to the Agent's or such Lender's independent auditors, accountants, attorneys and other professional advisors; (7) to any prospective Participant or Assignee under any Assignment and Acceptance, actual or potential, provided that such prospective Participant or Assignee agrees to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder; (8) as expressly permitted under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding confidentiality to which any Borrower is party or is deemed party with the Agent or such Lender, and (9) to its Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the information subject to this Section 14.17(b) shall not include, and the Borrowers, Agent and each Lender and the respective Affiliates of each of the foregoing (and the respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and other representatives of each of the foregoing and their Affiliates) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, (a) any information with respect to the U.S. federal and state income tax treatment of the transactions contemplated hereby and any facts that may be relevant to understanding such tax treatment, which facts shall not include for this purpose the names of the parties or such other Persons, or any pricing terms or other nonpublic business or financial information that is unrelated to such tax treatment or facts and (b) all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Agent or such Lender relating to such tax treatment or facts. 14.18 Conflicts with Other Loan Documents. Unless otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (or in another Loan Document by specific reference to the applicable provision contained in this Agreement), if any provision contained in this Agreement conflicts with any provision of any other Loan Document, the provision contained in this Agreement shall govern and control. 14.19 No Lender Reliance on Margin Stock. Each Lender acknowledges and represents that it, in good faith, has not relied upon Margin Stock of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as collateral in its decision to make any Credit Extensions to the Borrowers. ARTICLE 15 AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT 15.1 Amendment and Restatement. Each Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereby agree that upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, the terms and provisions of the Original Credit Agreement which in any manner govern or evidence the Obligations, the rights and interests of the Lenders and any terms, conditions or matters related to any thereof, shall be and hereby are amended and restated in their entirety by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Original Credit Agreement shall be superseded by this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein. Notwithstanding the amendment and restatement of Original Credit Agreement and certain of the related "Loan Documents" as defined in the Original Credit Agreement (the "Prior Loan Documents") by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as herein defined, all of the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations owing by any Borrower under the Original Credit Agreement shall continue as Obligations hereunder and shall be and remain secured by the Security Instruments for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders. This Agreement is given as a substitution of, and not as a payment of, the indebtedness, liabilities and obligations of the Borrowers, under the Original Credit Agreement and is not intended to constitute a novation thereof or of any of the other Prior Loan Documents. Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, all Loans owing by the Borrowers and Letters of Credit outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement shall continue as Loans and Letters of Credit hereunder, in each case accruing interest, as of the date hereof, at the Base Rate hereunder. 15.2 Assignment and Acceptance. Each Borrower, the Agent, the Letter of Credit Issuers and the Lenders hereby acknowledge the assignment by the lenders party to the Original Credit Agreement to the Lenders party hereto of all Loans and Commitments under the Original Credit Agreement in the amounts and allocations as reflected on Schedule 1.1 substantially simultaneously with the effectiveness of this Agreement and such assignment shall be deemed to have been consummated in accordance with Section 12.01 of the Original Credit Agreement and the terms, conditions, representations and warranties set forth in the form of Assignment and Acceptance set forth as Exhibit 12.01 of the Original Credit Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and agreed to as between the lenders party to the Original Credit Agreement and Lender party hereto as if an Assignment and Acceptance had been fully executed and delivered by such parties.

Each Grantor agrees to furnish any such information to the Agent promptly upon request. Each Grantor also ratifies its authorization for the Agent to have filed in any Uniform Commercial Code jurisdiction any like initial financing statements or amendments thereto if filed prior to the date hereof. (h) Each Grantor shall promptly notify Agent of any commercial tort claim (as defined in the UCC) acquired by it and unless otherwise consented by Agent, such Grantor shall enter into a supplement to this Security Agreement, granting to Agent a Lien in such commercial tort claim. (i) From time to time, each Grantor shall, upon the Agent's request, execute and deliver confirmatory written instruments pledging to the Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, the Collateral, but such Grantor's failure to do so shall not affect or limit any security interest or any other rights of the Agent or any Lender in and to the Collateral with respect to such Grantor. So long as the Credit Agreement is in effect and until all Obligations have been fully satisfied, the Agent's Liens shall continue in full force and effect in all Collateral (whether or not deemed eligible for the purpose of calculating the Availability or as the basis for any advance, loan, extension of credit, or other financial accommodation).

(a) Each Grantor represents and warrants to the Agent and the Lenders and agrees with the Agent and the Lenders that all of the Inventory owned by such Grantor is and will be held for sale or lease, or to be furnished in connection with the rendition of services, in the ordinary course of such Grantor's business, and is and will be fit for such purposes. Each Grantor will keep its Inventory in good and marketable condition, except for damaged or defective goods arising in the ordinary course of such Grantor's business. No Grantor will, without the prior written consent of the Agent, acquire or accept any Inventory on consignment or approval.

[Intentionally omitted]. 15. PLEDGED COLLATERAL. (a) The Pledged Equity Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. The Pledged Notes of any Grantor's Subsidiaries (if any), and, to the best of each Grantor's knowledge, all other Pledged Notes, have been duly authorized, issued and delivered, and is the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the issuers thereof. (b) The Pledged Equity Interests indicated on Schedule IV hereto constitute all of the shares of stock held by each Grantor of the respective issuers thereof who are not Foreign Subsidiaries and constitute 65% of all of the shares of stock of the respective issuers who are Foreign Subsidiaries. The Pledged Equity Interests and the Pledged Notes constitute all of the Pledged Collateral except for Pledged Collateral consisting of checks and drafts received in the ordinary course of business and with respect to which the Agent has not at any time requested possession and which are not a material portion of the Collateral under this Security Agreement (the "Personal Property Collateral"), either singly or in the aggregate. (c) The pledge and delivery of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to this Security Agreement and all other filings and other actions taken by each Grantor to perfect such security interest prior to the date hereof, create a continuing, valid and perfected first priority security interest in the Pledged Collateral, securing the payment of the Obligations except for Pledged Collateral consisting of checks and drafts received in the ordinary course of business with respect to which the Agent has not at any time requested possession and which are not a material portion of the Personal Property Collateral, either singly or in the aggregate. (d) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing: (i) Each Grantor, and not the Agent, shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other rights of consent or approval pertaining to the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof for any purpose not inconsistent with the terms of this Security Agreement or the Credit Agreement; provided, however, that no Grantor shall exercise or refrain from exercising any such right without the consent of the Agent if such action or inaction would have a material adverse effect on the benefits to the Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, including, without limitation, the validity, priority or perfection of the security interest granted hereby or the remedies of the Agent hereunder. (ii) Each Grantor, and not the Agent, shall be entitled to receive and retain any and all dividends and interest paid in respect of the Pledged Collateral; provided, however, that any and all (A) dividends and interest paid or payable other than in cash in respect of, and instruments and other property received, receivable or otherwise distributed in respect of, or in exchange for, any Pledged Collateral, (B) dividends and other distributions paid or payable in cash in respect of any Pledged Collateral consisting of stock or other equity interest of any Subsidiary of any Grantor and dividends and other distributions paid or payable in cash in respect of any other Pledged Collateral in connection with a partial or total liquidation or dissolution or in connection with a reduction of capital, capital-surplus or paid-in-surplus, and (C) cash paid, payable or otherwise distributed in respect of principal of, or in redemption of, or in exchange for, any Pledged Collateral, shall forthwith be delivered to the Agent, in the case of (A) above, to hold as Pledged Collateral and shall, if received by any Grantor, be received in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, be segregated from the other property or funds of such Grantor, and be forthwith delivered to the Agent, as Pledged Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement) and, in the case of (B) and (C) above, shall forthwith be delivered to the Agent to be applied to the Obligations in such order as provided in Section 3.8 of the Credit Agreement. (iii) The Agent shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to each Grantor all such proxies and other instruments as such Grantor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such Grantor to exercise the voting and other rights which it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (i) above and to receive the dividends or interest payments which it is authorized to receive and retain pursuant to paragraph (ii) above. (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and at the direction of the Required Lenders: (i) All rights of any Grantor to exercise the voting and other rights of consent or approval which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 15(d)(i) hereof and to receive the dividends and interest payments which it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to Section 15(d)(ii) hereof shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in the Agent, who shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting and other rights of consent or approval and to receive and hold as Pledged Collateral such dividends and interest payments. (ii) All dividends and interest payments which are received by any Grantor contrary to the provisions of paragraph (ii) of Section 15(d) hereof shall be received in trust for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks and shall be segregated from other funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to the Agent as Pledged Collateral in the same form as so received (with any necessary indorsement). (f) Each Grantor agrees that it will (i) cause each issuer of the Pledged Equity Interests subject to its control not to issue any stock or other securities in addition to or in substitution for the Pledged Shares issued by such issuer, except to such Grantor or as otherwise permitted under the Credit Agreement, and (ii) pledge hereunder, immediately upon its acquisition (directly or indirectly) thereof, any and all additional shares of stock or other securities of each issuer of the Pledged Equity Interests; provided that in no event shall any Grantor be required to pledge more than 65% of the shares of any Foreign Subsidiary. Each Grantor hereby authorizes the Agent to modify this Security Agreement by amending Annex IV to include such additional shares or other securities. (g) Determination by the Agent to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Collateral pursuant to Section 24 hereof without making a request of the relevant Grantor to register such Pledged Collateral under the Securities Act shall not by the sole fact of such sale be deemed to be commercially unreasonable. (h) The Grantors hereby agree that the aggregate principal amount of all promissory notes described in clause (i) of the definition of Excluded Notes at any time outstanding shall not exceed $3,000,000. 16. Documents, Instruments, and Chattel Paper.

If any Grantor retains possession of any Chattel Paper or Instruments with Agent's consent, such Chattel Paper and Instruments shall be marked with the following legend: "This writing and the obligations evidenced or served hereby are subject to the security interest of Bank of America, N.A., as Agent, for the benefit of Agent and certain Lenders." 17. Right to Cure. The Agent may, in its reasonable discretion, and shall, at the direction of the Required Lenders, pay any amount or do any act reasonably required of any Grantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document in order to preserve, protect, maintain or enforce the Obligations, the Collateral or the Agent's Liens therein, and which such Grantor fails to pay or do, including payment of any judgment against such Grantor, any insurance premium, any warehouse charge, any finishing or processing charge, any landlord's or bailee's claim, and any other Lien upon or with respect to the Collateral. All payments that the Agent makes under this Section 17 and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses that the Agent pays or incurs in connection with any action taken by it hereunder shall be charged to the Borrower's Loan Account as a Revolving Loan. Any payment made or other action taken by the Agent under this Section 17 shall be without prejudice to any right to assert an Event of Default hereunder and to proceed thereafter as herein provided. 18. Power of Attorney. Each Grantor hereby appoints the Agent and the Agent's designee as each Grantor's attorney, with power: (a) to endorse such Grantor's name on any checks, notes, acceptances, money orders, or other forms of payment or security that come into the Agent's or any Lender's possession; (b) to sign such Grantor's name on any invoice, bill of lading, warehouse receipt or other negotiable or non-negotiable Document constituting Collateral, on drafts against customers, on assignments of Accounts, on notices of assignment, financing statements and other public records and to file any such financing statements by electronic means with or without a signature as authorized or required by applicable law or filing procedure; (c) so long as any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing to notify the post office authorities to change the address for delivery of such Grantor's mail to an address designated by the Agent and to receive, open and dispose of all mail addressed to such Grantor; (d) to send requests for verification of Accounts to customers or Account Debtors; (e) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to complete in such Grantor's name or the Agent's name, any order, sale or transaction, obtain the necessary Documents in connection therewith, and collect the proceeds thereof; (f) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to clear Inventory through customs in such Grantor's name, the Agent's name or the name of the Agent's designee, and to sign and deliver to customs officials powers of attorney in such Grantor's name for such purpose; (g) to the extent such Grantor's authorization given in Section 3(g) of this Security Agreement is not sufficient, to file such financing statements with respect to this Security Agreement, with or without such Grantor's signature, or to file a photocopy of this Security Agreement in substitution for a financing statement, as the Agent may deem appropriate and to execute in such Grantor's name such financing statements and amendments thereto and continuation statements which may require such Grantor's signature; (h) to receive, indorse and collect all instruments made payable to such Grantor representing any dividend, interest payment or other distribution in respect of the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for the same; and (i) to do all things necessary to carry out the Credit Agreement and this Security Agreement. Each Grantor ratifies and approves all acts of such attorney. None of the Lenders or the Agent nor their attorneys will be liable for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law except for their willful misconduct. This power, being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable until the Credit Agreement has been terminated and the Obligations have been fully satisfied. 19. The Agent's and Lenders' Rights, Duties and Liabilities. (a) Each Grantor assumes all responsibility and liability arising from or relating to the use, sale, license or other disposition of the Collateral. The Obligations shall not be affected by any failure of the Agent or any Lender to take any steps to perfect the Agent's Liens or to collect or realize upon the Collateral, nor shall loss of or damage to the Collateral release any Grantor from any of the Obligations. Following the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Agent may (but shall not be required to), and at the direction of the Required Lenders shall, without notice to or consent from any Grantor, sue upon or otherwise collect, extend the time for payment of, modify or amend the terms of, compromise or settle for cash, credit, or otherwise upon any terms, grant other indulgences, extensions, renewals, compositions, or releases, and take or omit to take any other action with respect to the Collateral, any security therefor, any agreement relating thereto, any insurance applicable thereto, or any Person liable directly or indirectly in connection with any of the foregoing, without discharging or otherwise affecting the liability of any Grantor for the Obligations or under the Credit Agreement or any other agreement now or hereafter existing between the Agent and/or any Lender and any Grantor. (b) It is expressly agreed by each Grantor that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under each of its contracts and each of its licenses to observe and perform all the conditions and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation or liability under any contract or license by reason of or arising out of this Security Agreement or the granting herein of a Lien thereon or the receipt by Agent or any Lender of any payment relating to any contract or license pursuant hereto. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall be required or obligated in any manner to perform or fulfill any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any contract or license, or to make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or the sufficiency of any performance by any party under any contract or license, or to present or file any claims, or to take any action to collect or enforce any performance or the payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times. (c) Agent may at any time after an Event of Default has occurred and be continuing (or if any rights of set-off (other than set-offs against an Account arising under the contract giving rise to the same Account) or contra accounts may be asserted with respect to the following), without prior notice to any Grantor, notify Account Debtors, and other Persons obligated on the Collateral that Agent has a security interest therein, and that payments shall be made directly to Agent, for itself and the benefit of Lenders. Upon the request of Agent, each Grantor shall so notify Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on Collateral. Once any such notice has been given to any Account Debtor or other Person obligated on the Collateral, such Grantor shall not give any contrary instructions to such Account Debtor or other Person without Agent's prior written consent. (d) Agent may at any time in Agent's own name or in the name of any Grantor communicate with Account Debtors, parties to Contracts and obligors in respect of Instruments to verify with such Persons, to Agent's reasonable satisfaction, the existence, amount and terms of Accounts, payment intangibles, Instruments or Chattel Paper. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Grantor, at its own expense, shall cause the independent certified public accountants then engaged by such Grantor to prepare and deliver to Agent and each Lender at any time and from time to time promptly upon Agent's request the following reports with respect to such Grantor: (i) a reconciliation of all Accounts; (ii) an aging of all Accounts; (iii) trial balances; and (iv) a test verification of such Accounts as Agent may request. Each Grantor, at its own expense, shall deliver to Agent the results of each physical verification, if any, which such Grantor may in its discretion have made, or caused any other Person to have made on its behalf, of all or any portion of its Inventory. 20. PATENT, TRADEMARK AND COPYRIGHT COLLATERAL. (a) No Grantor has any interest in, or title to, any Trademark, Copyright or material Patent except as set forth in Schedule III hereto. This Security Agreement is effective to create a valid and continuing Lien on and, upon filing of the Trademark Security Agreement with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, perfected Liens in favor of Agent on such Grantor's patents, trademarks and copyrights and such perfected Liens are enforceable as such as against any and all creditors of and purchasers from such Grantor. Upon filing of the Trademark Security Agreement with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the filing of appropriate financing statements, all action necessary or desirable to protect and perfect Agent's Lien on such Grantor's patents, trademarks or copyrights shall have been duly taken. (b) Each Grantor shall notify Agent immediately if it knows that any application or registration relating to any patent, trademark or copyright (now or hereafter existing) may become abandoned or dedicated, or of any adverse determination or development (including the institution of, or any such determination or development in, any proceeding in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any court) regarding such Grantor's ownership of any such patent, trademark or copyright, its right to register the same, or to keep and maintain the same. (c) In no event shall any Grantor, either directly or through any agent, employee, licensee or designee, file an application for the registration of any patent, trademark or copyright with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any similar office or agency without giving Agent written notice thereof, and, upon request of Agent, Grantor shall execute and deliver any and all patent security agreements, copyright security agreements or trademark security agreements as Agent may request to evidence Agent's Lien on such patent, trademark or copyright, and the General Intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby. (d) Each Grantor shall take all actions appropriate under the circumstances or reasonably requested by Agent to maintain and pursue each patent, trademark and copyright application currently pending, to obtain the relevant registration and to maintain the registration of each of the patents, trademarks and copyrights (now or hereafter existing), including the filing of applications for renewal, affidavits of use, affidavits of noncontestability and opposition and interference and cancellation proceedings, unless such Grantor shall determine in its reasonable business judgment that such patent, trademark or copyright is not material to the conduct of its business. (e) In the event that any of the patent, trademark or copyright Collateral is infringed upon, or misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such Grantor shall notify Agent promptly after such Grantor learns of such infringement. Each Grantor shall, unless it shall reasonably determine that such patent, trademark or copyright Collateral is not material to the conduct of its business or operations, promptly take appropriate action to protect such patent, copyright or trademark, including, where such Grantor believes in its reasonable business judgment that it would be prudent to do so, sue for infringement, misappropriation or dilution and to recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution, and shall take such other actions as Agent shall reasonably request under the circumstances to protect such patent, trademark or copyright Collateral. 21. INDEMNIFICATION. In any suit, proceeding or action brought by Agent or any Lender relating to any Collateral for any sum owing with respect thereto or to enforce any rights or claims with respect thereto, each Grantor will save, indemnify and keep Agent and Lenders harmless from and against all expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), loss or damage suffered by reason of any defense, setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or reduction of liability whatsoever of the Account Debtor or other Person obligated on the Collateral, arising out of a breach by any Grantor of any obligation thereunder or arising out of any other agreement, indebtedness or liability at any time owing to, or in favor of, such obligor or its successors from such Grantor, except in the case of Agent or any Lender, to the extent such expense, loss, or damage is attributable solely to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or such Lender as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. All such obligations of any Grantor shall be and remain enforceable against and only against such Grantor and shall not be enforceable against Agent or any Lender. 22. LIMITATION ON LIENS ON COLLATERAL. No Grantor will create, permit or suffer to exist, and will defend the Collateral against, and take such other action as is necessary to remove, any Lien on the Collateral except Liens permitted by Section 7.10(b) of the Credit Agreement, and will defend the right, title and interest of Agent and Lenders in and to any of such Grantor's rights under the Collateral against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. 23. NOTICE REGARDING COLLATERAL. Each Grantor will advise Agent promptly, in reasonable detail of any Lien (other than Liens permitted by Section 7.10(b) of the Credit Agreement) or claim made or asserted against any of the Collateral. 24. REMEDIES; RIGHTS UPON DEFAULT. (a) In addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it under this Security Agreement, the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and under any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to any of the Obligations, if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Agent may exercise all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor expressly agrees that in any such event Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement or notice of any kind (except the notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements and notices are hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the UCC and other applicable law), may forthwith enter upon the premises of such Grantor where any Collateral is located through self-help, without judicial process, without first obtaining a final judgment or giving such Grantor or any other Person notice and opportunity for a hearing on Agent's claim or action and may collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and may forthwith sell, lease, license, assign, give an option or options to purchase, or sell or otherwise dispose of and deliver said Collateral (or contract to do so), or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at a public or private sale or sales, at any exchange at such prices as it may deem acceptable, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. Agent or any Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, the whole or any part of said Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption, which equity of redemption such Grantor hereby releases. Such sales may be adjourned and continued from time to time with or without notice. Agent shall have the right to conduct such sales on any Grantor's premises or elsewhere and shall have the right to use any Grantor's premises without charge for such time or times as Agent deems necessary or advisable. The Agent is authorized, at any such sale, if it deems it advisable so to do, to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers of any of the Pledged Collateral to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale of any such Pledged Collateral, and to take such other actions as it may deem appropriate to exempt the offer and sale of the Collateral from any registration requirements of state or federal securities laws (including, if it deems it appropriate, actions to comply with Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to time amended (the "Securities Act")). (b) Each Grantor further agrees, at Agent's request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Agent at a place or places designated by Agent which are reasonably convenient to Agent and such Grantor, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere. Until Agent is able to effect a sale, lease, or other disposition of Collateral, Agent shall have the right to hold or use Collateral, or any part thereof, to the extent that it deems appropriate for the purpose of preserving Collateral or its value or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by Agent. Agent shall have no obligation to any Grantor to maintain or preserve the rights of such Grantor as against third parties with respect to Collateral while Collateral is in the possession of Agent. Agent may, if it so elects, seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to take possession of Collateral and to enforce any of Agent's remedies (for the benefit of Agent and Lenders), with respect to such appointment without prior notice or hearing as to such appointment. Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any such collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation, realization or sale to the Obligations as provided in the Credit Agreement, and only after so paying over such net proceeds, and after the payment by Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, need Agent account for the surplus, if any, to such Grantor. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages, and demands against Agent or any Lender arising out of the repossession, retention or sale of the Collateral except such as arise solely out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or such Lender as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each Grantor agrees that ten (10) days prior notice by Agent of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may take place is reasonable notification of such matters. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations, including any attorneys' fees or other expenses incurred by Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency. (c) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each Grantor hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or any notice (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection with this Security Agreement or any Collateral. (d) To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the Agent to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that it is commercially reasonable for the Agent (a) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by the Agent to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (b) to fail to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (c) to fail to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse claims against Collateral, (d) to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (e) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (f) to contact other Persons, whether or not in the same business as such Grantor, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral, (g) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (h) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (i) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, (j) to disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession or quiet enjoyment, (k) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure the Agent against risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (l) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist the Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. Each Grantor acknowledges that the purpose of this Section 24(d) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Agent would not be commercially unreasonable in the Agent's exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this Section 24(d). Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 24(d) shall be construed to grant any rights to any Grantor or to impose any duties on Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Security Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this Section 24(d). 25. GRANT OF LICENSE TO USE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. For the purpose of enabling Agent to exercise rights and remedies under Section 24 hereof (including, without limiting the terms of Section 24 hereof, in order to take possession of, hold, preserve, process, assemble, prepare for sale, market for sale, sell or otherwise dispose of Collateral) at such time as Agent shall be lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to Agent, wherever permitted by law or by agreement, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, an irrevocable, nonexclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to such Grantor) to use, license or sublicense any Intellectual Property now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, and wherever the same may be located, and including in such license access to all media in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all computer software and programs used for the compilation or printout thereof. 26. LIMITATION ON AGENT'S AND LENDERS' DUTY IN RESPECT OF COLLATERAL. Agent and each Lender shall use reasonable care with respect to the Collateral in its possession or under its control. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall have any other duty as to any Collateral in its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or nominee of Agent or such Lender, or any income thereon or as to the preservation of rights against prior parties or any other rights pertaining thereto. 27. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) Reinstatement. This Security Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by or against any Grantor for liquidation or reorganization, should such Grantor become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of any creditor or creditors or should a receiver or trustee be appointed for all or any significant part of such Grantor's assets, and shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and performance of the Obligations, or any part thereof, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by any obligee of the Obligations, whether as a "voidable preference," "fraudulent conveyance," or otherwise, all as though such payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored or returned, the Obligations shall be reinstated and deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced, restored or returned. (b) Notices. Except as otherwise provided herein, whenever it is provided herein that any notice, demand, request, consent, approval, declaration or other communication shall or may be given to or served upon any of the parties by any other party, or whenever any of the parties desires to give and serve upon any other party any communication with respect to this Security Agreement, each such notice, demand, request, consent, approval, declaration or other communication shall be in writing and shall be given in the manner, and deemed received, as provided for in the Credit Agreement. (c) Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Security Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Security Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Security Agreement. This Security Agreement is to be read, construed and applied together with the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents which, taken together, set forth the complete understanding and agreement of Agent, Lenders and Grantor with respect to the matters referred to herein and therein. (d) No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. Neither Agent nor any Lender shall by any act, delay, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder, and no waiver shall be valid unless in writing, signed by Agent and then only to the extent therein set forth. A waiver by Agent of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy which Agent would otherwise have had on any future occasion. No failure to exercise nor any delay in exercising on the part of Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies hereunder provided are cumulative and may be exercised singly or concurrently, and are not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided by law. None of the terms or provisions of this Security Agreement may be waived, altered, modified or amended except by an instrument in writing, duly executed by Agent and each Grantor. (e) Limitation by Law. All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Security Agreement may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable provision of law, and all the provisions of this Security Agreement are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law that may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they shall not render this Security Agreement invalid, unenforceable, in whole or in part, or not entitled to be recorded, registered or filed under the provisions of any applicable law. (f) Termination of this Security Agreement. (a) Subject to Section 27(a) hereof, this Security Agreement shall terminate upon all Letters of Credit being Fully Supported, the payment in full of all other Obligations (other than indemnification Obligations as to which no claim has been asserted) and the termination of all Commitments under the Credit Agreement. (b) Upon any sale or other transfer by a Grantor of any Collateral that is permitted under the Credit Agreement to any Person that is not a Grantor, or, upon the effectiveness of any written consent to the release of the security interest granted hereby in any Collateral pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the security interest in such Collateral shall automatically be released. (c) The Agent agrees that upon such termination or release of the security interests or release of any Collateral, the Agent shall, at the expense of the Grantors, execute and deliver to each Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence the termination of the security interests or the release and reassignment of such Collateral, as the case may be. (g) Successors and Assigns. This Security Agreement and all obligations of each Grantor hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each Grantor (including any debtor-in-possession on behalf of such Grantor) and shall, together with the rights and remedies of Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, hereunder, inure to the benefit of Agent and Lenders, all future holders of any instrument evidencing any of the Obligations and their respective successors and assigns. No sales of participations, other sales, assignments, transfers or other dispositions of any agreement governing or instrument evidencing the Obligations or any portion thereof or interest therein shall in any manner affect the Lien granted to Agent, for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, hereunder. No Grantor may assign, sell, hypothecate or otherwise transfer any interest in or obligation under this Security Agreement. (h) Counterparts. This Security Agreement may be authenticated in any number of separate counterparts, each of which shall collectively and separately constitute one and the same agreement. This Security Agreement may be authenticated by manual signature, facsimile or, if approved in writing by Agent, electronic means, all of which shall be equally valid. (i) Governing Law. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, IN ALL RESPECTS, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE, THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT AND THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS MADE AND PERFORMED IN THAT STATE, AND ANY APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GRANTOR HEREBY CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY, CITY OF NEW YORK, SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION TO HEAR AND DETERMINE ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN ANY GRANTOR, AGENT AND LENDERS PERTAINING TO THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR TO ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, PROVIDED, THAT AGENT, LENDERS AND EACH GRANTOR ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY APPEALS FROM THOSE COURTS MAY HAVE TO BE HEARD BY A COURT LOCATED OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK COUNTY, CITY OF NEW YORK, AND, PROVIDED, FURTHER, NOTHING IN THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED OR OPERATE TO PRECLUDE AGENT FROM BRINGING SUIT OR TAKING OTHER LEGAL ACTION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION TO REALIZE ON THE COLLATERAL OR ANY OTHER SECURITY FOR THE OBLIGATIONS, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF AGENT. EACH GRANTOR EXPRESSLY SUBMITS AND CONSENTS IN ADVANCE TO SUCH JURISDICTION IN ANY ACTION OR SUIT COMMENCED IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND EACH GRANTOR HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE BASED UPON LACK OF PERSONAL JURISDICTION, IMPROPER VENUE OR FORUM NON CONVENIENS AND HEREBY CONSENTS TO THE GRANTING OF SUCH LEGAL OR EQUITABLE RELIEF AS IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY SUCH COURT. EACH GRANTOR HEREBY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF THE SUMMONS, COMPLAINT AND OTHER PROCESS ISSUED IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR SUIT AND AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUCH SUMMONS, COMPLAINTS AND OTHER PROCESS MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL ADDRESSED TO SUCH GRANTOR AT THE ADDRESS SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.8 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THAT SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED COMPLETED UPON THE EARLIER OF ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF OR THREE (3) DAYS AFTER DEPOSIT IN THE U.S. MAILS, PROPER POSTAGE PREPAID. (j) Waiver of Jury Trial. BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH COMPLEX FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES DESIRE THAT DISPUTES ARISING HEREUNDER OR RELATING HERETO BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS. THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND OF ARBITRATION, THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, AMONG AGENT, LENDERS, AND ANY GRANTOR ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO. (k) Section Titles. The Section titles contained in this Security Agreement are and shall be without substantive meaning or content of any kind whatsoever and are not a part of the agreement between the parties hereto. (l) No Strict Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Security Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Security Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Security Agreement. (m) Advice of Counsel. Each of the parties represents to each other party hereto that it has discussed this Security Agreement and, specifically, the provisions of Section 27(i) and Section 27(j), with its counsel. (n) Benefit of Lenders. All Liens granted or contemplated hereby shall be for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, and all proceeds or payments realized from Collateral in accordance herewith shall be applied to the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused this Security Agreement to be executed and delivered by its duly authorized officer as of the date first set forth above. ANNTAYLOR, INC.

Exhibit 10.3 SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED PARENT GUARANTY THIS SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED PARENT GUARANTY (as such agreement may be amended, supplemented, modified or amended and restated from time to time, this "Guaranty") dated as of November 14, 2003 is made by ANNTAYLOR STORES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 142 West 57th Street, New York, New York 10019 (the "Guarantor"), in favor of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent for each of the Lenders now or hereafter party to the Credit Agreement (as defined below) (the "Agent"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement (as defined below). R E C I T A L S: WHEREAS, ATI, the Agent, the lenders referred to therein, the syndication agents named therein and the issuing banks named therein have entered into that certain $150,000,000 Credit Agreement dated June 30, 1998 (as amended, the "Original Credit Agreement"), as amended and restated pursuant to the terms of that certain $175,000,000 Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 30, 2001 (as amended, the "Restated Credit Agreement"); and WHEREAS, at the Borrowers' request, the Lenders, the Agent, and the syndication and documentation agents party thereto, have agreed to amend and restate the Restated Credit Agreement in its entirety as of the date hereof (as so amended and restated and as such agreement may be further amended, supplemented, modified, or amended and restated from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"); and WHEREAS, the Guarantor is the parent of the Borrowers and has and will materially benefit from the Loans made and to be made, and the Letters of Credit issued and to be issued, under the Credit Agreement; and WHEREAS, the Guarantor and the Agent have entered into that certain ATSC Guaranty dated June 30, 1998 (as amended, the "Original Guaranty") pursuant to which the Guarantor has guaranteed the full and prompt payment and performance of the ATI's Obligations under the Original Credit Agreement, as amended and restated pursuant to the terms of that certain Amended and Restated ATSC Guaranty, dated April 30, 2001 (as amended, the "Restated Guaranty"). NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises and in order to induce the Lenders and each Letter of Credit Issuer to amend and restate the Restated Credit Agreement and continue to, respectively, make Loans and issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the Guarantor hereby agrees, and the Agent for its benefit, and for the benefit of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, by acceptance hereof, hereby agrees as follows: 1. Guaranty. (a) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally, continually and irrevocably guarantees to the Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers, the full and prompt payment when due, whether at maturity or earlier, by reason of acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents, of all of the Obligations, whether or not from time to time reduced or extinguished or hereafter increased or incurred, whether or not recovery may be or hereafter may become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether enforceable or unenforceable as against the Borrowers, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due (all such indebtedness, liabilities and obligations being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations"). For purposes of this Guaranty, any Affiliate of any Lender, which is a party to a Hedge Agreement or Foreign Currency Exchange Contract with any Borrower or any of its respective Restricted Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a "Lender". This Section 1 continues, reaffirms and amends, as the case may be, the guarantees under the Original Guaranty and the Restated Guaranty. (b) The Guarantor further agrees that, if any payment made by any Borrower or any other person and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations is at any time annulled, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of Collateral are required to be returned by any of the Lenders or any of the Letter of Credit Issuers to any Borrower, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, including, without limitation, the Guarantor, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Guarantor's liability hereunder (and any lien, security interest or other collateral securing such liability) shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made, or, if prior thereto this Guaranty shall have been cancelled or surrendered (and if any lien, security interest or other collateral securing Guarantor's liability hereunder shall have been released or terminated by virtue of such cancellation or surrender), this Guaranty (and such lien, security interest or other collateral) shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the Guarantor in respect of the amount of such payment (or any lien, security interest or other collateral securing such obligation). (c) The Guarantor further agrees to pay all costs and expenses upon demand including, without limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses (including the allocated cost of in-house counsel) paid or incurred by the Agent (i) in endeavoring to collect all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations after the same become due and owing from, or in prosecuting any action against, the Guarantor or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or (ii) in endeavoring to realize upon (whether by judicial, non-judicial or other proceedings) any Collateral or any other collateral securing Guarantor's liabilities under this Guaranty. 2. Payment. The Guarantor agrees that if any Borrower shall default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether with respect to principal, interest, premium, fee (including, but not limited to, loan fees and attorneys' fees and expenses), or otherwise, when and as the same shall become due, and after expiration of any applicable grace period, whether according to the terms of the Credit Agreement, by acceleration, or otherwise, or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, then the Guarantor will, upon demand thereof by the Agent, fully pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuer, an amount equal to all the Guaranteed Obligations then due and owing. 3. Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Agent that each representation and warranty made by Borrowers in Article 6 of the Credit Agreement applicable to the Guarantor is true and correct, which representations and warranties (except such representations and warranties which are expressly made as of a different date) shall survive the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, and shall, except to the extent that the same have been modified by a writing delivered to and accepted in writing by the Agent, and, other than with respect to changes permitted or contemplated by the Credit Agreement, continue to be true and correct on the date of each Loan, and on the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit. 4. Waivers; Other Agreements. (a) The Agent is hereby authorized, without notice to or demand upon the Guarantor, which notice or demand is expressly waived hereby, and without discharging or otherwise affecting the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder (which shall remain absolute and unconditional notwithstanding any such action or omission to act), from time to time, to: (i) supplement, renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or other terms relating to, the Guaranteed Obligations, or otherwise modify, amend, restate or change the terms of any promissory note or other agreement, document or instrument (including the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents) now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to the Agent, including, without limitation, any increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon; (ii) waive or otherwise consent to noncompliance with any provision of any instrument evidencing the Guaranteed Obligations, or any part thereof, or any other instrument or agreement in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations (including the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents) now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to the Agent; (iii) accept partial payments on the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) receive, take and hold additional security or collateral for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or for the payment of any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations or other liabilities of any Borrower, and exchange, enforce, waive, substitute, liquidate, terminate, abandon, fail to perfect, subordinate, transfer, otherwise alter and release any such additional security or collateral; (v) apply any and all such security or collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Agent may determine in its sole discretion; (vi) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Guaranteed Obligations or accept, substitute, release, exchange or otherwise alter, affect or impair any security or collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty therefor, in any manner; (vii) add, release or substitute any one or more other guarantors, makers or endorsers of the Guaranteed Obligations and otherwise enforce its rights under the Loan Agreements against any Borrower or any other guarantor, maker or endorser as the Agent may elect in its sole discretion; (viii) apply any and all payments or recoveries from the Borrower, from any other guarantor, maker or endorser of the Guaranteed Obligations or from the Guarantor to the Guaranteed Obligations to the Obligations in such order as provided in Section 3.8 of the Credit Agreement, whether such Guaranteed Obligations are secured or unsecured or guaranteed or not guaranteed by others; (ix) apply any and all payments or recoveries from the Guarantor or any other guarantor, maker or endorser of the Guaranteed Obligations or sums realized from security furnished by any of them upon any of their indebtedness or obligations to the Agent as the Agent in its sole discretion, may determine, whether or not such indebtedness or obligations relate to the Guaranteed Obligations; and (x) refund at any time, at the Agent's sole discretion, any payment received by the Agent in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, and payment to the Agent of the amount so refunded shall be fully guaranteed hereby even though prior thereto this Guaranty shall have been cancelled or surrendered (or any release or termination of any collateral by virtue thereof) by the Agent, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder in respect of the amount so refunded (and any collateral so released or terminated shall be reinstated with respect to such obligations); even if any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantor is extinguished, affected or impaired by any of the foregoing (including, without limitation, any election of remedies by reason of any judicial, non-judicial or other proceeding in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations which impairs any subrogation, reimbursement or other right of Guarantor). (b) The Guarantor hereby agrees that this Guaranty is a continuing, unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection and that its obligations under this Guaranty are primary, absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged or otherwise affected as a result of: (i) the invalidity or unenforceability of any security for or other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any promissory note or other document (including, without limitation, the Credit Agreement) evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or failure of priority of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty therefor; (ii) the absence of any attempt to collect the Guaranteed Obligations from the Borrower or any other guarantor or other action to enforce the same; (iii) failure by the Agent to take any steps to perfect and maintain any security interest in, or to preserve any rights to, any security or collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty therefor; (iv) the Agent's election, in any proceeding instituted under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (11 U.S.C. ss. 101 et seq.) (the "Bankruptcy Code"), of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (v) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by the Borrower, as debtor-in-possession, or extension of credit, under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; (vi) the disallowance, under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, of all or any portion of the Agent's claim(s) for repayment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vii) any use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code; (viii) any agreement or stipulation as to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy proceeding; (ix) the avoidance of any lien in favor of the Agent for any reason; (x) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or dissolution proceeding commenced by or against any Borrower, the Guarantor or any other guarantor, maker or endorser, including without limitation, any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations (or any interest thereon) in or as a result of any such proceeding; (xi) failure by the Agent to file or enforce a claim against the Borrower or its estate in any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding; (xii) any action taken by the Agent that is authorized by this Guaranty; (xiii) any election by the Agent under Section 9-501(4) of the Uniform Commercial Code, or any successor provision, as enacted in any relevant jurisdiction (the "Code") as to any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (xiv) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. (c) The Guarantor hereby waives: (i) any requirements of diligence or promptness on the part of the Agent; (ii) presentment, demand for payment or performance and protest and notice of protest with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) notices (A) of nonperformance, (B) of acceptance of this Guaranty, (C) of default in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, (D) of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional indebtedness, arising either from additional loans extended to any Borrower or otherwise, (E) that the principal amount, or any portion thereof, and/or any interest on any instrument or document evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations is due, (F) of any and all proceedings to collect from any Borrower, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or from anyone else, and (G) of exchange, sale, surrender or other handling of any security or collateral given to the Agent to secure payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any guaranty therefor; (iv) any right to require the Agent to (a) proceed first against any Borrower, or any other person whatsoever, (b) proceed against or exhaust any security given to or held by the Agent in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or (c) pursue any other remedy in the Agent's power whatsoever; (v) any defense arising by reason of (a) any disability or other defense of any Borrower, (b) the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of any Borrower, (c) any act or omission of the Agent or others which directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, results in or aids the discharge or release of any Borrower or any security given to or held by the Agent in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) any and all other suretyship defenses under applicable law; and (vii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Guaranteed Obligations or the Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof. In connection with the foregoing, the Guarantor covenants that this Guaranty shall not be discharged, except by complete performance of the obligations contained herein. (d) The Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Borrowers, of any and all endorsers and/or other guarantors of any instrument or document evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof that diligent inquiry would reveal and the Guarantor hereby agrees that the Agent shall not have any duty to advise the Guarantor of information known to the Agent regarding such condition or any such circumstances. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Guaranty, the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives all rights which may have arisen in connection with this Guaranty to be subrogated to any of the rights (whether contractual, under the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 509 thereof, under common law or otherwise) of the Agent, the Lenders or the Letter Credit of Issuers against any Borrower or against any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by such Person for the payment of the Obligations. The Guarantor hereby further irrevocably waives all contractual, common law, statutory or other rights of reimbursement, contribution, exoneration or indemnity (or any similar right) from or against any Borrower or any other Person, which may have arisen in connection with this Guaranty. So long as the Obligations remain outstanding, if any amount shall be paid by or on behalf of any Borrower to the Guarantor on account of any of the rights waived in this paragraph, such amount shall be held by the Guarantor in trust, segregated from other funds of such Guarantor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to the Agent in the exact form received by the Guarantor (duly indorsed by the Guarantor to the Agent, if required), to be applied against the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in such order as the Agent may determine. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the term of this Guaranty and the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of the commitments of the Lenders to extend credit under the Credit Agreement , the termination or expiration of all Letters of Credit or the full and irrevocable cash collateralization thereof and the termination of the Credit Agreement. (f) The Guarantor hereby agrees that any indebtedness of any Borrower now or hereafter owing to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to all of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether heretofore, now or hereafter created (the "Subordinated Debt"), and that without the prior consent of the Agent, the Subordinated Debt shall not be paid in whole or in part until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, the commitments of the Lenders to extend credit under the Credit Agreement have been terminated, no Letters of Credit exist that have not been Fully Supported, and the Credit Agreement has been terminated and is of no further force or effect, except that payments of (i) principal on the Subordinated Debt shall be permitted so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing to the extent such payments would not render such Borrower incapable of performing the Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) interest on the Subordinated Debt shall be permitted so long as no notice of Event of Default shall have been delivered to ATI or any other Borrower by the Agent or any Lender. The Guarantor will not accept any payment of or on account of any Subordinated Debt at any time in contravention of the foregoing. At the request of the Agent, the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Agent all or any part of the Subordinated Debt and any amount so paid to the Agent shall be applied to payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each payment on the Subordinated Debt received in violation of any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed to have been received by Guarantor as trustee for the Agent and shall be paid over to the Agent immediately on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without otherwise affecting in any manner the Guarantor's liability under any of the provisions of this Guaranty. The Guarantor agrees to file all claims against the applicable Borrower in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in respect of any Subordinated Debt, and the Agent shall be entitled to all of the Guarantor's right thereunder. If for any reason the Guarantor fails to file such claim at least thirty (30) days prior to the last date on which such claim should be filed, the Agent, as the Guarantor's attorney-in-fact, is hereby authorized to do so in the Guarantor's name or, in the Agent's discretion, to assign such claim to and cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of the Agent or its nominee. In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person or persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to the Agent the full amount payable on the claim in the proceeding, and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, the Guarantor hereby assigns to the Agent all Guarantor's rights to any payments or distributions to which the Guarantor otherwise would be entitled. If the amount so paid is greater than the Guarantor's liability hereunder, the Agent will pay the excess amount to the party entitled thereto. In addition, the Guarantor hereby appoints Agent as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all of the Guarantor's voting rights in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding or any plan for the reorganization of such Borrower. (g) The Guarantor shall comply with all covenants applicable to it under the Credit Agreement and shall otherwise take no action which will cause a Default or Event of Default under the Credit Agreement. The Guarantor shall also cause each Borrower to comply with all covenants applicable to such Borrower under the Credit Agreement. (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Guaranty or any other Loan Document, the Guarantor shall not (a) conduct, transact or otherwise engage in, or commit to conduct, transact or otherwise engage in, any business or operations other than those incidental to its ownership of the equity Securities of the Borrowers, (b) incur, create, assume or suffer to exist any Indebtedness or other liabilities or financial obligations, except (i) nonconsensual obligations imposed by operation of law, (ii) pursuant to the Loan Documents to which it is a party, (iii) obligations with respect to its Securities or (c) own, lease, manage or otherwise operate any properties or assets (including cash (other than cash received in connection with Restricted Payments made by any Borrower in accordance with the Credit Agreement pending application in the manner contemplated by the Credit Agreement) and cash equivalents) other than (i) the ownership of shares of equity Securities of the Borrowers, (ii) the ownership of one share of capital stock of AnnTaylor Sourcing Far East Limited, and (iii) ownership of the Convertible Debentures Note; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Guarantor may from time to time conduct activities directly related to the business of the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries that the Borrowers and/or their Subsidiaries would be permitted to conduct at such time under the applicable provisions of the Credit Agreement so long as, prior to commencing any such activity, the Agent shall, by written consent (which may only be requested hereunder when no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), have reasonably determined that such activity or its consequences could not reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the interests of the Lenders or the Borrowers and their Subsidiaries. 5. Default, Remedies. (a) The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are independent of and separate from the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations. If any of the Guaranteed Obligations are not paid when due, or upon any Event of Default or any default by any Borrower as provided in any other instrument or document evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once, without notice, against the Guarantor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations, without first proceeding against any Borrower or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any Collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations under the Security Agreement or otherwise against any Collateral under other Collateral Documents. (b) At any time after maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Agent may, without notice to the Guarantor and regardless of the acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and apply toward the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations (i) any indebtedness due or to become due from the Agent to the Guarantor and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to the Guarantor at any time held by or coming into the possession of the Agent or any of its affiliates. (c) The Guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers the Agent, in its sole discretion, without any notice (except notices required by law to the extent such notice as a matter of law may not be waived) or demand to the Guarantor whatsoever and without affecting the liability of the Guarantor hereunder, to exercise any right or remedy which the Agent may have available to it, including but not limited to, foreclosure by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, and the Guarantor hereby waives any defense to the recovery by the Agent against the Guarantor of any deficiency after such action, notwithstanding any impairment or loss of any right of reimbursement, contribution, subrogation or other right or remedy against any Borrower, or any other guarantor, maker or endorser, or against any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for any guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations. No exercise by the Agent of, and no omission of the Agent to exercise, any power or authority recognized herein and no impairment or suspension of any right or remedy of the Agent against the Guarantor, any other guarantor, maker or endorser or any security shall in any way suspend, discharge, release, exonerate or otherwise affect any of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder or give to the Guarantor any right of recourse against the Agent, the Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuers. (d) The Guarantor consents and agrees that the Agent shall not be under any obligation to make any demand upon or pursue or exhaust any of its rights or remedies against any Borrower or any guarantor or others with respect to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or to pursue or exhaust any of its rights or remedies with respect to any security therefor, or any direct or indirect guaranty thereof or any security for any such guaranty, or to marshal any assets in favor of the Guarantor or against or in payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations or to resort to any security or any such guaranty in any particular order, and all of its rights hereunder, under the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents shall be cumulative. The Guarantor hereby agrees to waive, and does hereby absolutely and irrevocably waive and relinquish the benefit and advantage of, and does hereby covenant not to assert against the Agent any valuation, stay, appraisal, extension or redemption laws now existing or which may hereafter exist which, but for this provision, might be applicable to any sale made under the judgment, order or decree of any court, or privately under the power of sale conferred by this Guaranty or the Security Instruments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor hereby agrees that it will not invoke or utilize any law which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the rights under this Guaranty, the Security Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. 6. Miscellaneous. (a) This Guaranty shall be irrevocable as to any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations until the Credit Agreement has been terminated, the commitments of the Lenders to extend credit under the Credit Agreement have been terminated and all Guaranteed Obligations then outstanding have been repaid. (b) This Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor and upon its successors and assigns, heirs and legal representatives and shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers; all references herein to the Borrowers and to the Guarantor shall be deemed to include their successors and assigns, heirs and legal representatives as applicable. Each Borrower's successors and assigns shall include a receiver, trustee or debtor-in-possession of or for such Borrower. All references to the singular shall be deemed to include the plural where the context so requires. The Guarantor acknowledges the Agent's acceptance hereof and reliance hereon. (c) No delay on the part of the Agent in the exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Agent of any right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise thereof; nor shall any modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Guaranty be binding upon the Agent, except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered by the Agent or on the Agent's behalf by an authorized officer or agent of the Agent. The Agent's failure at any time or times hereafter to require strict performance by any Borrower or of the Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the provisions, warranties, terms and conditions contained in any promissory note, security agreement, agreement, guaranty, instrument or document now or at any time or times hereafter executed by any Borrower or the Guarantor or any other guarantor and delivered to the Agent shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of the Agent at any time or times hereafter to demand strict performance thereof and such right shall not be deemed to have been waived by any act or knowledge of the Agent, its agents, officers or employees, unless such waiver is contained in an instrument in writing signed by an officer or agent of the Agent and directed to the Borrowers or the Guarantor, or any of them (as the case may be) specifying such waiver. No waiver by the Agent of any default shall operate as a waiver of any other default or the same default on a future occasion, and no action by the Agent permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair the Agent's rights or the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty. Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the amount of any principal and/or interest owing by the Borrowers to the Agent shall be conclusive and binding on the Guarantor irrespective of whether it was a party to the suit or action in which such determination was made. (d) THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ALL RESPECTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Whenever possible, each provision of this Guaranty shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Guaranty. (e) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HERETO CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS.

(f) EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS UPON IT AND CONSENTS THAT ALL SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED MAIL (RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED) DIRECTED TO SUCH PARTY AT ITS ADDRESS SPECIFIED ON THE FIRST PAGE HEREOF OR SET FORTH IN SECTION 14.8 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE COMPLETED FIVE (5) DAYS AFTER THE SAME SHALL HAVE BEEN SO DEPOSITED IN THE U.S. MAILS POSTAGE PREPAID. NOTHING CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF AGENT OR THE LENDERS TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS BY ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. (g) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS GUARANTY, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON, PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF OR THEREOF. THIS WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS GUARANTY AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.

(k) Wherever possible each provision of this Guaranty shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be prohibited by or invalid under such law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Guaranty.

All regions produced strong positive comparable sales performance.

"At Ann Taylor selling across our giftable areas, including cashmere sweaters, fashion accessories and outerwear was strong. Additionally, we were especially pleased with selling in our refined separates category." Mr. Spainhour continued, "At Ann Taylor Loft we continue to be excited about the positive performance across the business. December marked the fourth consecutive month of double-digit comparable store sales for the division. Every category exceeded our expectations. Our gift-giving focus on tops, outerwear and accessories drove outstanding full price results." Total inventory levels at the end of December, including inventory attributable to Ann Taylor Global Sourcing, were down approximately 18 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year, consistent across both divisions. For the second time this quarter, based on stronger than expected sales performance, the Company is raising fourth quarter earnings expectations to the range of $0.54 - $0.56 from the range of $0.43 - $0.45. The Company continues to expect comparable store sales for January in the range of positive 3 - 5 percent, for both divisions. The Company did not open or close any stores during fiscal December. The total store count at fiscal month end remained at 652, comprised of 357 Ann Taylor stores, 268 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 27 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total store square footage at the end of fiscal December increased 11 percent over last year. For the fiscal year-to-date period ended January 3, 2004, the Company's net sales totaled $1,494,592,000, up 15.1 percent from $1,299,063,000 for the same ================================================================================

Exhibit 99.1 Ann Taylor News Release 142 West 57th Street New York N.Y. 10019 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES JANUARY SALES RESULTS, RAISES FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS -------------------------------------------------------------------------- GUIDANCE AND PROVIDES FISCAL YEAR 2004 GUIDANCE ----------------------------------------------- New York, New York, February 5, 2004 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ------------------------------------ ANN) announced today that total net sales for the four week period ended January 31, 2004 increased 13.7 percent to $93,116,000, from total net sales of $81,903,000 for the four week period ended February 1, 2003. By division, net sales were $50,392,000 for Ann Taylor and $36,346,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the period increased 3.7 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 10.3 percent for the same four week period last year. By division, comparable store sales were down 1.5 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 9.6 percent decrease last year, and up 16.1 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 12.2 percent decrease last year. For the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2004, the Company's net sales totaled $448,677,000, up 27.4 percent from $352,213,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. By division, net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were $243,414,000 for Ann Taylor and $171,847,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the quarter increased 15.5 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 12.3 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. By division, comparable store sales were up 14.4 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a decrease of 14.6 percent last year and up 20.0 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 7.1 percent decrease last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "We expect to report record earnings performance for the fourth quarter, and are once again raising earnings per share guidance to the range of $0.63 - $0.65, up from $0.54 - $0.56. The improvement in earnings is based on better gross margin performance on January sales, and the favorable gross margin effect of our year end physical inventory. Full year earnings per share on a diluted basis is expected to be in the range of $2.11 - $2.13, which represents the Company's second straight year of record earnings performance." Mr. Spainhour continued, "Overall, we were pleased with our January business, and are entering February in a very clean inventory position. Sales at Ann Taylor Loft continued to exceed expectations, with the fifth consecutive month of double-digit comparable store sales growth. Fashion, novelty and compelling value drove strong full price selling overall, particularly in tops, separates and fashion accessories. At Ann Taylor, January comparable store sales were down slightly, however we were pleased with the full price sales momentum that began building in week 4 as February merchandise became available in stores." Total inventory levels at the end of January were down approximately 16 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. This follows an approximate 18 percent decrease in inventory levels on a per square foot basis at the end of fiscal December. While full price inventory levels at the end of January were flat to last year on a per square foot basis, strong Holiday and post-Holiday sales, particularly at Ann Taylor Loft, resulted in much lower levels of markdown inventory, which drove the decrease in total inventory on a per square foot basis. For the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company currently expects to achieve comparable store sales results in the mid single-digit positive range. Comparable store sales by division for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 are expected to be in the low single-digit positive range for Ann Taylor, and in the mid to high single-digit positive range for Ann Taylor Loft. Due to lower levels of markdown inventory, February comparable store sales are expected to be flat to low single-digit positive overall, with Ann Taylor expected to be flat and Ann Taylor Loft expected to be in the low single-digit positive range. Total Company comparable store sales for March and April are each expected to be in the mid single-digit positive range. Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 are expected to be in the mid single-digit positive range and in the low to mid single-digit positive range for the Fall 2004 season. For fiscal 2004, the Company projects continued improvement in its gross margin rate and expects selling, general and administrative expenses to be flat to fiscal 2003 as a percentage of net sales, with an anticipated increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. For the first quarter, the Company expects to see continued improvement in gross margin and an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales. The Company plans to open approximately 80 - 90 stores during fiscal 2004, comprised of approximately 10 - 15 Ann Taylor stores, approximately 65 - 70 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and approximately 5 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total Company square footage is projected to increase approximately 13 percent in fiscal 2004. This represents an approximate 4 percent divisional square footage increase for Ann Taylor, and an approximate 22 percent divisional square footage increase for Ann Taylor Loft. In the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company plans to open 2 new Ann Taylor stores and 7 new Ann Taylor Loft stores. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company plans to open 1 new Ann Taylor store and 23 new Ann Taylor Loft stores. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 are planned at $115 - 120 million, which includes costs for new store build outs, existing store renovations and warehouse and information system initiatives. Based on the above financial assumptions and planned store growth, the Company projects earnings per share on a diluted basis for fiscal 2004 to be between $2.45 and $2.55. The Company projects earnings per share on a diluted basis for the first and second quarters in the range of $0.45 - $0.47 and $0.58 - - $0.60, respectively and in the range of $1.42 - $1.48 for the Fall season. For fiscal 2004, the Company expects total inventory levels to be down approximately 5 percent on a per square foot basis in February and March compared to last year due to lower levels of markdown inventory, with the balance of the year flat to mid-single-digit positive compared to fiscal 2003. During the month of January, the Company closed 3 Ann Taylor stores and 1 Ann Taylor Factory store. The total store count at the end of fiscal 2003 was 648, comprised of 354 Ann Taylor stores, 268 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 26 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total store square footage increased 10.8 percent over the same period last year. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2004, the Company's net sales totaled $1,587,708,000, up 15.0 percent from $1,380,966,000 in fiscal 2002. By division, net sales for fiscal 2003 were $867,855,000 for Ann Taylor and $588,801,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the year increased 5.3 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 3.9 percent in fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales by division were up 3.2 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 5.3 percent decrease last year, and up 9.4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 1.0 percent decrease last year.

Exhibit 99.1 Ann Taylor NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y.10019 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES FEBRUARY SALES RESULTS AND RAISES FIRST ------------------------------------------------------------ QUARTER EARNINGS GUIDANCE ------------------------- New York, New York, March 4, 2004 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) - --------------------------------- announced today that total net sales for the four week period ended February 28, 2004 increased 26.7 percent to $102,955,000, from total net sales of $81,286,000 for the four week period ended March 1, 2003. By division, net sales were $54,418,000 for Ann Taylor and $40,603,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the period increased 15.3 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 8.6 percent for the same four week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal February 2004 were up 12.7 percent for Ann Taylor compared to an 8.0 percent decrease last year, and up 20.8 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 9.4 percent decrease last year. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "The sales momentum that began building in the fourth quarter of last year carried into February, with both divisions exceeding our expectations and experiencing double-digit comparable store sales results. At Ann Taylor, the mix of style and color was well received by our client and resulted in increased sales, particularly in the woven and pants categories. At Ann Taylor Loft, strong color and exciting fashion also played a prominent role in driving sales, which resulted in exceptional performance in all tops, separates and outerwear categories." Mr. Spainhour continued, "As a result of the exceptional sales performance experienced during February, we are raising first quarter earnings guidance from the range of $0.45 - $0.47 to the range of $0.47 - $0.49 per share on a diluted basis. Full year guidance is now in the range of $2.47 - $2.57 per share on a diluted basis." Total inventory levels at the end of February were down approximately 13 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 13 percent for Ann Taylor and 5 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The decrease in inventory levels compared to last year is attributable to better product sell-through. During the month of February, the Company opened two Ann Taylor Loft stores and one Ann Taylor Factory store. Additionally, two existing Ann Taylor Loft stores were converted to Ann Taylor Factory stores.

Exhibit 99.1 Ann Taylor NEWS RELEASE 142 WEST 57TH STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE - --------------------- ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES RECORD FISCAL YEAR 2003 FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR ------------------------------------------------------------------------- EARNINGS AND RAISES SECURITIES REPURCHASE PROGRAM CEILING TO $75 MILLION ------------------------------------------------------------------------ NEW YORK, NEW YORK, March 9, 2004 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today record net income for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2004 of $31,532,000, or $0.65 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 49.7 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $16,123,000, or $0.35 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.3 million shares outstanding), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As previously reported, total net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were $448,677,000, up 27.4 percent from $352,213,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. By division, net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were $243,414,000 for Ann Taylor and $171,847,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 increased 15.5 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 12.3 percent for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were up 14.4 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 14.6 percent decrease last year, and up 20.0 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 7.1 percent decrease last year. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.8 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to 52.0 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The increase is due to higher full price sales and higher margin rates achieved on non-full price sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were $191,956,000, or 42.8 percent of net sales, compared to $156,067,000, or 44.3 percent of net sales for the same period last year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased leverage on fixed expenses resulting from the increase in comparable store sales, offset, in part, by an increase in the provision for management performance bonus. Operating profit was 12.0 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to 7.7 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of last year. During the fourth fiscal quarter, the Company opened 2 new Ann Taylor stores and 11 new Ann Taylor Loft stores, and closed 3 Ann Taylor stores and 1 Ann Taylor Factory store. The total store count at the end of the fourth quarter was 648, comprised of 354 Ann Taylor stores, 268 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 26 Ann Taylor Factory stores. ================================================================================
2 ANNTAYLOR 2 Total store square footage increased 10.8 percent to 3,662,000 square feet as of January 31, 2004, from 3,305,000 square feet at the end of fiscal 2002. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 were $71,364,000, which included the addition of 8 new Ann Taylor stores, 61 new Ann Taylor Loft stores and 1 Ann Taylor Factory store, as well as investments in the Company's information systems and distribution center. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 are expected to be approximately $116,000,000, which includes the costs associated with opening 82 - 92 new stores, existing store renovations, and warehouse and information system initiatives. Total long-term debt at January 31, 2004 was $125,152,000. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under its $175,000,000 credit facility at any time during fiscal 2003. For the fiscal year-to-date period ended January 31, 2004, the Company's net income was a record $100,942,000, or $2.13 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.8 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $80,158,000, or $1.72 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 48.3 million shares outstanding) for the same period last year. Fiscal year-to-date net sales totaled $1,587,708,000, up 15.0 percent from $1,380,966,000 in fiscal 2002. By division, net sales for fiscal 2003 were $867,855,000 for Ann Taylor and $588,801,000 for Ann Taylor Loft. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period increased 5.3 percent, compared to a decrease of 3.9 percent for the same period last year. By division, fiscal 2003 comparable store sales were up 3.2 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 5.3 percent decrease last year, and up 9.4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 1.0 percent decrease last year. Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period ended January 31, 2004 was 54.5 percent, compared to 54.1 percent for the same period last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 43.7 percent, compared to 44.3 percent for the same period in fiscal 2002. The decrease was primarily due to increased leverage on fixed expenses resulting from the increase in comparable store sales. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "Although the Company got off to a slow start in fiscal 2003, the increase in comparable store sales and resulting improvement in gross margin allowed us to deliver record net income and earnings performance for the year. Our emphasis on strengthening the Ann Taylor brand and enhancing our client's overall shopping experience resulted in strong sales and gross margin performance at both retail concepts, particularly during the fourth quarter and holiday selling season." "For fiscal 2004, the Company remains comfortable with current earnings guidance in the range of $0.47 - $0.49 and $0.58 - $0.60 per share for the first and second quarters respectively, and full year earnings guidance in the range of $2.47 - $2.57 per share." ================================================================================
3 ANNTAYLOR 3 "Effective immediately I am pleased to announce that Tony Romano, who has been SVP - Logistics for the past 7 years, has been promoted to EVP, and adds Information Services to his Logistics responsibilities. I am also pleased to announce that Jim Smith, who is currently CFO and has been with the company for 11 years, has also been promoted to EVP and assumes the additional responsibilities of Real Estate and Construction." The Company's Board of Directors today voted to increase the Company's existing $50,000,000 securities repurchase program to $75,000,000, notwithstanding shares already repurchased under the original program. The Company also announced today that it has regretfully accepted the resignations of Gerald S. Armstrong and Tamara L. Heim from its Board of Directors. Mr. Armstrong, a director since 1989, told the Company that he was resigning "to spend more time on his business commitments at Arena Capital Partners and other business issues" adding, "This is a decision I have pondered for some time. With the company's recent performance and strong outlook, the timing seems right." Separately, the Board said it was honoring Ms. Heim's wish to spend more with her family and assess career options after resigning from Borders Group. Ms. Heim tendered her resignation to the Board under the Company's corporate governance guidelines upon relinquishing her positions at Borders.

EXHIBIT 99.1 ANN TAYLOR FOURTH QUARTER 2003 CONFERENCE CALL MODERATOR: MR. J. PATRICK SPAINHOUR MARCH 9TH, 2004 5:00 P.M. EST ------------- OPERATOR: Good afternoon and welcome to the Ann Taylor Stores Corporation. Company: Ann Taylor; Ticker: ANN; URL: http://www.anntaylor.com > Fourth Quarter 2003 conference call. - ------------------------ Today's call is being recorded. After the presenter's prepared comments, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, please press the one key followed by the digit four. Due to time constraints, please limit yourself to one question. These instructions will be repeated when we are ready to take questions. Before the conference call begins, Ann Taylor would like to remind you that certain statements made on this conference call and webcast are forward-looking statements, made pursuant to the safe harbour provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect Ann Taylor's current expectations concerning future events, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. A detailed discussion of these factors and uncertainties are contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to introduce Mr. J. Patrick Spainhour, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor. PAT SPAINHOUR, ANN TAYLOR STORES INCORPORATED: Good afternoon Kay Krill, President of our Ann Taylor Loft Division, Jerome Jessup , Senior Executive Vice President of our Ann Taylor Division, Jim Smith, Chief Financial Officer, and I are pleased that you could join us for our 2003 Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End Earnings report. We will speak to you today about Ann Taylor's recent performance and our plans to ensure consistent growth over the next several years. In addition to reviewing actions that led to another quarter and year of record earnings, we're excited to share with you our strategic growth initiatives. Our strategy in fourth quarter results signal a shift in our collective approach to our potential of how we operate, what our brand stands for, and where we are positioned in the market place. It is our expectation that you will leave this call with confidence that our strong performance will continue to 2004 and beyond. Let's begin with the fourth quarter. At this time last year, we announced record 2002 earnings based on improved inventory productivity and expense control. We have spent 2003 refocusing the company on growth while continuing those important operational disciplines. The results speak for themselves. For the year 2003, comparable store sales were up 5.3 percent, a 3.2 percent increase in Ann Taylor, and a 9.4 percent increase at Loft. Holiday 2003 was indicative of our new growth orientation. Those of you who have followed the brand in recent years know that the Holiday period has been an opportunity for the brand. As we shared with you on previous calls, we developed a comprehensive cross-functional execution plan to realize that opportunity. All aspects of the brand experience were involved in this effort, from our merchandise assortment, and external messaging, to a visual presentation, and store associate product knowledge. Our client's response was overwhelmingly positive. Comparable store sales were up 15.5 percent for the quarter, our highest fourth quarter comps in the last ten years. We were thrilled that both divisions contributed positively to these results. Comparable store sales increased 14.4 percent at Ann Taylor, and 20 percent at Loft. Our ability to drive significant top line growth while continuing to maximize the profitability of those sales contributed to our second consecutive year of record earnings. I am proud to announce fourth quarter earnings per share on a diluted basis of 65 cents, approximately an 86 percent increase over last year, and full year earnings per share on a diluted basis of $2.13, approximately a 24 percent increase over last year. Consistent with our ongoing strategy of enhancing our client knowledge, we conducted a quantitative research in 2003. While we have conducted research on our core clients in the past, this time we took a much broader approach in order to quantify the untapped opportunity among current and potential clients, and to gather insight about how to realize that opportunity. 1 ================================================================================
2 Through this research, we validated many of our existing assumptions, and uncovered new data that lead to new growth opportunities, all within our core competencies. Some opportunities, such as assortment customization and an increased focus on petites, are being executed across all divisions. Others are unique to Ann Taylor or Loft, and Jerome and Kay will tell you how with those in a few minutes. I am confident that these initiatives position us for continued comp store growth and record profitability. In addition to comp growth drivers, we are also in the process of implementing two new growth opportunities, loft.com and an evolved Ann Taylor factory store strategy. Loft.com will be launched this spring, and offers a new channel to existing clients, and a way for potential clients to enter the fold. We will open seven factory stores in 2004, all focused on the distribution of exclusive factory label products. Eight years ago, we identified a unique opportunity to leverage the Ann Taylor name to meet the needs of an underserved market. We launched Loft in the outlet environment in 1995, and in 1998, we redefined the strategy to move to other real estate venues, such as lifestyle centers, malls, and downtown locations. Today, Loft is one of the major success stories in the industry, and our primary growth vehicle. Over the course of the year, we will focus on identifying the next significant growth vehicle for the corporation. As we do with Loft, we will look to leverage the incredible awareness and equities of the Ann Taylor brand. The profitability of our businesses during the past two years have placed us in the enviable position of having a healthy cash position. A portion of this cash will be used to fuel the new concept development I just discussed, and to finance new store growth and infrastructure development. We will also continue to provide a direct return to shareholders. We announced today that we will increase our share repurchase program to 75 million dollars. This decision reflects our commitment to increasing shareholder value, and demonstrates our financial strength and confidence in the future. I will now turn you over to Jerome. JEROME JESSUP, ANN TAYLOR STORES INCORPORATED: Thank you Pat, and good afternoon everyone. Holiday 2003 represented the need and opportunity for a pivotal break through. Results for the last Holiday seasons lead many on the Ann Taylor team to conclude that as a wardrobing go to work brand, we could only have limited relevance in gifting. The team was challenged and pushed to cast perceptions aside and look at Q4 as a blank sheet and a fresh new opportunity. Months of work, re-work, and most importantly, a mindset change were rewarded with our strong fourth quarter performance. Sales totalled 243 million dollars, a 33 million dollar improvement, fuelled by a 14.4 percent comp. Top line growth lead to significant improvement in gross margin dollars. 83 percent of our sales increase came out of December. Our 28.8 percent comps that month were driven largely by elevating gift giving to a more defined strategic focus. For the first time in years, Ann Taylor was an authoritative gift-giving destination during fourth quarter by increasing the penetration of gift categories of tops, outerwear, and fashion accessories to 58 percent from 53 percent during the prior year period. Across categories, color was key driving impulse gifts and self-purchase. As the numbers illustrate, we achieved our objective. Just as important, our dramatic improvement gave us the confidence that Holiday 2004 presents an even greater opportunity. So what worked? Almost all product categories delivered positive full price comps. Performance in key giftable areas of cashmere sweaters, cold-weather accessories, and outerwear were especially strong. Our product offering dovetailed with all aspects of our external brand messaging, marketing, packaging, and in-store presentation to create a compelling call to action. We made significant incremental investments in our direct marketing to drive traffic and conversion. We also substantially increased the in-store presentation with dramatic changes to windows, attracting new clients and customers in to the store, and re-establishing the brand to our core clients. As pleased as the team was about the fourth quarter, we're excited about our February results. February represents only the beginning of the new product positioning for the brand. Sales overall increased 15 percent, driven by 12.7 comps and a significant improvement in full price sales, all on 13 percent less inventory than February, 2003. 2 ================================================================================
3 Four key product strategies drove the business, reinvigorating tops, getting famous for pants, establishing outerwear, and raising the bar on handbags, shoes, and accessories. These product strategies remain our focus throughout the first quarter and the year. Our woven tops assortment is on fire. Everything we deliver in color and pattern is a best seller. Both wovens and knits registered our highest full price comps. We delivered three pant fits in February, the Hampton, Grammercy and Madison , and initial results are exciting, particularly because March represents the full launch of our pants initiative. Outerwear was a business that did not exist last year. We had impressive sell-throughs on this high ticket category, all driven by color, novelty, and fashion. Consistent with our client research findings, this category proves that there is limited price resistance when the fashion is right. Accessories are farthest along in the evolution of our product offering, particularly in terms of fashion and color. The team coalesced early, and had the conviction to significantly elevate product from a design and quality perspective. Our client responded to color and fashion driving significant comp and gross margin improvement. Our success was not limited to bags, because our shoe category also registered impressive gain. Overall, our accessories led a color-coordinated message that was exciting and impulsive. Accessories are critical to our positioning and offer a tremendous sales and margin opportunity. They lifted the store in February, and we are confident that they will continue to do so throughout the year as accessories continue to improve. Our Ann Taylor marketing initiatives for the first quarter continue to focus on driving traffic and increasing conversion. First, we've redirected our marketing to highlight versatile separates. It's critical that we position the brand beyond the narrowness of our historic suiting positioning to capture more share of wallet. To deliver this message, we've increased circulation more than 40 percent through a spring preview postcard in February, and a spring catalogue in March. Ann Taylor's advertising placement for the spring season includes ads in the March issues of Vanity Fair, Elle, In Style, and Vogue. Findings from our comprehensive client research validated our fourth quarter and February strategies, and will play an even more important role in our positioning going forward. We validated our client profile, we know what differentiates her from other women is her fashion orientation, her shopping behaviour, and her end use needs. Our client is fashion conscious, and it's important for her to feel stylish and sophisticated at all times. While she has a need for professional career attire, our greatest opportunity to capture more of her share of wallet is through her relaxed business and refined casual needs. She demands quality in an upscale shopping environment, and demonstrates a willingness to pay full price for such an experience. The insights from our consumer research provided a strong foundation that can now drive our renewed focus on the client. I'll now review Ann Taylor's top strategies, all designed to grow greater share of segment and increase wallet share of existing clients. We'll evolve our distinctive style beyond our narrow set of associations that have become known for the modern, versatile wardrobe of updated American classics infused with fashion, femininity, and sophistication, grounded in versatile separates. Getting compulsive about fit is a competitive necessity, and no one competitor currently owns this competency. Yet it is critical to instill loyalty with our target clients. There is no one category where fit is more important than pants. Pants are a huge driver of her loyalty. As I mentioned earlier, we have developed a pant program that includes the delivery of three-branded fit, distinct in where each sits on the body. The program was launched in February, and we're already seeing very positive results. We plan to capitalize on our historic strength in petites by providing a unique multi-faceted interaction with the brand. Specifically, we will extend the product offering to include all categories, and offer more styles. We will create an in-store environment that makes Ann Taylor Petites her preferred destination. We'll boost marketing efforts to maximize the current business and generate awareness with non-clients by speaking directly to her. Lastly, we're continuing to roll out petite adjacencies, a program we initiated last year. And in late 2004, we will pilot stand-alone Petite stores. Our real estate invest/re-investing strategy supports our brand positioning with an elevated look, and provides additional product capacity. This program will consist of new stores, renovated, and expanded stores, and enhanced visual programs such as fixtures and additional mannequins. 3 ================================================================================
4 These strategic initiatives maximize our opportunity to fully realize what she already loves about the brand, but stretch its scope and emotional relevance. Our ultimate goal is that Ann Taylor will provide our client with modern American classics, and a versatile, sophisticated wardrobe that makes her feel confident and fashionable all in a compelling environment. Our break-through fourth quarter and improving February results confirm that we're on the right track to reinvigorate and dimensionalize this great brand. The momentum of our performance, coupled with the alignment of our team around a common vision, gives us tremendous confidence that our success will continue to build throughout the year and beyond. I'll now turn you over to Kay to speak about Ann Taylor Loft. KAY, ANN TAYLOR LOFT: Thank you Jerome, hello everyone. Loft clearly exceeded all of our financial goals, and strategic objectives again for fourth quarter and the year. We are beginning first quarter '04 with very strong momentum. February marks the sixth consecutive month of double digit comps for Loft. As I shared with you last quarter, we had one primary objective for Holiday with several supporting strategies to achieve record results and become top of mind for gift giving and get our share of fourth quarter business. Our performance was outstanding. We achieved a 20 percent positive comp, grew the business 53 percent or 60 million dollars, and our results on the top line translated to significant profitability improvement, and a 400 basis point improvement in our fourth quarter penetration to 29 percent from 25 percent last year. The most important message was all of our efforts were around building a compelling, exciting, overt gift focus from a product perspective, and to be more festive, authoritative, and fun from a marketing and in-store perspective. We delivered an integrated message that made an emotional connection with our client. Our product strategy was to distort the giftable categories of tops, outerwear, and accessories, to be 60 percent of our sales versus 57 percent in '02. We reached 65 percent. These categories far exceeded our expectation based on sales penetration and comp performance. Our margin on the gift categories increased dramatically. Everything worked. Even the wardrobing categories of separates and suits. Another strategy was to offer unexpected elements, and innovate new product categories, and they all worked. Sleepwear, baby, Loft sport, and small leather goods exceeded sales and gross margin, and are all being either chased for May onwards, or incorporated into our next fourth quarter in a more exciting way. We will continue to maximize our current opportunities, and evaluate new categories for our future growth. Our promotional strategies focused on a Holiday gift card, and a full price highlight December 1st through Christmas of our 39-dollar product. Those were so successful that we did not have to promote other product categories at all until after Christmas. All categories of tops, outerwear, separates, and accessories were especially strong, a significant increase in full price penetration. We postponed our 40 percent off POS until January, and did not have to anniversary a full price bounce back that month. Most importantly, the critical reason for our success, was we changed our mindset. All functional areas were all aligned around stepping out of our box, and focusing on getting our share of the holiday business. We had many creative sessions starting last March that were critical to our success and our integrated authoritative message, internally and externally. Our story for 2004 starts with momentum, building on top of a strong fourth quarter. Our 20 percent comp performance has transitioned in to an outstanding February, which also ended with a 20.8 percent comp in sales. Our results are impressive for the first month of the year, and a significant improvement in full price performance. All categories delivered full price comps, with tops, separates, outerwear, and petites registering the strongest performance. Four strategies that were a focus for February, and all of first quarter, was to have a high percentage of color in tops to drive emotional purchases, and the results were fabulous. Color drove all tops categories at 55 percent of sales versus 32 percent last year. Second, we started our pant initiative of building three distinct fits, incorporating all styles. Pant sales are up significantly over last year. These initial reads are encouraging, particularly since we did not begin communicating this strategy internally or externally until March 1st. We expect continued positive results, and are chasing June onwards. 4 ================================================================================
5 Our third strategy is around petites. We added petite sweaters to all stores in March, broadened our assortment, and communicated this effort in our March mailer, and a separate petite mailer, for April. And lastly, we continue to customize our assortment by climate, by end use, and by fashion preferences. Our tops and separates performance is maximized by having the appropriate fashion, fabric and yarn weight, sleeve length, and other silhouette opportunities in the right stores at the right time. We continue to see positive results from this effort. Loft marketing initiatives for the first quarter continue to focus on building brand awareness, driving traffic, and increasing conversion. We have three unique mailers for the first quarter, and the overall circulation is up 90 percent over last year. Our March mailer is our largest catalogue to date, highlighting our primary messages, fashion, petite, pant fit, and our 39-dollar offering. Loft's advertising placement for the spring season includes ads in the April issue of Marie Claire, In Style, Child, and Lucky, and the May issue of O, the Oprah magazine. Our strategy is to continue to reach new customers through advertising while getting more of our current clients dollars through our mailers and in-store events. We are definitely building brand awareness, and there is a buzz around the Loft concept that we need to continue to react to and maximize. The strategies that drove our success in the fourth quarter and February were consistent with the findings from our client research. We validated our client profile and her fashion and shopping preferences. We know that what differentiates her from other women is her fashion orientation, her shopping behaviour, her end use needs, and her love for great value. Our client is stylish. She wants updated classics that reflect current trends at great prices. She has a casual lifestyle, spending over 60 percent of her wallet on relaxed and casual clothing. Her clothes have to be appropriate for a variety of different wear occasions. We did have a key new learning about petites. Our target client base has a significantly higher petite percentage than the overall market. Utilizing the in-depth understanding of our client, and our experience and results in driving the Loft business, we developed core strategies to gain greater share of segment, and increased wallet share of existing clients. A high level summary of the top strategies are as follows. First, to maximize the feminine, casual, and relaxed opportunity, our casual and relaxed categories are enjoying strong results, representing 68 percent of our overall sales. Our target clients spend over 60 percent of their dollars in casual and relaxed categories, so we must better meet her needs in order to increase our share of her wallet. Earlier I shared our success of manually tailoring our offering by climate, store type, geography, fashion, and end use. To fully maximize these opportunities and processes, we are currently in the planning stages for an assortment planning system that can be leveraged by all divisions in order to truly realize the benefit from a sales and margin perspective. We will build a reputation as a petite destination through all aspects of our brand experience. Starting by increasing our product offering and marketing efforts around petites, we will do targeted direct mail and more overtly express the expanded variety and assortment we offer. We will create an environment that makes Loft her preferred place to shop. We will determine the ideal square footage for petites within current stores so we can create a store within a store for her. However, in order to meet her needs for variety, we will test and evaluate new formats to cater more to the petite client. These include adjacencies and stand-alone stores. We will start by testing adjacencies this year, and test stand-alones as early as 2005. We have an innovative culture at Loft. We need to continuously test and create new businesses within our box as well as potential stand-alone platforms. We tested sleepwear, baby sweaters, small leather goods, and Loft sport in 2003, and are building on the initial success of these categories for 2004. We will continue to evaluate new opportunities to better serve the wardrobing needs of our clients. As we have shared in previous calls, we plan to open 65 to 70 stores per year for 2004 and beyond. Ultimately, we believe the chain has the potential of at least 600 stores. In closing, we are still so passionate and excited about Loft's future. We have a fabulous team aligned to maximize our brand's positioning. Loft's over-arching objective is to realize the full potential of our unique niche, focusing on relaxed fashion 5 ================================================================================
6 that is feminine, fun, versatile, and of great quality, all at surprising prices. The momentum that carried us through 2003 and ended 2004 is strong. These outstanding results only raise the bar higher for the team. Our internal challenge is to continue to innovate, elevate, and evolve the Loft concept to extend our incredible performance and solidify our place as one of our industry's great success stories. Now back to Pat. PAT SPAINHOUR: Thank you Kay. Last Tuesday, we announced that our COO, Barry Erdos resigned his positions with the company. At that time, we stated that position would not be filled. That decision reflects the strength of our operations and support functions. To build on our solid foundation and position incorporation to achieve new heights in process excellence and operational efficiency, effective immediately, Tony Romano, who has been Senior Vice President of Logistics for the past seven years, has been promoted to Executive Vice President, and adds Information Services to his logistics responsibilities. We are also pleased to announce that Jim Smith, who is currently Chief Financial Officer, and has been with the company for 11 years, has been promoted to Executive Vice President, and assumes additional responsibilities of real estate and construction. The only other position that reported to the COO, the General Counsel, Barbara Eisenberg, will report directly to me. The depth of our bench strength has allowed all of these changes to be handled through internal promotions. Separately, the company announced today that it has regretfully accepted the resignations of Gerald S. Armstrong, and Tamara L. Heim from its Board of Directors. Gerry Armstrong has been a key member of our board since 1989, and a trusted advisor and he will truly be missed. And now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our financials. JIM SMITH, ANN TAYLOR STORES INCORPORATED: Thank you Pat. Good afternoon everyone. Today, we announced record net income for the fourth quarter ended January 31st, 2004 of 31.5 million or 65 cents per share on a diluted basis, compared to net income of 16.1 million, or 35 cents per share on a diluted basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. As previously reported, total sales for the fourth quarter were up 27.4 percent to 448.7 million from total sales of 352.2 million for the same period last year. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.8 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 compared to 52 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The increase is due to higher full price sales and higher margin achieved on non-full price sales. Selling, general, and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 were 192 million or 42.8 percent of net sales compared to 156 million or 44.3 percent of net sales for the same period last year. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased leverage on fixed expenses resulting from the increase in comparable store sales, offset in part by an increase in the provision for management performance bonus. Operating profit was 12 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, compared to 7.7 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of last year. For the fiscal year-to-date period ended January 31st, 2004, the company's net income was a record 100.9 million or $2.13 per share on a diluted basis compared to net income of 80.2 million or $1.72 per share on a diluted basis for the same period last year. Fiscal year-to-date net sales totaled 1.588 billion, up 15 percent from 1.381 billion as of February 1st, 2003. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period increased 5.3 percent compared to a decrease of 3.9 percent for the same period last year. By division, fiscal 2003 comparable store sales increased 3.2 percent for Ann Taylor, and 9.4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period ended January 31st, 2004 was 54.5 percent compared to 54.1 percent for the same period last year. 6 ================================================================================
7 Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 43.7 percent compared to 44.3 percent for the same period in fiscal 2002. The decrease was primarily due to increased leverage on fixed expenses, resulting from the increase in comparable store sales. Total store square footage increased 10.8 percent to 3.7 million square feet as of January 31st, 2004 from 3.3 million square feet at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 were 71.4 million, which included the addition of eight new Ann Taylor stores, 61 new Ann Taylor Loft stores, and one new Ann Taylor factory store, as well as investments in the company's information systems and distribution center. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 are expected to be approximately 116 million, which includes the cost associated with opening 82 to 92 new stores, expanding and renovating existing stores, and further developing our warehouse and information systems. From a new store perspective, we plan to open 65 to 70 Loft stores, ten to 15 Ann Taylor stores, and seven Ann Taylor factory stores during the year. For fiscal 2004, the company reiterates current earnings guidance in the range of 47 to 49 cents, and 58 to 60 cents per share for the first and second quarters respectively, and full year earnings guidance in the range of $2.47 to $2.57 per share. We will now open the call to questions. OPERATOR: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. If you have a question, please press the number one followed by four on your touchtone phone. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. The questions will be taken in the order they are received. We do ask that while you pose your question that you pick up your handset to provide the best sound quality. Please hold as we poll for questions. Our first question is coming from Dana Telsey of Bear Stearns. Company: Bear Stearns Companies Inc.; Ticker BSC; URL: http://www.bearstearns.com/. ---------------------------- DANA TELSEY, BEAR STEARNS: Good afternoon everyone. ALL: Hi Dana. DANA TELSEY: Hi. You've talked about the petites for both divisions. Can you talk a little bit about the margins on petites, how many stores you expect to open, and the square footage devoted to it. And Jim, margins have done terrific. How much more growth margin opportunity is there? Thank you. PAT SPAINHOUR: Dana, it's Pat. From a total petite perspective, we have been in the petites business for years and years. We don't see that there's going to be a difference between the petite margin as we move it forward, whether it's in a free-standing store or in an adjacency. We just don't like it in the underserved penetration relative to the national data where we have been tracking behind, and we're out to take advantage of this strategy, as well as other sizing strategies, in the future. JIM SMITH: As far as the gross margin, Dana, as we talked about before, there's two pieces to that. We think on the costing side, there's not opportunity as we sit here today. But more so on the full price sales side, we still think there's some upside potential to that number as we head into 2004, so we still think there is upside to the gross margin percentage that we achieved in 2003. DANA TELSEY: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Friedman of Merrill Lynch. Company: Merrill Lynch & Co Inc; Ticker: MER; URL: http://www.ml.com/. ------------------ MARK FRIEDMAN, MERRILL LYNCH: Thanks. Good afternoon everybody. ALL: Hello Mark. 7 ================================================================================
8 MARK FRIEDMAN: Nice job. Jerome and Kay, I was wondering if you guys could just talk, as you look into '04 where you think the biggest opportunity is product wise, and what do you think that needs the most work that's still in this line, especially on the Ann Taylor side, Jerome. Thanks. JEROME JESSUP: Mark, how are you. I believe that just in general, the overall elevation that's starting to flow into our stores around product, from a macro standpoint, is where our biggest opportunity is. And then secondly, within that, again so all categories, you would expect that after all that I've said, we would impose this versatility component where we are not so narrow in our offering, and that we are expanding as the months go by our opportunities to capture more of her shared wallet by offering more of her occasion and wear needs from relaxed business to a refined casual point of view. So I think overall, in general, and then individually by category, and specifically really developing this pant strategy. But that's where I see the overall trend. And again, I'll speak to what we've been doing in accessories as a great differentiator for us, and our results there, so.. PAT SPAINHOUR: One thing to add to the ATS piece of it, and we're already seeing the benefit of this, is the recovery of the tops business, just about in every classification of tops. As you've heard us complain the last couple of years not being there, it's now on a growth momentum with full product sell-throughs we haven't been able to experience in the last couple of years. KAY: And from a Loft perspective, we really feel the opportunity lies in this whole relaxed and casual separates in all related categories. As I said in the call, it represents about 68 percent of our business, and we feel like we have future potential around those categories. The other thing is petites is one of our key strategic objectives. We definitely think there's a lot of room for growth in the whole petite area. And also for us to focus on maximizing our new categories and our new businesses of sleepwear, baby, and Loft sport. MARK FRIEDMAN: Great, thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Lauren Levitan of SG Cowen. Company: SG Cowen Securities Corporation; Ticker: ;URL: http://www.cowen.com. --------------------- LAUREN LEVITAN, SG COWEN: Thanks, good afternoon. PAT SPAINHOUR: Hi Lauren. LAUREN LEVITAN: You talked about the client research that you conducted and what the work from it, and then Pat, you also made some comments on new growth drivers that you might be exploring in '04. I'm wondering if you could talk about whether or not we should look for those to be the acquisitions or if there's internal growth. And then also with respect to the client research, if you could maybe tell us if they've revealed anything about a plus size opportunity or any other opportunities under the Ann Taylor Stores or Ann Taylor Loft umbrella. Thank you. PAT SPAINHOUR: OK. As far as the type of growth that we're working on, as I said, it's going to be very much like what we did for Loft back in 1996/'97 when we defined that strategy as a needed growth engine out there. And right now we see the growth being organic. However, that doesn't mean that there's an opportunity to do that, that would propel the growth within the brand umbrella because we are going to stay focused on optimizing the Ann Taylor brand in the strategy. We'll certainly take advantage of it, and the balance sheet would certainly support that. But that's not our first go to. We are certainly in a process of working on ideas. We're incubating thoughts right now as to what that growth looks like, and we're focused on again delivering that opportunity. As far as plus sizes, plus sizing goes, as we did our research, yes, we learned some things about sizing, but not so much from the plus size perspective as opposed to the opportunity we have within the current sizing that we are fitting in the stores today. We, it's like petite, it's an under penetrated opportunity that we're trying to build strategy around, primarily marketing, to help drive our sizes ten through 16 sell-through. You'll see more of that opportunity expressed in both .com size as we go forward with the balance of this year. But plus sizing, we certainly have that as a concept, as an idea, but we need to maximize our size selling as we own it today. LAUREN LEVITAN: And Pat, separately can you comment on changes we might see in the board now that you have a couple of vacancies to fill? 8 ================================================================================
9 PAT SPAINHOUR: We're probably somewhat premature in responding to that. We just put the press release out, and the board will deal with how we're going to progress through those changes, if at all. LAUREN LEVITAN: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Janet Kloppenburg of JKK Research. JANET KLOPPENBURG, JKK RESEARCH: Everyone, congratulations. ALL: Thanks Janet. JANET KLOPPENBURG: Hi everybody, and congratulations to Tony and to Jim. I wanted to just ask a few questions. First, Kay, I'm wondering if your average store size will be going up because it sounds like adding a lot of new categories petites sleepwear, babies, sport, et cetera, and if you think or believe you have an opportunity to expand the size of your stores. KAY: OK. First of all, we initially launched the Loft concept. We were at 6,000 square feet, and we gradually brought those down to average of about 5,500. You're right, and we're going back up to at least 6,000 square feet. It's not larger. 6,000 - 6,500 in order to incorporate all of these new initiatives and to make sure that we have the square footage dedicated to the petite area in order to maximize that growth opportunity. But another thing that we are doing, as you have been hearing me say for the past year, is assortment customization. We are uniquely tailoring each store with the assortment that they need to maximize their own potential. So even some stores will remain at 5,500 square feet because they might not have the ultimate potential to be larger and to grow the business. PAT SPAINHOUR: Janet, to add on to that because it's important to the strategy as we roll out new stores in both divisions, and we are expanding the footprint for Ann Taylor somewhat as well for the same types of reasons. But our strategy now is to find as many locations where it's possible to have a separate entrance for petites as we did in Short Hills which is proving to be a tremendous success, be it petite adjacencies have paid tremendous dividends, and we want to parlay that strategy as much as we can to get the multiple growth in petites. JANET KLOPPENBURG: Great. And for Jerome, Jerome I listened to what you said about your product emphasis for the spring. And it sounds great. I'm just wondering if you're moving a little bit away from the suiting business and that sort of dress up business and going a little bit more casual, or was that just something I inferred. And also, if somebody could talk about the ad spending for the spring versus last spring. It sounds like it's moving higher. JEROME JESSUP: Hi Janet. JANET KLOPPENBURG: Hi Jerome. JEROME JESSUP: We believe fully that Ann Taylor has a market place differentiator in it's suiting, dresses, and occasion business, and we're going to maintain that business and look to get greater profitability out of all of those categories because we think it defines us very differently from a lot of people in the market place in our zone. I think greater clarification around really organizing and getting the assortment in between that, around modern versus versatile separates streamlines and much more profitable is where the focus will take us north of where we've been. So no, we don't not plan to lose that or go away from that. JANET KLOPPENBURG: Thank you. PAT SPAINHOUR: From the perspective of advertising spend, Janet, if you remember for the holiday fall last year, we stepped out in a major way, and significantly got paid for the additional advertising spend that we did in third and fourth quarters. And so we are continuing that same level of spend in to first and second quarter to get at that same new rate of spending. And as we saw from Holiday so far, the initial reach we'll always step up to the plate to deliver is paying off. JANET KLOPPENBURG: Great. Thank you very much. 9 ================================================================================
10 OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Stacy Pak of Prudential Equity Group. Company: Prudential Securities; URL: http://www.prudential.com/. - ------------------------- STACY PAK, PRUDENTIAL EQUITY GROUP: Thanks. Just really some clean up from other people's questions. Number one, on the petites, can you tell us just what the percent is going from and to or skus or categories, because I'm just not quite clear by business how much expansion there will be in petites. On the Ann Taylor store, how large is the new prototype size, and then Kay, on the sleepwear, the baby, and the sport, is that going to be all year or is that just Holiday '04? PAT SPAINHOUR: In terms of safety on the petite penetrations, we don't give out that number. We have really, the best way to approach it is we challenge the organization, why should we offer less for a petite client as we do for a missy client. And to the degree we can get to 100 percent, we'll do everything we can to try to make that petite client be as happy when she shops the brand in every channel, in every touch point that she has with the brand. And so the penetration will grow based upon that strategy. From the ATS prototype in the store, we're actually, as Kay mentioned, customizing what we need by market place based upon who the client base is and so on. We've typically in the past targeted a 4,500 square foot store. We have various sized stores in our new portfolio going forward. Now the prototype that you may be referring to is we're going to take the design enhancement architecturally out of Short Hills and put those in new stores to the degree that we think it's the appropriate thing to put forward. But we, you know, it's not a matter of testing these new store sizes. It's just a matter of saying the Baltimore market, because it makes its client who it is versus the Columbus, Georgia market based upon who the client and the market is, requires more or less relative to the prototype size that we're trying to deliver out there. STACY PAK: So there's not for the stores, for Ann Taylor stores, there's no more change in the prototype from like you are with Loft from 55 up to 65. PAT SPAINHOUR: You know, I could say the same thing I just said for Ann Taylor Loft, Kay just gave you some parameters. From 4,500 to 52, 5,300 for Ann Taylor would be in that same type of thing, but there's not one number that we're operating off of. It's dependent upon the customization by market. STACY PAK: And then Kay, the .. KAY KRILL: OK. The sleepwear and, let me start with Loft sport and small leather goods, definitely have been incorporated into our business and we'll offer all quarters this year. Sleepwear was only tested in 50 stores for Holiday. It was fabulous other than the pajamas in a bag, it was in all stores. We have approached that from a quarterly perspective. We have first quarter assortment, second, third, and fourth. We have strengthened that assortment as we've gone through the year. And hopefully we're going to be in at least 250 stores by next holiday, but the selling has been absolutely terrific here, and we've ramped up the store growth as we've progressed through the year, and as we've chased it. The baby sweaters and accessories were also a test in 50 stores. They did absolutely fabulous during the Holiday period, and we're approaching that business as part of our gifting strategy. We'll offer baby again next fourth quarter in more stores. We're still playing with that number as we speak. But we are looking to a little bit more robust assortment. More offering, more novelty, and potentially up to size three or four. STACY PAK: Great. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Morris of Harris Nesbitt. JOHN MORRIS, HARRIS NESBITT: Thanks. Congratulations on a great fourth quarter and Holiday. ALL: Thank you. JOHN MORRIS: The, yeah, this one's sort of a quick question, maybe you can give us a little bit more breakdown on the cap-ex plan for next year, you know, in terms of, outside some of the store spending what else you're spending for. It looks like a little bit higher than I would have thought. If you could give us maybe a break down. 10 ================================================================================
11 JIM SMITH: Yeah, what we're doing John, is we are going to open more stores next year so you do have some increase there. From an IT perspective, we're probably close to doubling what we spent in the current year next year, so you're seeing an uptick there. And the other thing we're going to do is what we started this year with investing more back into the older Ann Taylor stores, we're going to continue in to 2004 and beyond, and that's another item that we've increased the actual dollars year over year. JOHN MORRIS: OK, great. Thanks. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kim Greenberger of Lehman Brothers. KIM GREENBERGER, LEHMAN BROTHERS: Great. Good afternoon, thank you, and congratulations on a great fourth quarter. My question is for Jerome. Jerome, can you talk about the changes, if any, in fashion sensibility that we should be seeing here through the spring and summer, or is it that the changes you're making to the assortment are more about category development? JEROME JESSUP: I think it's both, and I think that you'll see that evident as we go forward. This is a customer who wants fashion, she wants in an Ann Taylor way, and there are definitely guard rails to stay within, interpret those trends across all categories. Even in our suiting business we found that we had not updated our suiting business to a place where she thinks it's compelling and a reason to buy at full price. So that really has been the focus, and will continue to be. This is a citizen of the world kind of woman. She sees everything, and she makes the decisions around her product choices or her purchases based on that, and we will reflect that go forward in our assortments along the time line. KIM GREENBERGER: Jerome, in terms of the fitting category, what are the opportunities on the fabric side do you see? Are you going to stay with the synthetics and the polyester blends, or do you think there's an opportunity to broaden the fabrication on the fitting side? JEROME JESSUP: Absolutely, and it's really that simple. We have not given her enough new fabric choices, and if you're a customer, you might have noticed that. So we intend to broaden that. Fabrication choice is absolutely key. KIM GREENBERGER: Great. Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dorothy Lakner of CIBC. Company: CIBC; Ticker: BCM; URL: http://www.cibc.com. - ------------------- DOROTHY LAKNER, CIBC: Just a follow up, but on the other side of that question. In terms of the relaxed part of the business, Kay, you said that that had gotten to be about 80 feet, 68 percent of sales, sorry. Where do you think that could go at Loft? And then Jerome, at Ann Taylor, where would you expect that to sort itself out, even as you, I guess, increase or upgrade the suit part of the business? JEROME JESSUP: From an Ann Taylor perspective, I think it's less about the penetration since I'm speaking around versatility. What this customer wants from us and what we're seeing her inclinations to be are that she wants clothing that's versatile and different from the Loft the versatility in the casual penetration, the versatility in the casual assortment is going to be much more refined and much more elevated from a sophistication standpoint than you would see at Loft. DOROTHY LAKNER: Would you expect the separates though to end up being a larger percent of the business versus the traditional suit business at Ann Taylor? JEROME JESSUP: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. DOROTHY LAKNER: And at Loft? KAY: At Loft we are currently at about 68% with the casual and the relaxed categories. We're seeing tremendous growth right now and tremendous sales through this first quarter. We think we definitely have potential but I think our opportunity is really 11 ================================================================================
12 to realize it across all product categories not just separates and tops. We think we have more opportunity in the whole accessory and footwear component, to really get that ramped up. DOROTHY LAKNER: Okay great, thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you our next question is coming from Barbara Wyckoff of Buckingham Research Company: Buckingham Research Associates; URL: http://www.buckingham-research.com/ ---------------------------------- BARBARA WYCKOFF, BUCKINGHAM RESEARCH: Hi everybody congratulations, what a year. FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi Barbara. BARBARA WYCKOFF: Hi. What mounted peak margins are sort of in view? What operations - operating margins do you think are possible and then sort of related to that you know where are the margins in the factory stores relative to the, to the two brands? Where should they be? You know is it possible that they can run healthy operating margins? You know since you're basically going to be cutting four more stores there, as opposed to just using it as a closeout kind of initiative? Then I have another question after that. JIM SMITH: Okay I think on the factory stores Barbara, there's two answers. The stores we talked about opening this year, the seven stores would be mostly factory direct product. So they would have pretty good operating profits in them. I'm not going to get into specifics how it compares to stores and Loft. And then the other ones that are clearance centers you know it's a whole different point of view, where you're trying to get out of product and liquidate through it. So that would still be looked at as a clearance center, but the new stores will have profitability opportunity. As far as we go forward, when we look beyond '04 as we start moving forward we think we can get back to those historical numbers we've had before which was in the 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 percent of operating profit as we move out into the next few years. BARBARA WYCKOFF: Okay and can you by - by division breakout how many stores you have in lifestyles centers, street centers and mall locations? JIM SMITH: We have in Loft, we have about 52% sitting in malls, about 35% sitting in lifestyles centers and the remainder would be downtown. But the go-forward on the lifestyles centers we're looking to open more than 50% of our new stores will be lifestyles centers. As far as Ann Taylor goes where at about 62% sit in malls, about 25% sit in village locations and the remainder are downtown stores. BARBARA WYCKOFF: Okay great thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you our next question is coming from Richard Baum of Credit Suisse First Boston Company: Credit Suisse First Boston; Ticker: CSFB; URL: http://www.csfb.com/ ------------------- RICHARD BAUM, CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON: Hi guys. JIM SMITH: Hey Richard. RICHARD BAUM: Can you hear me okay? JIM SMITH: Yes. PAT SPAINHOUR: Yes. RICHARD BAUM: Can you just talk about, I guess, the composition of the same store sales results in terms of transactions versus ticket. And then secondly more for Jerome in terms of average price points as you go through your mix, where do you expect them to be relative to where they were a year ago? PAT SPAINHOUR: Richard, I'll take the first part of the question, then Jerome can respond. All of our quantifiable particularly have come out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter in terms of traffic by itself; transaction bag use, full price 12 ================================================================================
13 selling, which speaks to the quality, the acceptance of the product from our client base, conversion rate against that higher traffic. You know any way you want to look at it; the quantifiables began to build last year across the chain. And every division participating in that, with the increased traffic the exciting part is to see the higher conversion against that traffic because that goes a long way to driving comps and that's where our focus is. JEROME JESSUP: And Richard there's no real swing in average unit retail, in Ann Taylor stores this year over last year. RICHARD BAUM: And that's including, obviously the fact that you're going to be introducing and offering different fabrics than you have in the past? JEROME JESSUP: Yes, just better fabric choices. Outerwear accessories if anywhere would be where the up tick would be. RICHARD BAUM: Okay thanks. OPERATOR: Thank you our next question is coming from Richard Jaffe of UBS < Company: UBS; Ticker: UBS; URL: http://www.ubs.com ------------------ RICHARD JAFFE, UBS: Um thanks very much, a couple of I guess follow up questions. New businesses were mentioned, do you want to talk about the possibility of a man Taylor business? JEROME JESSUP: No, that made me laugh, that's pretty funny. RICHARD JAFFE: Is that because it's too close to the bone or just too far-fetched? JEROME JESSUP: No, I've just used that same term before, it made us laugh. RICHARD JAFFE: Great minds think alike. JEROME JESSUP: There you have it. RICHARD JAFFE: Curiously though, you mentioned no upside to the initial merchandise margins despite what we're hearing about prices coming down in the Far East and quota disappearing. Could you comment on that? On why you don't think you could buy the same products for less next year? JIM SMITH: What we were talking about Richard, was really talking about '04. The margins for the current year and as you know the cost being - there isn't a benefit at this point in time, with the quota in there. And as we look into '05 you know we're taking the position right now that we think the cost will be relatively flat. Yes there's the potential that you could have, you know you hear it out there, a 10 -15% reduction in cost because of quota going away. But we're still going to take the position right now that that necessarily isn't going to flow through to us. So as we get closer, and we will continue to take a look at that, and if in fact the quota prices do go away and we have lower costs, you know we'll look at both sides of it. We'll look at actually putting some more back into the product and then we will also look at what it can do to our profitability. RICHARD JAFFE: Can you just comment on your inventory objectives? You've continued to trim inventory and speed turns and while it's tremendous success I'm wondering how much further you want to take that or when you start running with flat or actually building inventory? JIM SMITH: Yeah what we've looked at is we started the year low as you know we have low carry over units. What we're looking to get back on in April is to get back more to that flattest range and as we go through the year to be flat through positive 5% inventory in the stores Richard. RICHARD JAFFE: And that's by the end of this quarter and that would be sustained through the balance of the year? 13 ================================================================================
14 JIM SMITH: That is the game plan, yes. RICHARD JAFFE: Could you comment on the ad spends this year versus last. Or ad and marketing spend? PAT SPAINHOUR: We will get the rates Richard but I can as said earlier on this call that we are spending for the first two quarters the up tick that was spent as a percent of sales of the last two quarters of last year which really helped drive that business. So we've got an incremental spending year over year for the first half of the year just because of the increase that we put out there. Beyond that we're doing things that marketing - - strategically that will drive that spend up as well too. But we have stepped up, that's probably the single largest SG&A increase that we had budgeted for this year. RICHARD JAFFE: Okay that's helpful thank you. The Ann Taylor credit card it seems particularly pervasive in stores you know the marketing side of it. Where does that stand in terms of penetration of total sales and where would you hope to get it? JIM SMITH: We don't specifically talk about that Richard but since we've sold it off two years ago the penetration has doubled on it and we look to continue to build on that. RICHARD JAFFE: Um. JIM SMITH: Richard, we're going to have to go to the next question now. RICHARD JAFFE: Thank you very much. JIM SMITH: All right thanks. JEROME JESSUP: Thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you our next question is coming from Harry Ikenson of First Albany Capital. Company: First Albany Capital Inc; Ticker: FACT; URL: http://www.fac.com/ ------------------- HARRY IKENSON, FIRST ALBANY CAPITAL: Thank you good afternoon. Jerome a couple of follow-ups, for a little more detail. Could you give us some examples of some of the new fabrications that have erupted over the last four weeks or so and some of the new fabrications expected to come in the next couple of months? Second could you also give us an idea of the goal on our relaxed separates where it was before, where it is now, where it is going? Same thing on accessories, where the goal is for this year versus where it was at the end of last year. And then also additionally on visuals could you give us some examples of where the spending is going to go on some specific visual changes in the store? Thank you. JEROME JESSUP: First of all in terms of fabrications some of the things that have been working for us is anything that is fashion forward, anything that is texture, pattern, clearly color has been driving our business tremendously. And this time over last year we have absolutely fully penetrated color in a much more advanced way so we are seeing the response to color and have been since Q4. Fabrication, anything that again has been different from where we've been. We're still seeing some great response to building a stretch business in bottoms, that's been incredible. And anything that we seem to put stretch in has worked for us. Um I'm trying to remember what the rest of your questions were. HARRY IKENSON: Okay on, also are there any new fabrications somebody said stretch but moving on to the other parts of the question - relaxed separates and accessories, what's the goal percent versus where it was at the end of the year? JEROME JESSUP: From a percent standpoint, I won't speak to you but it is going north to where we are looking to build those categories where we think that we've been missing business for the last year or so, really ramping those up. 14 ================================================================================
15 HARRY IKENSON: And on visuals can you give us some examples? JEROME JESSUP: Right, we are currently exploring opportunities around new window presentation format, mannequins and fixtures. To gravitate with what we're doing with our tops business. HARRY IKENSON: One final question for both divisions. Both divisions are focusing on this pants strategy, which I think is terrific, could each one of you tell me if you get pants correct - - which it looks like to me like you have, and you've both improved on tops and Loft did tops good anyway. It seems to be important that it's a multiple sale when you sell pants you sell more tops. I'd like to know the experience that you have in each division on how many tops you could sell for pants and how this could spur multiple sales. Thank you. PAT SPAINHOUR: I'm going to jump in and speak for both of them because we can't talk about the numbers obviously. But it does work together, you're right. We're a wardrobing company foundation to begin with and as we define a pant fit that's important to the client that she comes in and she can depend upon that fit day in and day out. And it has the name that she knows what it is - it certainly helps her mind set as she goes through that good fit experience. That certainly leads to more wardrobing, be it tops or other components, being shoes and accessories as well. And we do see the related selling that the pants business is driving and both divisions are successful. And I'll tell you that without marketing in February we drove a significant increase in this pants strategy. The marketing is set in the March doorstep for it and then at Ann Taylor we experience the same type of lift and in February as well and it continues. But you're point is absolutely right we do get a lift and a gain in other related selling once we get the fit established and it's working. HARRY IKENSON: All right my experience has told me it's usually two to three tops and other items if you get a pants sale but okay thanks. OPERATOR: Thank you our next question is coming from Mike Shrekgast of Delaware Investments Company: Delaware Investments; URL: http://www.delawareinvestments.com/ ----------------------------------- MIKE SHREKGAST, DELAWARE INVESTMENTS: Hey guys just wondering if you could tell me how much of the share re-purchase plan you've utilized already? JIM SMITH: I mean what we utilized last year Mike. MIKE SHREKGAST: Yeah. JIM SMITH: We just bought back about 13 million dollars worth but we just re-instituted so we took it up to an additional 75 million we can buy back. MIKE SHREKGAST: Okay and the additional IT spending can you just tell me what you're spending that on? Is that going to be software for more regional, more regional merchandise? PAT SPAINHOUR: One of the largest expenditures, Mike that we're putting our there is the new sourcing system, the whole sourcing infrastructure from pre-manufacturing a design concept kind of starting point. To manage that whole process for us around the world and that will be a multi-year, multi-phase type of a process. The other key thing that we're doing from an application perspective is our new assortment planning system that we're just in the stages now of defining requirements for, and the team is gathering those type things. It's to automate what Kay and her team have been doing manually, very successfully but to take it to the next level and get Ann Taylor up on that same type of customized approach so we can get the right products to the right stores based on demographics. Those are the two key drivers, everything else is we have the new store systems coming in. None of which individually are big but it's the multiples that we're doing out there, other merchandising systems, inventory management systems we do have some infrastructure things that we'll always have every year in terms of platform architecture that we'll always be upgrading. And then the disaster recovery strategies that we are engaged in, and are the people already insured that we can protect the business. 15 ================================================================================
16 MIKE SHREKGAST: And just looking back over the last year when you see how the gross margin has improved, can you just break out how much of that you think came from sourcing and how much came from full price selling? PAT SPAINHOUR: Oh it's almost a - sourcing and IMU and those type things which grew our margins for the first eight years, I was with the company by almost ten points just because we bought out all of our sourcing partners, really has added a lot of value. However as we've told you guys in the last two, three years that the big leaps and IMU that we were gaining you know, is down to that 30 to 40 basis points if in fact we can get that. The full price sell through is the key driver and particularly in fall of last year and we're expecting that to continue into this year as well. IMU we all ought to check on the IMU the sourcing gain to the degree that we have strategies uniquely to drive the full price sell through. We hold our sourcing people certainly accountable for delivering IMUs that allow us to have a luxury and gross margin that we've been enjoying. MIKE SHREKGAST: Okay thanks a lot. OPERATOR: Thank you and I will now turn the call back over to the speakers for any further or closing comments. PAT SPAINHOUR: That's it we're through and thank you very much. JIM SMTIH: Good night everyone, thank you. OPERATOR: Thank you this does conclude this afternoon's teleconference you may disconnect your lines and enjoy your day. 16

Gross margin also increased significantly over last year. At Ann Taylor, client response to color, fashion and new fabrications continues to improve. At Ann Taylor Loft, sales once again exceeded expectations, with April marking the eighth consecutive month and third consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable store sales growth. The emphasis on color, fashion and value resulted in exceptional full price sales results across every product category." Mr. Spainhour continued, "Once again, due to continued sales and gross margin gains, we are revising first quarter earnings guidance on a pre-stock split diluted basis to the range of $0.64 - $0.65, up from $0.54 - $0.56 per share. For the second quarter, the Company remains comfortable with current guidance in the range of $0.58 - $0.60 per share on a diluted basis. As a result of improved first quarter earnings, full year guidance is now in the range of $2.64 - $2.73 per share on a diluted basis. These estimates do not include the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split approved by the Company's Board of Director's on April 29, 2004. Comparable store sales for the second quarter are still expected to be in the mid single-digit positive range, with Ann Taylor expected to be in the low single-digit positive range and Ann Taylor Loft expected to be in the mid to high single-digit positive range." Total inventory levels at the end of April were down approximately 1 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 4 percent for Ann Taylor and up approximately 6 percent for Ann Taylor Loft.

NEWS RELEASE                                   
142 WEST 57 STREET, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019         
TH
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
         NEW YORK, NEW YORK, May 12, 2004 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today record net income for the first quarter ended May 1, 2004 of $31,768,000, or $0.65 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 50.1 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $17,928,000, or $0.39 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 47.9 million shares outstanding) in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
         As announced last month, the Company's Board of Directors approved a 3-for-2 split of the Company's common stock in the form of a stock dividend. One additional share of common stock for every two shares owned will be distributed on or about May 26, 2004 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 11, 2004. Adjusted earnings per share, restated for the effect of the stock split, were $0.43 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 75.1 million shares outstanding) in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to $0.26 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 71.9 million shares outstanding) in the first quarter of fiscal 2003.
         As previously reported, total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $433,246,000, up 23.1 percent from $352,017,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. By division, first quarter net sales were $213,424,000 for Ann Taylor, up from $201,326,000 for the same period last year, and $185,387,000 for Ann Taylor Loft, up from $119,923,000 for the same period last year. Comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 11.9 percent, compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 6.5 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were up 4.2 percent for Ann Taylor compared to an 8.1 percent decrease last year, and up 24.8 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 2.8 percent decrease last year.
         Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "We are very pleased with the Company's first quarter performance. Both full price and comparable store sales increased significantly over last year, with strong gains in gross margin driving a 470 basis point increase in the gross margin rate compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Signaling client acceptance of its return to brand profile, Ann Taylor experienced its fourth consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales, and we expect to build on this momentum in the second quarter and fall season. Ann Taylor Loft is experiencing tremendous growth, as evidenced by its third consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable store sales growth. This healthy sales performance, combined with our extensive store-growth plans, continues to make Ann Taylor Loft one of the most compelling growth stories in the women's retail industry. We are also pleased to announce the May 3, 2004 launch of anntaylorLOFT.com, which was designed as an on-line extension of the in-store experience, offering a wide selection of Ann Taylor Loft merchandise."
ANNTAYLOR  2
         Mr. Spainhour continued, "We are projecting full year earnings per share on a pre-stock split diluted basis in the range of $2.65 - $2.73, and remain comfortable with current earnings per share guidance for the second quarter and fall season in the range of $0.58 - $0.60, and $1.42 - $1.48, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share, reflecting the issuance of additional shares of common stock resulting from the previously discussed stock split, would be $0.39 - $0.40 and $0.95 - $0.99 for the second quarter and fall season, respectively. Adjusted full year guidance would be in the range of $1.77 - $1.82 per share on a diluted basis. Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 are expected to be in the mid single-digit positive range, with Ann Taylor expected to be in the low single-digit positive range and Ann Taylor Loft expected to be in the high single-digit positive range."
         Total inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were down 1 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 4 percent for Ann Taylor and up approximately 6 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The Company still expects inventory levels on a per square foot basis to be flat to mid single-digit positive for the full year compared to last year.
         Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 58.4 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 53.7 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in gross margin was the combined result of higher full price sales and higher margin rates achieved on non-full price sales at both divisions.
         Selling, general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $199,288,000, or 46.0 percent of net sales, compared to $158,618,000, or 45.1 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher marketing costs, an increase in the provision for management performance bonus and severance expense. These increases were partially offset by an overall leveraging of expenses due to the increase in comparable store sales.
         Operating profit was 12.4 percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 8.6 percent of net sales in the first quarter of last year.
         During the first fiscal quarter, the Company opened one new Ann Taylor store, 16 new Ann Taylor Loft stores and two new Ann Taylor Factory stores. Additionally, two existing Ann Taylor Loft stores were converted to Ann Taylor Factory stores. The total store count at the end of the first quarter was 667, comprised of 355 Ann Taylor stores, 282 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 30 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
         Total store square footage increased 10.8 percent to 3,768,000 square feet as of May 1, 2004, from 3,400,000 square feet at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Total square footage by division at the end of the first quarter was 1,850,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 1,650,000 square feet for Ann Taylor Loft.

         During the first quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company repurchased 300,000 shares of its common stock, using $12,600,000 of the $75,000,000 authorized under the securities repurchase program approved by its Board of Directors on March 9, 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 Ann Taylor NEWS RELEASE 142 West 57th Street New York NY 10019 ANN TAYLOR ANNOUNCES INTENT TO REDEEM CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES -------------------------------------------------------------------- New York, New York, May 20, 2004 - AnnTaylor Stores Corporation, Inc. --------------------------------- (NYSE: ANN) announced today that it provided The Bank of New York, as Trustee under the indenture, with notification that it intends to redeem all of its $199,072,000 principal amount at maturity of its convertible subordinated debentures effective June 18, 2004. Under the terms of the notes, at any time on or after June 18, 2004, AnnTaylor Stores Corporation may redeem the notes on at least 30 days' notice to the holders. The redemption price on June 18, 2004 is $635.42 per thousand of the principal amount. The redemption price is comprised of the issue price of $552.56, plus accrued original issue discount of $82.86. Accrued interest will be paid together with the redemption proceeds. As a result of this redemption notification, the Company expects that holders will convert their notes into approximately 5.4 million shares of AnnTaylor Stores Corporation common stock (after the 3-for-2 stock split to be distributed on or about May 26th), on or before June 18, 2004. This expectation is based on AnnTaylor Stores Corporation's common stock continuing to trade at a price greater than the conversion price. Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said "The anticipated conversion of the convertible notes into shareholders' equity is in line with the Company's strategy of strengthening its financial structure. This anticipated conversion will reduce the Company's annual interest expense by approximately $4.5 million, but will have no impact on fully diluted earnings per share."

        Comparable store sales for the period increased 11.9 percent compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 0.2 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal June 2004 were up 6.7 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 2.5 percent decrease last year, and up 20.9 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 2.1 percent increase last year.
        Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "June was another strong month for the Company, with both divisions achieving sales gains over last year. At Ann Taylor, sales of all categories of tops were particularly strong, which combined with an increase in promotional activity, resulted in higher comparable store sales. At Ann Taylor Loft, full-price sales drove the business, especially in separates, tops, fashion accessories and petites. All merchandise categories experienced strong sales gains over last year, as evidenced by the division's tenth consecutive month of double-digit comparable store sales growth. Clients continue to respond to Ann Taylor Loft's great fashion and novelty at surprising prices, with halters, circle skirts, item jackets and cropped pants being standouts."
        Mr.Spainhour continued, "We remain comfortable with current earnings per share guidance for the second quarter, fall season and full year in the range of $0.39  $0.40, $0.95  $0.99, and $1.77  $1.82 per share, respectively. July comparable store sales are expected to be flat to last year, with Ann Taylor expected to be in the flat to low single-digit negative range and Ann Taylor Loft expected to be in the low to mid single-digit positive range."
        Total inventory levels at the end of June were up approximately 2 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year, consistent across both divisions.
        From a national perspective, both divisions performed well throughout the country.

NEWS RELEASE                                   
142 WEST 57 STREET, NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019         
TH
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
        NEW YORK, NEW YORK, August 11, 2004  AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today record net income for the second quarter ended July 31, 2004 of $30,211,000, or $0.41 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 74.7 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $21,177,000, or $0.30 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.4 million shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 second quarter earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2004.
        As previously reported, total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $472,634,000, up 21.1 percent from $390,207,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. By division, second quarter net sales were $221,661,000 for Ann Taylor, up from $216,038,000 for the same period last year, and $208,541,000 for Ann Taylor Loft, up from $140,008,000 for the same period last year. Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 7.0 percent, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 5.3 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were up 0.8 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 4.9 percent increase last year, and up 18.1 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 5.7 percent increase last year.
        Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "The Company achieved record net income for the second quarter, driving earnings performance that increased 37 percent over last year. Our new store growth strategy and strong comparable store sales contributed to the double-digit sales growth experienced during both the second quarter and spring season."
         Mr. Spainhour continued, "We are currently projecting flat to slightly negative comparable store sales for the month of August, however we expect comparable store sales in the mid single-digit positive range for the third quarter and the low single-digit positive range for the fourth quarter. For the fall season, we anticipate gross margin as a percentage of net sales to decrease compared to last year. However, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales will also decline compared to last year as a result of increased leverage. We remain comfortable with current earnings guidance for the fall season in the range of $0.95  $0.99 per share on a diluted basis, which represents a 12 to 17 percent increase over the same period last year. We further project third and fourth quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.48  $0.50 and $0.47  $0.49, respectively. Full year guidance is now in the range of $1.79  $1.83 per share on a diluted basis."
ANNTAYLOR 2
        Total cost inventory levels at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were up 9 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. By division, cost inventory levels on a per square foot basis were up approximately 10 percent for Ann Taylor and up approximately 4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The increase is primarily due to higher in transit inventory levels compared to last year. The Company expects cost inventory levels for the remainder of fiscal 2004 to increase 10  20 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. The increase is primarily due to an overall change in product mix and product upgrades at the Ann Taylor division, costs associated with the phase-out of quota and incremental costs associated with shipping merchandise by air. The Company expects unit inventory levels for the remainder of fiscal 2004 to increase 5  10 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year.
        Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 53.0 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 51.9 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2003. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased profitability at Ann Taylor Loft.
        Selling, general and administrative expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 were $200,159,000, or 42.3 percent of net sales, compared to $166,660,000, or 42.7 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to increased leverage on fixed expenses as a result of higher comparable store sales, partially offset by increased marketing costs.
        Operating profit was 10.6 percent of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 9.2 percent of net sales in the second quarter of last year.
        During the second fiscal quarter, the Company opened one Ann Taylor store, 16 Ann Taylor Loft stores and four Ann Taylor Factory stores. Additionally, one existing Ann Taylor store was closed. The total store count at the end of the second quarter was 687, comprised of 355 Ann Taylor stores, 298 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 34 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
        Total store square footage increased 14.2 percent to 3,893,000 square feet as of July 31, 2004, from 3,408,000 square feet at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2003. Total square footage by division at the end of the second quarter was 1,851,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 1,745,000 square feet for Ann Taylor Loft.
        For the full spring season (fiscal year-to-date period ending July 31, 2004), the Company's net income was $61,979,000, or $0.84 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 74.9 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $39,105,000 or $0.56 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.1 million shares outstanding), for the same period last year. Fiscal 2003 spring season earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2004.
ANNTAYLOR 3
        Spring 2004 net sales totaled $905,880,000, up 22.0 percent from $742,224,000 in spring 2003. By division, net sales for the spring season were $435,085,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $417,364,000 last year, and $393,928,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $259,931,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the spring 2004 season increased 9.3 percent over the same period last year. Comparable store sales by division were up 2.4 percent for Ann Taylor and up 21.2 percent for Ann Taylor Loft.
        Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the spring 2004 season was 55.5 percent, compared to 52.8 percent in spring 2003. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to higher full price sales at Ann Taylor Loft and higher margin rates achieved on full price and non-full price sales at both divisions.
        Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 44.1 percent for the spring 2004 season compared to 43.8 percent for the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher marketing costs and an increase in the provision for management performance bonus. These increases were partially offset by an overall leveraging of expenses due to the increase in comparable store sales.
        During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company repurchased 1,700,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of $46,400,000. Since the end of the second quarter, the Company repurchased an additional 440,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $10,000,000, bringing the total repurchased during fiscal 2004 to 2,590,000 shares. To date, the Company has utilized approximately $69,000,000 of the $75,000,000 previously authorized under its securities repurchase program. The Company's Board of Directors yesterday approved the increase of its $75,000,000 securities repurchase program to $100,000,000, not including the cost of shares already repurchased.
        On June 18, 2004, the Company issued approximately 5,400,000 shares of its common stock in connection with the holders' conversion of the corporation's outstanding convertible subordinated debentures due 2019 prior to the redemption date. As a result of the conversion, second quarter interest expense decreased by approximately $600,000, with full year interest savings expected to be approximately $2,900,000. As previously discussed, the conversion/redemption of the convertible debentures will have no impact on fully diluted earnings per share.

Mr. Spainhour continued, "We remain comfortable with current earnings guidance for the fall season in the range of $.95$.99 per share on a diluted basis, which represents a 12 to 17 percent increase over the same period last year, and we continue to project third and fourth quarter earnings per share in the range of $.48$.50 and $.47$.49, respectively, and full year guidance in the range of $1.79$1.83 per share on a diluted basis."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of August were up approximately 21 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were up approximately 23 percent for Ann Taylor and up approximately 13 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The increase at Ann Taylor is primarily due to earlier planned receipts of September product. The increase at Ann Taylor Loft is primarily due to higher in transit inventories which include inventory for the planned opening of new stores in the fall.

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated October 7, 2004. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

NEWS RELEASE
 
142 WEST 57
TH
STREET NEW YORK, N.Y. 10019
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today total net sales for the five-week period ended October 2, 2004 increased 16.9 percent to $187,667,000 over total net sales of $160,484,000 for the five-week period ended October 4, 2003. By division, net sales were $79,722,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $83,580,000 last year, and $89,969,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $64,488,000 last year.
New York, New York, October 7, 2004
 
Comparable store sales increased 1.4 percent for the period, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 6.9 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal September 2004 were down 5.1 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 0.8 percent increase last year, and up 10.2 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 17.1 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "Ann Taylor Loft experienced continued strong momentum through September, marking its 18
th
consecutive month of positive comparable store sales. All separates, petites, jackets, outerwear and fashion accessories delivered double-digit comparable increases. Fashion newness' such as cropped pants, bold patterns, colorful outerwear, item jackets, shrugs, ponchos, wraps and jewelry, were standouts. The Ann Taylor division did not meet our internal expectations, which resulted in greater promotional activity. The miss was primarily due to sweaters, where our offering was too narrow and too deep, and pants, where sales increased over last year yet were not in line with our inventory levels. Our client reacted favorably to suits, jackets, woven tops and a variety of accessories such as handbags and silk wraps."
 
The Company estimates that Hurricanes Frances, Ivan and Jeanne reduced September sales by approximately $3,000,000. The stores that were impacted represented 8% of total stores.
 
Mr. Spainhour continued, "The initial sales level that we saw at Ann Taylor in September did not build through the balance of the month, which may be partly attributable to increasing macroeconomic concerns surrounding the economy. In light of this, our expectation for October is for comparable store sales to be in the low to mid single-digit positive range for both divisions. We are revising our earnings guidance for the third quarter to the range of $0.28 - $0.32 per share on a diluted basis, down from our previous guidance of $0.48 - $0.50."

"In the fourth quarter, we will anniversary and evolve the holiday gifting campaign that was so successful for us last year. The penetration rate of giftables will increase to 64 percent at Ann Taylor (versus 61% last year) and 65% at Ann Taylor Loft (versus 62% last year). We believe that our Holiday collections at both Ann Taylor and Loft will be well received. The current sales level at the Ann Taylor division, however, has impacted our fourth quarter estimate. Accordingly, we are revising our earnings guidance for the fourth quarter to the range of $0.42 - $0.44 per share on a diluted basis, down from previous guidance of $0.47 - $0.49. Full year guidance is now in the range of $1.54 - $1.60 per share on a diluted basis."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of September were up approximately 19 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were up approximately 28 percent for Ann Taylor and up approximately 2 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The increase at Ann Taylor was due to lower than anticipated September sales and planned increases in in-store inventory.
 
During the month, the Company opened nine Ann Taylor Loft stores, one Ann Taylor store and one Ann Taylor Factory store. In addition, one existing Ann Taylor store was closed. The total store count at month end was 709, comprised of 355 Ann Taylor stores, 318 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 36 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total square footage at the end of fiscal September 2004 increased 13.6 percent over the same period last year.
 
For the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 2, 2004, the Company's net sales totaled $1,208,858,000, up 20 percent from $1,007,304,000 for the same period in fiscal 2003. By division, net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were $563,990,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $553,630,000 last year, and $538,311,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $365,814,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period increased 6.6 percent over the same period last year. Comparable store sales by division for the fiscal year-to-date period were up 0.3 percent for Ann Taylor and up 17.2 percent for Ann Taylor Loft.
 
In September, the Company purchased 400,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $9,700,000, bringing the total repurchased during fiscal 2004 to 4,090,000 shares. Of the $100,000,000 securities repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors on August 10
th
, approximately $63,000,000 remains.
 
Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 709 stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also Online Stores at and as of October 2, 2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today total net sales for the four-week period ended October 30, 2004 increased 19.5 percent to $157,387,000 over total net sales of $131,727,000 for the four-week period ended November 1, 2003. By division, net sales were $70,710,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $70,811,000 last year, and $71,064,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $51,140,000 last year.
New York, New York, November 4, 2004
 
Comparable store sales increased 6.2 percent for the period, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 3.9 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal October 2004 were down 0.4 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 0.2 percent decrease last year, and up 13.1 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 14.1 percent increase last year.
 
For the third quarter of fiscal 2004, total net sales were $460,365,000, up 16.0 percent from $396,807,000 for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the third quarter were $199,615,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $207,077,000 last year, and $215,447,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $157,023,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were up 1.4 percent compared to a 6.2 percent increase for the third quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the third quarter were down 4.2 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 1.9 percent increase last year, and up 9.2 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 13.4 increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "Ann Taylor Loft delivered its 19
th
consecutive month of positive comparable store sales and is enjoying strong full-price momentum going into the fourth quarter. All categories of tops, separates, outerwear, fashion accessories and petites delivered strong comparable results. New fashion, strong marketing and the continued store-attributing strategy drove exceptional performance in this division. Looking forward, we expect Loft to continue to execute well on all fronts, and as such, we expect Loft's fourth quarter comparable store sales to be mid single-digit positive."
 
"In the Ann Taylor division, the weak sales trend that we experienced in September continued through October. Because of this, we were more promotional
Page 2 of 3
 
 
than we had planned, including the 25% off already-reduced merchandise promotion which ran at the end of the month, so we would be better positioned to receive our holiday product in November."
 
"As a result of the extensive promotional activity at Ann Taylor, we now expect our third quarter earnings per share to be $0.20 on a diluted basis, down from our previous estimate of $0.28 - $0.32 per share. For the fourth quarter, comparable store sales are expected to be in the low single-digit positive range, with Ann Taylor expected to be flat to low single-digit negative. We currently estimate fourth quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.28 - $0.32 on a diluted basis versus previous guidance of $0.42 - $0.44. Full year guidance is now in the range of $1.32 - $1.36 per share on a diluted basis."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of October were up approximately 12 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were up approximately 19 percent for Ann Taylor and up approximately 7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The increase at Ann Taylor was due to lower than anticipated October sales and planned increases in in-store inventory.
 
During the month, the Company opened 15 Ann Taylor Loft stores and three Ann Taylor stores. The total store count at month end was 727, comprised of 358 Ann Taylor stores, 333 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 36 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total square footage at the end of fiscal October 2004 increased 14.5 percent over the same period last year.
 
For the fiscal year-to-date period ended October 30, 2004, the Company's net sales totaled $1,366,245,000 up 19.9 percent from $1,139,031,000 for the same period in fiscal 2003. By division, net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were $634,700,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $624,441,000 last year, and $609,375,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $416,954,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period increased 6.6 percent over the same period last year. Comparable store sales by division for the fiscal year-to-date period were up 0.2 percent for Ann Taylor and up 16.7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft.
 
In October, the Company purchased 600,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $13,000,000, bringing the total repurchased during fiscal 2004 to 4,690,000 shares. Of the $100,000,000 securities repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors on August 10
th
, approximately $50,000,000 remains.
 
Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 727 stores in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also Online Stores at and as of October 30, 2004.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 8, 2004  J. Patrick Spainhour, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, of AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN), today announced the appointment of Kay Krill as President of the Company and a member of its Board of Directors.
 
Ms. Krill has been with the Ann Taylor Corporation since 1994, when she joined as Merchandising Vice President of separates, suits, dresses and petites at Ann Taylor Stores. She has led the management team of the Company's Ann Taylor Loft division since its formation as a stand-alone concept in 1996, and was appointed President of the division in 2001. In that role, she has established Ann Taylor Loft as one of the industry's most successful, consistent and fastest growing retail apparel concepts. In her new position, Ms. Krill will have oversight responsibility for all three of the Company's concepts, Ann Taylor Stores, Ann Taylor Loft, and Ann Taylor Factory Stores, as well as all aspects of marketing.
 
"We are delighted to promote Kay to a position where we can leverage her talents and expertise across all of our businesses," said Mr. Spainhour. "Kay is not only a skilled merchant with a keen ability to anticipate the needs and desires of the client, but an innovative and results-driven leader who has built and nurtured Loft since its inception, developing product strategies to deliver continually fresh and appealing assortments, while managing all aspects of Loft with great discipline and efficiency. In addition to these achievements she has built a superior senior management team, with an average tenure of approximately eight years. With this team in place, Kay is well positioned to see that Loft continues to build on its impressive record of success, as well as to apply her proven skills to improving performance and consistency at Ann Taylor Stores and overseeing the continued development of our Factory concept."
 
Ms. Krill will assume her new responsibilities as the Company's President effective immediately, and will continue to have direct management responsibility for Ann Taylor Loft until her replacement at Loft is named.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today net income for the third quarter ended October 30, 2004 of $14,245,000, or $0.20 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 71.6 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $30,305,000, or $0.42 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 74.0 million shares outstanding) in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 third quarter earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2004.
NEW YORK, NEW YORK, November 10, 2004
 
As previously reported, total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $460,365,000, up 16.0 percent from $396,807,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. By division, third quarter net sales were $199,615,000 for Ann Taylor, down from $207,077,000 for the same period last year, and $215,447,000 for Ann Taylor Loft, up from $157,023,000 for the same period last year. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2004 increased 1.4 percent, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 6.2 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Comparable store sales by division for the quarter were down 4.2 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 1.9 percent increase last year, and up 9.2 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 13.4 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "We are thrilled with the performance of Ann Taylor Loft, which in October delivered its 19th consecutive month of positive comparable store sales and enjoyed strong full-price sales in the third quarter. We expect Loft's fourth quarter comparable store sales to be mid single-digit positive."
 
Mr. Spainhour continued, "The Ann Taylor division did not meet our expectations for the third quarter, which resulted in higher than anticipated promotional activity and a corresponding negative impact on gross margin and earnings. Our fourth quarter is primarily about gift-giving, and we have evolved last year's successful gift-giving strategy, rolling it out to more stores and launching a more colorful and joyful marketing campaign designed to resonate with our client's mindset this time of year."
 
"We currently expect fourth quarter comparable store sales to be in the low single-digit positive range, with Ann Taylor expected to be flat to low single-digit negative. We estimate fourth quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.28 - $0.32 on a diluted basis. Full year guidance is now in the range of $1.32 - $1.36 per share on a diluted basis."
 
Total inventory levels at cost at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were up 12 percent on a per square foot basis compared to last year. By division, inventory levels at cost on a per square foot basis were up approximately 19 percent for Ann Taylor and up approximately 7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The increase at Ann Taylor was due to lower than anticipated sales as well as planned increases in in-store inventory.
 
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 51.0 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 57.7 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased promotional activity at Ann Taylor.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 were $211,470,000, or 45.9 percent of net sales, compared to $177,356,000, or 44.7 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher marketing costs, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for management performance bonus.

AYLOR    
 
Operating profit was 5.1 percent of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 13.0 percent of net sales in the third quarter of last year.
 
During the third fiscal quarter, the Company opened four Ann Taylor stores, 35 Ann Taylor Loft stores and two Ann Taylor Factory stores. Additionally, one existing Ann Taylor store was closed. The total store count at the end of the third quarter was 727, comprised of 358 Ann Taylor stores, 333 Ann Taylor Loft stores, and 36 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
 
Total store square footage increased 14.5 percent to 4,125,000 square feet as of October 30, 2004, from 3,603,000 square feet at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Total square footage by division at the end of the third quarter was 1,867,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 1,947,000 square feet for Ann Taylor Loft.
 
For the fiscal year-to-date period ending October 30, 2004, the Company's net income was $76,224,000, or $1.05 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 73.7 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $69,410,000, or $0.99 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.7 million shares outstanding) for the same period last year. Fiscal 2003 year-to-date earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2004.
 
Fiscal year-to-date net sales totaled $1,366,245,000, up 19.9 percent from $1,139,031,000 for the fiscal year-to-date period ended November 1, 2003. By division, net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were $634,700,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $624,441,000 last year, and $609,375,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $416,954,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period increased 6.6 percent over the same period last year. Comparable store sales by division were up 0.2 percent for Ann Taylor and up 16.7 percent for Ann Taylor Loft.
 
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period ending October 30, 2004 was 54.0 percent, compared to 54.5 percent for the same period last year.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 44.7 percent for the fiscal 2004 year-to-date period compared to 44.1 percent for the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher marketing costs, partially offset by increased leverage on fixed expenses as a result of higher comparable store sales.
 
During the third quarter of fiscal 2004, the Company repurchased 2,540,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $60,000,000, bringing the total repurchased during fiscal 2004 to 4,690,000 shares. To date, the Company has utilized approximately $50,000,000 of the $100,000,000 authorized by its Board of Directors on August 10, 2004.

ITEM 7.01. REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.
 
AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated December 2, 2004. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today total net sales for the four-week period ended November 27, 2004 increased 4.7 percent to $146,186,000 over total net sales of $139,639,000 for the four-week period ended November 29, 2003. By division, net sales were $62,992,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $74,964,000 last year, and $65,954,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $52,743,000 last year.
New York, New York, December 2, 2004
 
Comparable store sales decreased 8.3 percent for the period, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 9.6 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal November 2004 were down 16.3 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 7.3 percent increase last year, and up 0.8 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 14.9 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "November was a very challenging month for the Ann Taylor Corporation, with traffic for both divisions decreasing approximately 4 percent. The Ann Taylor division was weak throughout the month, with all regions experiencing lackluster sales. We were heavily promotional with our fall merchandise as planned, but because our holiday assortment was not as well received as anticipated, we accelerated the promotional cadence on select categories as well. Ivory and neutral product sold well, however our color offering was not well received. The month started off slowly for Ann Taylor Loft, but improved as the month progressed, with tops, dresses, fashion accessories, sleepwear and baby driving 70% of total sales. Regionally, hot and warm stores performed very well versus spotty performance in the Northeast."
 
"In light of this prolonged weakness at Ann Taylor and the flat performance at Ann Taylor Loft in November, we now estimate that fourth quarter comparable store sales will be mid to high single-digit negative with Ann Taylor low double-digit negative and Ann Taylor Loft low single-digit positive. Estimated fourth quarter earnings per share guidance is revised to $0.00  $0.04 on a diluted basis versus $0.28  $0.32. Full year earnings per share guidance is now $1.04  $1.08 on a diluted basis versus $1.32  $1.36."
,
 
Total inventory levels at the end of November were up approximately 18 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were up approximately 16 percent at Ann Taylor and up approximately 18 percent at Ann Taylor Loft. The increase at Ann Taylor

was due to lower than anticipated November sales and a planned increase in in-store inventory levels. The increase at Ann Taylor Loft was due to higher in-transit inventory levels and a planned increase in in-store inventory levels.
 
During the month, the Company opened nine Ann Taylor Loft stores and four Ann Taylor stores, and closed one existing Ann Taylor Store. The total store count at month end was 739, comprised of 361 Ann Taylor stores, 342 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 36 Ann Taylor Factory stores.

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated January 6, 2005. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today total net sales for the five-week period ended January 1, 2005 increased 11.1 percent to $239,924,000 over total net sales of $215,922,000 for the five-week period ended January 3, 2004. By division, net sales were $110,165,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $118,058,000 last year, and $107,436,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $82,758,000 last year.
New York, New York, January 6, 2005
 
Comparable store sales decreased 1.5 percent for the period, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 26.2 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal December 2004 were down 7.4 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 28.8 percent increase last year, and up 6.3 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 25.4 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "Sales at the Ann Taylor division were better than we had anticipated given November's weak performance, with most of the improvement coming in week five. We continued to be promotional throughout the month, as we stated we would be. Ann Taylor Loft's performance was in line with our expectations, and as with the Ann Taylor division, week five was particularly strong. We were again pleased with the performance of Loft's new categories, baby and sleepwear, and jewelry and accessories continued to deliver strong results. Regionally, Loft's hot and warm stores performed well, particularly in the Southeast, and the Northeast continued to be challenging."
 
"We expect January comparable store sales to be low single-digit positive for both divisions, and we remain comfortable with our previously stated fourth quarter earnings per share guidance of $0.00 - $0.04 on a diluted basis and full year earnings per share guidance of $1.04 - $1.08 on a diluted basis."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of December were up approximately 12 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year, consistent across both divisions. The increase was primarily due to planned increases in both in-store inventory levels and higher in-transit inventory levels at both divisions.
 
During the month, the Company opened one Ann Taylor Loft store.

ITEM 2.02. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.
 
On February 11, 2005, AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued two news releases with respect to updated guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. These news releases are attached as Exhibits 99.1 and 99.2 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today provided updated fourth quarter 2004 guidance, commented on its accounting treatment for leasing transactions and discussed its first quarter 2005 outlook.
New York, New York, February 11, 2005
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "As we stated last week, Ann Taylor Loft delivered comparable store sales growth of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter on top of a very strong 20.0 percent positive increase the prior year. Loft's casual business was well received and early reads on spring product are positive. For the Ann Taylor division, the fourth quarter was more challenging with a 7.2 percent comparable store sales decline versus a 14.4 percent increase in the prior year. Fall merchandise was not well received at the Ann Taylor division from the start, and as we entered the holiday season, it remained heavily promotional. Additionally, our holiday merchandise was not as well received as we had expected and as a result, our promotional cadence was accelerated throughout the quarter. While our January POS promotion started the month with strong volume, it waned throughout the month, negatively impacting fourth quarter earnings by more than we had originally anticipated," he added.
 
During the fourth quarter, the Company made some organizational changes to improve performance, which are expected to generate annualized savings of approximately $3 million.As a result of these actions, the Company will record a severance charge of approximately $3 million (approximately $0.03 per share on a diluted basis) in the fourth quarter.
 
In connection with its review of lease accounting practices discussed below, the Company has determined to record rent expense in 2004 with respect to its corporate office space at Times Square Tower in New York City. The resulting pre-tax charge which was not contemplated in previous guidance is approximately $7 million (approximately $0.06 per share on a diluted basis) and will be recorded in the fourth quarter.
Including the above charges, the Company estimates that it will record a fourth quarter net loss in the range of $0.14 - $0.18 per share on a diluted basis versus previous guidance of $0.00 - $0.04 and full year earnings per share of $0.89 - $0.93 on a diluted basis versus previous guidance of $1.04 - $1.08.
 
Accounting for Leasing Transactions
 
Like other retail companies, Ann Taylor is reviewing its accounting practices with respect to leasing transactions. Based on an internal review and consultations with its independent auditors, the Company has determined to correct an error in its practices in this area and will record construction allowances as deferred credits, which will be amortized as a reduction of rent expense. Historically, these allowances have been classified on the Company's balance sheet as reductions of property and equipment. The Company has not yet reached a final decision as to whether this change will require a restatement of prior period financial statements, nor as to the affected periods, but believes that a restatement of its balance sheet and cash flow statements for certain periods is likely. This change will not affect the income statement classification of these amounts as both depreciation and rent expense are presented in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income, nor will it impact historical or current period net income as these amounts are amortized over the life of the leases. This change will also have no impact on the Company's historical or future cash flow or the timing of payments under the leases.
 
The Company is reviewing all other aspects of its lease accounting practices to determine if further corrections are necessary and expects to complete its review and make its final determination about the impact of these corrections in connection with the audit of its 2004 financial statements.
 
Outlook
 
"We have continued to implement the processes and disciplines that we identified as necessary to reinvigorate the Ann Taylor Stores brand," stated Mr. Spainhour. "With Kay Krill, President of Ann Taylor, leading a team of brand-experienced people in the right roles, we are making good progress toward restoring the Ann Taylor heritage and accomplishing our goal of providing the updated classic product that our client expects," he concluded.
Comparable Store Sales
 
For the first quarter, the Company currently expects to achieve comparable store sales results in the low single-digit negative to flat range, with Ann Taylor expected to be in the mid to high single-digit negative range and Ann Taylor Loft expected to be in the low to mid single-digit positive range. February comparable store sales are expected to be high single-digit negative overall, with Ann Taylor expected to be mid-teen negative and Ann Taylor Loft expected to be in the low single-digit positive range.
 
Margins
 
For the first quarter, the Company expects to see continued pressure in its gross margin, specifically at the Ann Taylor division. Partially offsetting the pressure in gross margin is the anticipated decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales, as marketing as a percentage of net sales at the Ann Taylor division is expected to decline.
 
Capital Expenditures
 
For fiscal 2005, capital expenditures are planned at approximately $160 - $170 million, which includes approximately $95 - $97 million for new store build outs, $30 - $33 million for existing store renovations and maintenance, $20 - $22 million for information technology initiatives, and $15 - $18 million for corporate office and general corporate purposes. In accordance with the Company's new accounting practice, included in the $95 - $97 million for new store build outs is approximately $45 million now classified as a deferred credit as opposed to a reduction in new store build outs.
 
Inventory
 
For the first quarter, the Company expects total inventory levels to be up on average approximately 10 percent on a per-square foot basis compared to last year's first quarter, which itself was down on average five percent from the prior year.
 
New Store Openings
 
During fiscal 2005, the Company plans to open approximately 85 - 100 stores comprised of approximately 8 - 10 Ann Taylor stores, approximately 70 - 75 Ann Taylor Loft stores and approximately 10 - 15 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total Company square footage is projected to increase approximately 14 percent in fiscal 2005. This represents an approximate 2 percent divisional square footage increase for Ann Taylor, and an approximate 20 percent divisional square footage increase for Ann Taylor Loft. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the Company plans to open three new Ann Taylor stores and 13 new Ann Taylor Loft stores.
Earnings Per Share
 
"Based on the above financial assumptions and planned store growth, we project earnings per share on a diluted basis for the first quarter in the range of $0.27 - $0.30," concluded Mr. Spainhour.

Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On March 17, 2005, AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (the "Company") issued a press release announcing that in connection with the Company's succession planning, J. Patrick Spainhour has decided to retire and resign his position as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and all other direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company, effective September 30, 2005 (the "Retirement Date"). Kay Krill, the Company's current President and a member of the Board will become the Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective as of the Retirement Date.
 
A copy of the press release announcing the foregoing is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
 
In connection with Mr. Spainhour's resignation, the Company and Mr. Spainhour have executed a letter agreement, dated March 16, 2005 (the "Letter Agreement"). The Letter Agreement provides that, following his retirement, Mr. Spainhour will receive, subject to the execution of a release waiving all claims Mr. Spainhour may have against the Company, its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, successors and assigns, (i) payment of an amount equal to $2,229,261 (representing 15 months salary and average bonus) during a fifteen month period beginning on the Retirement Date and ending on December 31, 2006 (the "Compensation Period"), (ii) a pro-rata portion of the 2005 fiscal year bonus, if any, that he would have received under the Company's Management Performance Compensation Plan had his employment not terminated, based on the portion of fiscal year 2005 that Mr. Spainhour was employed by the Company (payable at the time, if any, that active employees in such plan are paid), (iii) continuation of medical and life insurance coverage during the Compensation Period, and (iv) cash incentive payments, if any, that he would have received with respect to the fiscal 2003-2005 performance cycle under the Company's Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan (payable at the time, if any, that active employees in such plan are paid).
 
As of the effective date of the release to be executed by Mr. Spainhour in connection with his retirement, Mr. Spainhour's stock options will become fully vested and remain outstanding until 90 days following the end of the Compensation Period (or the normal expiration date of the options, if earlier) in accordance with their terms. Any options remaining unexercised after such date (or the normal expiration date of the option, if earlier) shall be cancelled at such time. In addition, restricted stock awards held by Mr. Spainhour on the Retirement Date will vest on the effective date of the release to be executed by Mr. Spainhour.
 
As of the Retirement Date, the Letter Agreement will supercede Mr. Spainhour's employment agreement with the Company and provides that, other than the obligation to continue to indemnify Mr. Spainhour with respect to services performed during the term of his employment, no further benefits will be paid thereunder. Mr. Spainhour, however, will remain subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions contained in his employment agreement through the Compensation Period. In the event Mr. Spainhour violates either of these provisions or takes any action which materially violates the terms of the Letter Agreement, he immediately forfeits his right to any future payments or any benefits under the Letter Agreement,
and all options will no longer be exercisable and will be cancelled immediately. Mr. Spainhour further agrees not to take any action that is intended to damage the business or reputation of the Company or any of its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, successors and assigns, or that interferes with, impairs or disrupts the normal operations of the Company or any of its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, successors and assigns. Until the Retirement Date, Mr. Spainhour's employment agreement will remain in full force and effect.
 
Item 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
 
AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated March 17, 2005. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 4.02. Non-Reliance On Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.
 
(a) As previously disclosed in its February 11, 2005 press release, the Company recently reviewed its lease accounting practices in light of the views expressed by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in a letter issued to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants on February 7, 2005. As reported in the Press Release attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto, like many other retail companies, the Company will correct the way it accounts for leases, specifically the accounting for free rent periods and tenant allowances. The Company will also correct the way in which it classified the proceeds from the February 2002 sale of its proprietary credit card portfolio on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and reclassify auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
Management, in consultation with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, concluded on March 15, 2005 that the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, and the three interim quarters of fiscal year 2004, should be restated, and that such previously filed financial statements should no longer be relied upon. Management and the Audit Committee discussed these matters with its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP.
 
The Company will reflect a liability for the unamortized portion of construction allowances and other lease concessions rather than treat such amount as a reduction to property and equipment on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Construction allowances in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows will be presented within operating activities, rather than as a reduction of capital expenditures in investing activities. The change in the Company's lease accounting practices for construction allowances will not affect the income statement classification of these amounts as both depreciation and rent expense are presented in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, nor will it impact historical or current period net income as these amounts are amortized over the life of the leases. This change will also have no impact on the Company's historical or future cash payments under the leases.
With respect to free rent periods, the Company had previously recorded straight-line rent expense beginning on the store opening date, without considering the construction build-out period. It will now recognize straight-line rent expense when the Company takes possession of or controls the use of the space. The resulting restatement adjustments will be recorded as rent expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income and deferred rent expense in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There will be no impact on "net cash provided by operating activities" during any of the periods restated as a result of the revised accounting for lease expenses during build-out periods.
 
In addition, the Company had previously classified the proceeds from the sale of its proprietary credit card portfolio as an investing activity in its Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2003. The Company will restate such Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to reflect the proceeds from the sale as an operating activity.
 
Investments in auction rate securities have been reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods restated. The reclassification was effected as the securities had stated maturities beyond three months but are priced and traded as short-term instruments due to the liquidity provided through the interest rate reset mechanism of 28 or 35 days. This reclassification also resulted in changes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Net sales (purchases) of short-term investments previously presented within cash and cash equivalents have been reclassified as an investing activity within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
 
The Company intends to restate its consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003 included in its filing on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005. In addition, the Company intends to amend its Forms 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended May 1, 2004, July 31, 2004 and October 30, 2004 to reflect the restatement.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported preliminary, unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2004, which ended January 29, 2005. Results for fourth quarter 2003 and fiscal year 2003, which ended January 31, 2004, have been restated in connection with the Company's review of lease accounting transactions.
NEW YORK, NEW YORK, March 17, 2005
 
Preliminary Fourth Quarter Results
 
For the fourth quarter ended January 29, 2005, the Company recorded a preliminary net loss of $12,468,000, or $0.18 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 70.7 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $31,751,000, or $0.43 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 74.6 million shares outstanding) for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2004. Fourth quarter 2004 results include previously announced charges of approximately $3.0 million, or $0.03 per share on a diluted basis, associated with severance and approximately $7.0 million, or $0.06 per share on a diluted basis, related to the recording of rent expense with respect to its corporate office space at Times Square Tower in New York City. In addition, the fourth quarter 2004 results include approximately $2.7 million, or $0.02 per share on a diluted basis, of additional pension expense. Since the impact of the adjustment to each of the prior-period financial statements was not material, the Company recorded this catch-up pension adjustment, which is subject to final review and audit, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2003 fourth quarter earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2004.
 
As previously reported, total net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $487,338,000, up 8.6 percent from $448,677,000 for the same period last year. By division, fourth quarter net sales were $220,165,000 for Ann Taylor, compared to $243,414,000 for the same period last year, and $217,181,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT, compared to $171,847,000 for the same period last year. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 decreased 4.0 percent, compared to a 15.5 percent increase last year. By division, comparable store sales for the quarter were down 10.1 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 14.4 percent increase last year, and up 3.2 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 20.0 percent increase last year.

Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 43.0 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to 54.8 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is due to a combination of higher average unit costs, lower full price sales and lower margin rates achieved on both full-price and non-full price sales, particularly at Ann Taylor.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were $230,867,000, or 47.4 percent of net sales, compared to $191,588,000, or 42.7 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher tenancy, marketing, severance and pension costs partially offset by a decrease in the provision for management performance bonuses.
 
The Company posted a preliminary operating loss of $21,523,000, or 4.4 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, compared to operating income of $54,305,000, or 12.1 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of last year.
 
During the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company opened four Ann Taylor stores and ten Ann Taylor LOFT stores. Additionally, three existing Ann Taylor stores were closed. The total store count at the end of the fourth quarter was 738, comprised of 359 Ann Taylor stores, 343 Ann Taylor LOFT stores, and 36 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
 
Total store square footage increased 14.7 percent to 4,202,000 square feet as of January 29, 2005, from 3,662,000 square feet as of January 31, 2004. Total square footage by division at the end of the fourth quarter was 1,885,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 2,005,000 square feet for Ann Taylor LOFT.
 
Preliminary Fiscal Year Results
 
For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2005, the Company reported preliminary net income of $63,277,000, or $.88 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.9 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $100,723,000, or $1.42 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 73.1 million shares outstanding) for the same period last year. Fiscal 2003 year-to-date earnings per share and shares outstanding have been restated for the effect of the 3-for-2 stock split that occurred in May 2004.
 
Fiscal year net sales totaled $1,853,583,000, up 16.7 percent from $1,587,708,000 for the same period in fiscal 2003. By division, net sales for the fiscal year were $854,865,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $867,855,000 last year, and $826,556,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $588,801,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year increased 3.6 percent compared to a 5.3 percent increase last year. Comparable store sales by division for the fiscal year were down 2.7 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 3.2 percent increase last year and up 12.8 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 9.4 percent increase last year.

Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the fiscal year was 51.1 percent, compared to 54.5 percent for the same period last year. The decrease is primarily due to lower full-price sales and gross margin rates, particularly at Ann Taylor.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 45.5 percent for the fiscal year compared to 43.8 percent for the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher marketing and severance costs, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for management performance bonuses.
 
The Company posted preliminary operating income of $104,958,000, or 5.7 percent of net sales in fiscal 2004, compared to $171,287,000, or 10.8 percent of net sales in fiscal 2003.
 
At the end of fiscal 2004, the Company had no debt, and had no borrowings outstanding under its $175,000,000 credit facility at any time during fiscal 2004.
 
During the fiscal year, the Company repurchased 4,690,000 shares of its common stock. The Company made no repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2004. To date, the Company has utilized approximately $50,000,000 of the $100,000,000 authorized by its Board of Directors on August 11, 2004.
 
For the first quarter of 2005, total inventory levels are expected to be up on average approximately 10 to 15 percent on a per-square foot basis compared to last year's first quarter, which itself was down on average five percent from the prior year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "While our results in fiscal 2004 were disappointing, we are now well along in implementing a series of decisive actions to strengthen our Ann Taylor Stores division. Under a revamped management structure, we are refocusing on the needs and preferences of our core Ann Taylor client, creating a stronger infrastructure to manage our business, and enhancing our systems and processes to institute increased discipline around our entire supply chain, from design, to sourcing, to distribution."
 
"I am pleased to note that these actions are already producing the desired results, and that we expect to deliver on our previously announced first quarter earnings guidance of $0.27 - $0.30 per share on a diluted basis. This expectation is based upon our previously reported February sales and the tone of our business thus far in March, and we continue to anticipate first quarter comparable store sales in the low single-digit negative to flat range, with Ann Taylor Stores expected to be in the mid to high single-digit negative range and Ann Taylor LOFT expected to be in the low to mid single-digit positive range."

Kay Krill, Ann Taylor President, added, "As we look ahead in 2005, we know that we can and will produce better results. Both Ann Taylor Stores and Ann Taylor LOFT have outstanding long-term potential and the strong teams we have in place in these businesses are now executing detailed strategic plans to ensure we are maximizing the many opportunities inherent in each brand. We expect to see these efforts delivering initial results in the third quarter at the Ann Taylor division and expect LOFT to gain strength as we progress through the year," she concluded.
 
Leadership Succession Plans
 
Mr. Spainhour also said that he and the Board have agreed that this is an appropriate time to proceed with an orderly transition in senior management. "One of the most important responsibilities of a Chief Executive Officer is to ensure a seamless and smooth transfer to the next generation of managers," stated Mr. Spainhour. "That is why the Board and I have put together a timetable that ensures that the Company will continue to move forward without any distraction."
 
"In the short time that Kay has been President, we are already seeing the initial impact of the actions she and her senior team have implemented. This, coupled with the enormous success she created in the LOFT division, is clear evidence that she is ready and willing to assume additional responsibilities. Over the next several months, Kay and I will work closely together to ensure that the Company is well positioned to capitalize on the progress made thus far at Ann Taylor, to continue to evolve LOFT by setting new strategies and initiatives, and to move the Company as a whole forward."
 
Over the next several months, while Ms. Krill and her team continue to focus on product, including merchandising and design, store operations and marketing, Mr. Spainhour will continue with his current responsibilities, providing support to Ms. Krill through the transition period. Ms. Krill will become CEO as of October 2005.
 
The Company also said that over the next several months, it will begin a search for a Chief Operating Officer, and will consider candidates from within and outside the Company.
 
In November 2004, Ms. Krill was named President of AnnTaylor Stores Corporation, with oversight responsibility for all three of the Company's concepts, Ann Taylor Stores, Ann Taylor LOFT, and Ann Taylor Factory Stores. Ms. Krill joined the Corporation in 1994 as Vice President of Merchandising, Separates, Suits, Dresses and Petites for Ann Taylor, and subsequently led the management team of the LOFT division, which she established as one of the industry's most successful, consistent and fastest growing retail apparel concepts.
 
Accounting for Leasing Transactions
 
On February 7, 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued a letter to the American Institute of Certified

Public Accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's management subsequently initiated a review of its lease-related accounting practices and determined that the manner in which it accounts for construction allowances and the period over which it recognizes rent expense were not in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Technical Bulletin No. 88-1 "Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases" ("FTB No. 88-1").
 
With respect to construction allowances, FTB No. 88-1 states that lease incentives should be treated by the lessee as a reduction of rental expense and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in accordance with FTB No. 85-3 "Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases". Accordingly, the Company established liabilities (current and long-term) for the unamortized portion of construction allowances (deferred lease incentives) which are amortized over the lease term on a straight-line basis as a reduction of rent expense. The Company had previously recorded these allowances as a reduction of property and equipment and amortized them over the lease term as a reduction of depreciation expense.
 
In determining the proper period over which to recognize rent expense with free rent periods and/or rent escalation, FTB No. 88-1 considers the lessee's possession or right to control the physical use of the property, and requires that straight-line rent expense begin when the lessee takes possession of or controls the use of the space. The Company had previously recorded straight-line rent expense beginning on the store opening date, as the Company believed that "possession" under FTB No. 88-1 occurred on the date it took physical control of the space through occupancy, without considering the construction build-out period.
 
The impact of the construction allowance restatement on the Company's January 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet was an increase in property and equipment, net of approximately $96.2 million, an increase in accrued tenancy of approximately $16.0 million and an increase in deferred lease costs of approximately $80.2 million. The impact of the rent expense restatement on the Company's January 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet was an increase in deferred taxes of approximately $8.4 million, an increase in short-term deferred rent of approximately $4.0 million, an increase in long-term deferred rent of approximately $16.2 million and a decrease in retained earnings of approximately $11.8 million.
 
The impact of the construction allowance restatement on the Company's January 31, 2004 consolidated cash flow was an increase in net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $22.3 million, and a decrease in net cash provided by investing activities of approximately $22.3 million. The rent expense restatement had no impact on net cash provided by operating activities.
 
The impact of the rent expense restatement on the Company's consolidated statements of income for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2003 was not material. There is no impact of the construction allowance restatement on the Company's consolidated statements of income for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2003.

Annual Incentive Compensation Awards Earned in 2004
 
. On March 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee certified that the performance goals under the Company's Management Performance Compensation Plan ("Performance Compensation Plan") for fiscal year 2004, which were based on certain company-wide net income goals and/or divisional net sales and operating income goals for that period, were achieved, and the Compensation Committee approved annual cash bonus awards earned during 2004 to the current executive officers who were listed as named executive officers in the Company's 2004 proxy statement as follows: J. Patrick Spainhour ($167,428), Kay Krill ($805,600), Dwight Meyer ($103,704) and James Smith ($45,702).
Management Performance Compensation Plan
 
. The Compensation Committee also certified that the performance target for the 2002-2004 cycle of the Company's Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan, which was based on cumulative earnings per share, was achieved and the Compensation Committee approved cash awards for that cycle to the current executive officers who were listed as named executive officers in the Company's 2004 proxy statement in the following amounts: J. Patrick Spainhour ($684,000), Kay Krill ($684,000), Dwight Meyer ($211,680) and James Smith ($159,840).
Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan
 
Adoption of Performance Measures for Fiscal 2005
 
On March 15, 2005, the Compensation Committee established performance goals and target award percentages for each participant eligible to earn cash bonuses under the Performance Compensation Plan and the 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan.
 
The fiscal year 2005 bonuses payable to the named executive officers under the Performance Compensation Plan will be based on the achievement of certain company-wide net income goals and/or divisional net sales and operating income goals approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee also designated a three-year performance target that must be achieved for the 2005-2007 three-year cycle in order for incentive compensation to be paid under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan with respect to that cycle. The performance goals for the 2005-2007 cycle are based on a combination of return on invested capital and comparable store sales.
 
Under the Performance Compensation Plan, a named executive officer's incentive target is a percentage of his/her base salary ranging from 50% to 80% depending on corporate title and responsibilities. Under the 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan, a named executive officer's incentive target is a percentage of his/her base salary ranging from 30% to 50% depending on corporate title and responsibilities. In each case, the actual bonus payments under such awards may be less than or greater than the target amounts or not earned depending on whether and the extent to which the financial performance of the Company (or a division of the Company, as applicable) meets, exceeds or is below the target.
 
Performance Measures established for Restricted Stock
 
The Compensation Committee established that the restrictions on the 100,000 shares of performance-based restricted stock awarded to Kay Krill on November 4, 2004 shall lapse in three equal annual installments if the Company achieves specified target earnings per share amounts for fiscal years 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated April 7, 2005. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
ITEM 9.01. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today total net sales for the five-week period ended April 2, 2005 increased 12.5 percent to $192,306,000 over total net sales of $170,874,000 for the five-week period ended April 3, 2004. By division, net sales were $79,350,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $81,044,000 last year, and $92,650,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $75,340,000 last year.
New York, New York, April 7, 2005
 
Comparable store sales decreased 1.7 percent for the period, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 12.0 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal March 2005 were down 3.3 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 0.2 percent increase last year, and flat for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 31.6 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, said, "The Company was negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions during March, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Stores in our warm and hot regions were affected to a lesser degree and delivered positive comparable store sales for the month. In addition, the positive impact that we were expecting from the Easter shift, with Easter falling in March this year versus April last year, did not materialize, though we did see a slight pickup toward the end of the month."
 
"As a result, LOFT's comparable store sales were flat compared to last March's record 31.6 percent increase, with casual end-use products such as denim, knit tops, knit dressing, wovens, dresses and sleepwear continuing to do well. At the Ann Taylor division, sweaters and knit camisoles were the best performers, and while our color offering was well received, black was noticeably missing in March. Based on this, we continue to estimate first quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.27 - $0.30 on a diluted basis," he added.
 
As previously announced, the Company expects to move its headquarters to Times Square Tower in New York City this June, and will record a one-time charge of approximately $10 million (approximately $0.08 - $0.09 per share on a diluted basis) in the second quarter in connection with the write-off of the lease on its current headquarters, which expires in September 2006.

Total inventory levels at the end of March were up approximately 17 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year, which itself was down 6 percent from 2003. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were up approximately 14 percent for Ann Taylor and up approximately 20 percent for Ann Taylor Loft. The increase in inventory levels compared to last year at both divisions is attributable to increases in in-store inventory levels due to the Easter shift and higher in-transit inventory levels.
 
During the month, the Company opened two Ann Taylor stores and six Ann Taylor Loft stores. In addition, the Company closed two existing Ann Taylor stores. The total store count at month end was 749, comprised of 360 Ann Taylor stores, 351 Ann Taylor Loft stores and 38 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total square footage at the end of fiscal March 2005 increased 15.2 percent over the same period last year.
 
For the fiscal year-to-date period ended April 2, 2005, the Company's net sales totaled $302,140,000 up 10.3 percent from $273,829,000 for the same period in fiscal 2004. By division, net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were $128,120,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $135,462,000 last year, and $142,605,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $115,943,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were down 3.1 percent compared to a 13.2 percent increase last year. Comparable store sales by division for the fiscal year-to-date period were down 6.6 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 4.9 percent increase last year, and up 0.4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft compared to a 27.7 percent increase last year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today total net sales for the four-week period ended April 30, 2005 increased 9.3 percent to $174,306,000 over total net sales of $159,417,000 for the four-week period ended May 1, 2004. By division, net sales were $77,618,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $77,962,000 last year, and $80,799,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $69,444,000 last year.
New York, New York, May 5, 2005
 
Comparable store sales decreased 3.0 percent for the period, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 9.6 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal April 2005 were down 1.8 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 3.0 percent increase last year, and down 4.8 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 20.5 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, stated, "Following a difficult March, overall business conditions remained challenging in April, causing us to be more promotional at both Ann Taylor and LOFT. In spite of this, at Ann Taylor we were pleased with the progress the team has made and expect further improvements as the year progresses. At LOFT, while our product has been positively received throughout the quarter, the unseasonably cold weather negatively affected overall sales, resulting in higher than anticipated inventory levels. We do, however, expect that inventory levels both at LOFT and at Ann Taylor will decline as the year progresses, especially in the fall season."
 
Kay Krill, Ann Taylor President, stated "At Ann Taylor, our client has recognized a gradual improvement in more brand-appropriate merchandise, though our margin is still pressured by heavier early spring receipts. We had some wins in key areas of the business such as tops, especially sweaters and woven shirts. Our April color palette was focused and well received, and our initial read on early May product is encouraging in even more categories."
 
"LOFT, which has been facing difficult comparable store sales comparisons all quarter, was more promotional than last year due to higher inventory levels. As was the case in both February and March, our client continued to come to us in April for casual separates, denim, knit dressing, knit tops, woven shirts, and relaxed dressing, and we

are seeing clearer differentiation in product response at LOFT versus Ann Taylor from an end-use perspective. "Wear-now" merchandise was also better received during the quarter than weather-sensitive categories such as crop pants, linen separates and sandals," she added.
 
Mr. Spainhour continued, "As a result of higher promotional activity at both divisions, we now expect our first quarter earnings per share to be between $0.23 - $0.25 on a diluted basis, down from our previous estimate of $0.27 - $0.30 per share."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of April were up approximately 8 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 3 percent at Ann Taylor and up approximately 16 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT. At both divisions, a decrease in in-transit inventory levels was offset by higher in-store inventory levels.
 
During the month, the Company opened seven Ann Taylor LOFT stores. The total store count at month end was 756, comprised of 360 Ann Taylor stores, 358 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 38 Ann Taylor Factory stores. Total square footage at the end of fiscal April 2005 increased 14.6 percent over the same period last year.
 
For the first quarter ended April 30, 2005, the Company's net sales totaled $476,446,000, up 10.0 percent from $433,246,000 for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $205,738,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $213,424,000 last year, and $223,404,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $185,387,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were down 3.1 percent, compared to an increase of 11.9 percent for the first quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the first quarter were down 4.9 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 4.2 percent increase last year, and down 1.5 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 24.8 percent increase last year.
 
In April, the Company purchased 300,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $7,400,000. Of the $100,000,000 securities repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors on August 10, 2004, approximately $42,700,000 remains.

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated May 19, 2005. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information included herein and in Exhibit 99.1 is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of the general incorporation language of such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported net income for the first quarter ended April 30, 2005 of $16,971,000, or $0.24 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 71.6 million shares outstanding), compared to a net income of $31,746,000, or $0.43 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 75.1 million shares outstanding) in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Results for first quarter of fiscal 2004, which ended May 1, 2004, have been restated in connection with the Company's review of lease accounting transactions.
New York, New York, May 19, 2005
 
As previously reported, the Company's net sales for the quarter totaled $476,446,000, up 10.0 percent from $433,246,000 for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $205,738,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $213,424,000 last year, and $223,404,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $185,387,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were down 3.1 percent, compared to an increase of 11.9 percent for the first quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the first quarter were down 4.9 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 4.2 percent increase last year, and down 1.5 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 24.8 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "While overall our performance was lower than expected, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in revitalizing our Ann Taylor division and positioning the company as a whole for long-term growth. LOFT had a disappointing first quarter, and while the unseasonably cool spring weather in our Eastern and Western regions worked against us, we realize that we planned and bought LOFT's business too aggressively. Our results should improve as we gradually work through our inventory position and achieve a healthier balance of full-price sales."
 
Kay Krill, Ann Taylor President, stated, "At the Ann Taylor division, we began to see a gradual improvement in our clients' response in late April as more brand-appropriate merchandise was introduced in our stores, and this has continued in May. As we enter the fall season, our product will be even more wardrobable and will reflect a better balance of end-use offerings across wear-to-work, casual, sportswear and special occasion, with an emphasis on wear-to-work and special occasion as that is what our client comes to us for. At LOFT, while the casual end-use category generated our best results and our client came to us throughout the
AT
NN
AYLOR

quarter for more seasonless merchandise and layering pieces, we needed to have a better balance of transitional items that our client could wear immediately, such as more appropriate sleeve lengths and pant lengths versus bare tops and cropped pants. While LOFT's performance did not meet our expectations, I am confident that our team will deliver improved performance as the year progresses as we lower inventory to more appropriate levels, and create a better balance of transitional offerings, especially for the first and third quarters which tend to be more weather sensitive."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of the first quarter were up approximately 8 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 3 percent at Ann Taylor and up approximately 16 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT. At both divisions, a decrease in in-transit inventory levels was offset by higher in-store inventory levels.
 
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 51.0 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to 58.4 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to lower full-price sales and lower margins achieved on non full-price sales, largely due to increased promotional activity at both divisions.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $215,733,000, or 45.2 percent of net sales, compared to $199,325,000, or 46.0 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from a decrease in the provision for management performance bonus and lower marketing costs, partially offset by an overall deleveraging of expenses due to the decrease in comparable store sales.
 
Operating profit was 5.8 percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to 12.4 percent of net sales in the first quarter of last year.
 
During the first fiscal quarter, the Company opened three Ann Taylor stores, 15 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and two Ann Taylor Factory stores. Additionally, two existing Ann Taylor stores were closed. The total store count at month end was 756, comprised of 360 Ann Taylor stores, 358 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 38 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
 
Total store square footage increased 14.6 percent to 4,317,000 square feet as of April 30, 2005, from 3,768,000 square feet as of May 1, 2004. Total square footage by division at the end of the first quarter was 1,894,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 2,095,000 square feet for Ann Taylor LOFT.
 
During the quarter, the Company purchased 300,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $7,400,000. Of the $100,000,000 securities repurchase program approved by the Company's Board of Directors in August 2004, approximately $42,700,000 remains.

As previously announced, the Company expects to complete the move to its new headquarters in Times Square Tower in New York City this June, and will record a one-time write off of approximately $10.1 million (approximately $0.08 - $0.09 per share on a diluted basis) in the second quarter for lease costs related to the existing corporate offices at 142 West 57
th
Street in New York City upon cessation of use. The related lease is scheduled to expire in September 2006.
 
"Our main focus over the next few months will be to take whatever actions are necessary to enable us to be clean from an inventory perspective as we enter the second half of the year," said Mr. Spainhour. "Based on the first quarter and looking forward, we expect to see continued gross margin pressure in the second quarter, with improvements coming in the second half of the year as inventory levels decline each quarter and merchandise margins improve. A majority of the improvement in inventory is expected in the second half and by the end of fiscal 2005, we anticipate consolidated inventory levels per square foot will be down in the low double-digit range. Based on the above assumptions and previously announced planned store growth, we are comfortable that for the full year, we will report results that meet analysts' mean estimate of $1.17 per diluted share, as reported by First Call," he concluded.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today total net sales for the four-week period ended May 28, 2005 increased 4.3 percent to $177,132,000 over total net sales of $169,873,000 for the four-week period ended May 29, 2004. By division, net sales were $74,768,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $78,055,000 last year, and $85,393,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $77,135,000 last year.
New York, New York, June 2, 2005
 
Comparable store sales decreased 7.1 percent for the period, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 9.9 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal May 2005 were down 6.3 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 1.6 percent decrease last year, and down 8.7 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 29.6 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, stated, "Business conditions remained challenging during May, with unseasonably cool and wet weather negatively impacting sales for the third consecutive month. From a regional perspective, the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic continued to be the most impacted. At both divisions, we were more promotional than last year, and we will continue to take the actions necessary to enable us to be clean from an inventory perspective as we enter the second half of the year."
 
Kay Krill, Ann Taylor President, added, "At the Ann Taylor division, much of our newer product continued to be well received by our client, but the impact of non-full price merchandise continues to weigh on results. As we go forward, we believe the combination of a better balance of full-price merchandise along with more wardrobable product will lead to improved performance. At LOFT, our May performance was similar to that of April, with the lack of transitional merchandise negatively impacting us. Despite this, we continue to believe that LOFT's results will gradually improve as we work through our inventory position and achieve a healthier level of full-price sales. We remain committed to our inventory management strategy, which, while impacting our gross margin in the second quarter, should enhance second half performance."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of May were up approximately 1 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 9 percent at Ann Taylor and up approximately 10 percent at Ann Taylor LOFT.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that total net sales for the four-week period ended July 30, 2005 increased 7.5 percent to $139,073,000 over total net sales of $129,412,000 for the four-week period ended July 31, 2004. By division, net sales were $58,272,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $63,938,000 last year, and $66,097,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $53,788,000 last year.
New York, New York, August 4, 2005
 
Comparable store sales for the period decreased 3.5 percent compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 2.1 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal July 2005 were down 10.3 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 3.1 percent decrease last year, and up 1.2 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 1.4 percent increase last year.
 
The Company also stated today that it currently estimates that second quarter earnings per share will be in a range of $0.08 - $0.10 including the previously announced charge of $9.5 million ($0.08 per share on a diluted basis) for lease costs relating to the relocation of its corporate offices. Excluding this charge (which will be a one-time only charge), expected earnings per share for the second quarter would be in the range of $0.16 - $0.18. The Company remains comfortable with its previous guidance, announced on May 19
th
, of earnings per diluted share of $1.17 for fiscal 2005.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman, J. Patrick Spainhour, stated, "During the month of July, we took the steps that were necessary to clear excess inventory and enable the Company to enter the third quarter in a healthier inventory position. Our summer endof-season sales were successful in moving clearance units as intended, and, as expected, the heavy level of promotional activity that occurred throughout the quarter has had a negative impact on our gross margin. We feel confident that our leaner inventory position coupled with improved merchandise at both Ann Taylor and LOFT lay the groundwork for better performance in the second half of the year, including improvements in gross margin."

July marked the second consecutive decrease in total inventory per square foot, and the Company continues to anticipate that consolidated inventory levels per square foot will be down in the low double-digit range by year end.
 
Ann Taylor President, Kay Krill, stated, "While July is historically a clearance month, we were pleased with the continued positive reads we received on product delivered in July at both Ann Taylor and LOFT, including a strong reception to our increased assortment of neutrals across all categories of the business. Additionally, sales activity strengthened in week four, which was driven by not only the wear-now' nature of our clearance merchandise but also positive client acceptance of transitional August product. These results bode well for our fall and holiday seasons, which will increasingly reflect the changes we are making in our merchandise assortments to best meet the wardrobing needs of our Ann Taylor and LOFT clients."
 
During the month, the Company did not open any new stores. The total store count at month end remained at 782, comprised of 361 Ann Taylor stores, 375 Ann Taylor LOFT stores, and 46 Ann Taylor Factory stores.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported net income for the second quarter ended July 30, 2005 of $7,139,000, or $0.10 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.5 million shares outstanding), compared to a net income of $30,087,000, or $0.41 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 74.7 million shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Excluding the previously announced charge of $9.5 million ($0.08 per share on a diluted basis) for lease costs relating to the relocation of its corporate offices (which will be a one-time only charge), earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 would be $0.18.
New York, New York, August 19, 2005
 
As previously reported, the Company's net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 totaled $508,684,000, up 7.6 percent from $472,634,000 for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $212,227,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $221,661,000 last year, and $245,389,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $208,541,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were down 3.9 percent, compared to an increase of 7.0 percent for the second quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the second quarter were down 6.1 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 0.8 percent increase last year, and down 3.2 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to an 18.1 percent increase last year.
 
Ann Taylor Chairman J. Patrick Spainhour said, "One of our key initiatives has been our inventory management strategy which should enhance gross margin in the second half of the year. We have entered the second half with the lowest average inventory level per store in the past five years."
 
Kay Krill, Ann Taylor President, stated, "Our first and foremost objective has been to restore financial performance to the Ann Taylor division. In the second quarter, our full-price penetration steadily increased as more of our new' product hit the floor, which indicates that we are well on our way to providing our client with a wardrobable assortment of updated classics that are stylish and flattering and meet her wardrobing needs for her lifestyle."

"At LOFT, we had a challenging season. We planned aggressive comparable store sales and the business did not materialize as we'd hoped for as we did not have the appropriate balance that our client expects from us. However, we entered the third quarter in a healthier position on several fronts: flat inventory to last year, a better balance of work versus casual options, a more focused color assortment, and a wear-now focus that is being well received. We remain as confident as ever about LOFT's future."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of the second quarter were down approximately 3 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 2 percent at Ann Taylor and flat at Ann Taylor LOFT.
 
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 47.5 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to 53.0 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to lower full-price sales at Ann Taylor LOFT and lower margins achieved on non full-price sales at both divisions, largely due to an increase in promotional activities at both divisions.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 were $231,064,000, or 45.4 percent of net sales, compared to $200,364,000, or 42.4 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily resulted from the one-time charge related to the relocation of the Company's corporate headquarters combined with an overall deleveraging of expenses due to the decrease in comparable store sales, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for management performance bonus.
 
Operating profit was 2.1 percent of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to 10.6 percent of net sales in the second quarter of last year.
 
During the second fiscal quarter of 2005, the Company opened 1 Ann Taylor store, 17 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 8 Ann Taylor Factory stores. The total store count at quarter-end was 782, comprised of 361 Ann Taylor stores, 375 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 46 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
 
Total store square footage increased 15.2 percent to 4,484,000 square feet as of July 30, 2005, from 3,893,000 square feet as of July 31, 2004. Total square footage by division at the end of the second quarter was 1,901,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 2,197,000 square feet for Ann Taylor LOFT.
 
For the full spring season (fiscal year-to-date period ending July 30, 2005), the Company's net income was $24,110,000, or $0.33 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.0 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $61,833,000 or $0.84 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 74.9 million shares outstanding), for the same period last year.

Spring 2005 net sales totaled $985,130,000, up 8.7 percent from $905,880,000 in spring 2004. By division, net sales for the spring season were $417,965,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $435,085,000 last year, and $468,793,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $393,928,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the spring 2005 season decreased 3.5 percent over the same period last year. Comparable store sales by division were down 5.5 percent for Ann Taylor and down 2.4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft.
 
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the spring 2005 season was 49.2 percent, compared to 55.5 percent in spring 2004. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to lower full-price sales at Ann Taylor LOFT and lower margins achieved on non full-price sales at both divisions, largely due to an increase in promotional activities at both divisions.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 45.4 percent for the spring 2005 season compared to 44.1 percent for the same period last year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the one-time charge related to the relocation of the Company's corporate headquarters combined with an overall deleveraging of expenses due to the decrease in comparable store sales, partially offset by a decrease in the provision for management performance bonus.
 
During the second fiscal quarter of 2005, the Company purchased 375,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $9,300,000.
 
On August 18, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new $100 million securities repurchase program which replaced the August 2004 program. Under the new program, purchases of shares of the Company's Common Stock will be made from time to time, subject to market conditions and at prevailing market prices, through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions.

Outlook
 
The Company expects to see gross margins improve from current levels in both the third and fourth quarters as inventory levels continue to decline and merchandise margins improve. Additionally, the Company expects to see a reduction from current levels in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in both the third and fourth quarters. The Company continues to anticipate that consolidated inventory levels per square foot will decline in the low double-digit range by the end of the fiscal year. Based on the above assumptions and previously announced planned store growth, the Company remains comfortable with its previous guidance of $1.17 per diluted share for fiscal 2005.
 
Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 782 stores in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also Online Stores at and as of July 30, 2005.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
 
. Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action,

Authorization of Indemnification
 
suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
 
. For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
Section 4.

Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Section 5.
Indemnification by a Court
 
. Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
Section 6.
Expenses Payable in Advance
 
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.
Section 7.
Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
 
. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.
Section 8.
Insurance
 
. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII.
Section 9.
Certain Definitions
 
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 10.
Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
 
. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(c) The Company may participate in the Proceeding at its own expense. The Company will not, without prior written consent of the Indemnitee, effect any settlement of a claim in any threatened or pending Proceeding unless such settlement solely involves the payment of money and includes an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability on any claims that are or were threatened to be made against the Indemnitee in the Proceeding.
 
11. .
PROCEDURE UPON APPLICATION FOR INDEMNIFICATION
 
(a) Upon written request by Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to the first sentence of Section 10(a), a determination, if required by applicable law, with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement thereto shall be made in the specific case:
 
(i) if a Change in Control has occurred, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; or
 
(ii) if a Change in Control has not occurred,
 
(A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board,
 
(B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum of the Board,
 
(C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or, if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee, or
 
(D) if so directed by the Board, by the stockholders of the Company.
 
If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within days after such determination.
 
Indemnitee shall cooperate with the person, persons or entity making such determination with respect to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such person, persons or entity upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information that is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination. Any Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification) and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.
 
(b) If the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by Independent Counsel, the Independent Counsel shall be selected as follows.
 
(i) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him/her of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected.
 
(ii) if a Change in Control shall have occurred, the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee (unless he/she shall request that such selection be made by the Board, in which event the preceding sentence shall apply), and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected.
 
In either event, Indemnitee or the Company, as the case may be, may, within 10 days after such written notice of selection shall have been given, deliver to the Company or to Indemnitee, as the case may be, a written objection to such selection; provided, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not meet the requirements of "Independent Counsel" as defined in Section 2 of this/her Agreement, and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit. If, within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other's selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 11(a) hereof. Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 13(a) of this/her Agreement, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).
 
12. .
PRESUMPTIONS AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS
 
(a) In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the person or persons or entity making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this/her Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 10(a) of this/her Agreement, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any person, persons or entity of any determination contrary to that presumption.
 
(b) Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this/her Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or independent legal counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
 
(c) If the person, persons or entity empowered or selected to determine whether Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification shall not have made a determination within 60 days after receipt by the Company of the request therefor, the requisite determination of entitlement to indemnification shall be deemed to have been made and Indemnitee shall be entitled to such indemnification, absent a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law; provided, that
 
(i) such 60-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person, persons or entity making the determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluating of documentation and/or information relating thereto; and
 
(ii) the provisions of this/her Section 12(c) shall not apply (1) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is to be made by the stockholders pursuant to Section 11(a) of this/her Agreement and if (A) within 15 days after receipt by the Company of the request for such determination the Board has resolved to submit such determination to the stockholders for their consideration at an annual meeting thereof to be held within 75 days after such receipt and such determination is made thereat, or (B) a special meeting of stockholders is called within 15 days after such receipt for the purpose of making such determination, such meeting is held for such purpose within 60 days after having been so called and such determination is made thereat, or (2) if the determination of entitlement to indemnification is made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 11(a) of this/her Agreement.
 
(d) The termination of a Proceeding or of any claim, issue or matter therein, by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself adversely affect the right of Indemnitee to indemnification or create a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner which he/she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company or, with respect to any criminal Proceeding, that Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe that his/her conduct was unlawful.
 
(e) Indemnitee shall be deemed to have acted in good faith if Indemnitee's action is based on the records or books of account of the Enterprise,
 
including financial statements, or on information supplied to Indemnitee by the officers of the Enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with the reasonable care by the Enterprise. The provisions of this/her Section 12(e) shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the other circumstances in which the Indemnitee may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this/her Agreement.
 
(f) The knowledge and/or actions, or failure to act, of any director, officer, agent or employee of any Enterprise shall not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnification under this/her Agreement.

(b) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this/her Agreement that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification, any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this/her Section 13 shall be conducted in all respects as a de novo trial, or arbitration, on the merits and Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of that adverse determination. In any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this/her Section 13, the Company shall have the burden of proving Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification or advancement of Expenses, as the case may be.
 
(c) If a determination shall have been made pursuant to Section 11(a) of this/her Agreement that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, the Company shall be bound by such determination in any judicial proceeding or arbitration commenced pursuant to this/her Section 13, absent a prohibition of such indemnification under applicable law.

The Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against any and all Expenses and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall (within 10 days after receipt by the Company of a written request therefor) advance, to the extent not prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other applicable law, such expenses to Indemnitee, which are incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Action brought by Indemnitee for indemnification or advancement of Expenses from the Company under this/her Agreement or under any directors' and officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, advancement of Expenses or insurance recovery.

(a) The rights provided by this/her Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Indemnitee may at any time be entitled under applicable law, the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, the Company's Bylaws, any agreement, a vote of stockholders or a resolution of directors, or otherwise. No amendment, alteration or repeal of this/her Agreement or of any provision hereof shall limit or restrict any right of Indemnitee under this/her Agreement in respect of any action taken or omitted by such Indemnitee prior to such amendment, alteration or repeal. To the extent that a change in Delaware law, whether by statute or judicial decision, permits greater indemnification or advancement of Expenses than would be afforded currently under the Company's Bylaws and this/her Agreement, it is the intent of the parties hereto that Indemnitee shall enjoy by this/her Agreement the greater benefits so afforded by such change. No right or remedy herein conferred is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every other right and remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.

The Company agrees to promptly notify
 
Indemnitee of any material change in any such policy. The Company may, but will not be required to, create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means, including, without limitation, a letter of credit, to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to satisfy the obligations to indemnify and advance Expenses pursuant to this/her Agreement. If, at the time of the receipt of a notice of a claim pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company has director and officer liability insurance in effect, the Company shall give prompt notice of the commencement of such proceeding to the insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the respective policies. The Company and Indemnitee shall mutually cooperate and take all reasonable actions to cause such insurers to pay on behalf of the insureds, all amounts payable as a result of such proceeding in accordance with the terms of all applicable policies.
 
(c) The Company shall be subrogated to the extent of any payment under this/her Agreement to all of the rights of recovery of Indemnitee, who shall execute all papers required and take all action necessary to secure such rights, including execution of such documents as are necessary to enable the Company to bring suit to enforce such rights.

(e) The Company's obligation to indemnify or advance Expenses hereunder to Indemnitee who is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee or agent of any Enterprise shall be reduced by any amount Indemnitee has actually received as indemnification or advancement of expenses from such other Enterprise.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that total net sales for the five-week period ended October 1, 2005 increased 8.7 percent to $203,998,000 over total net sales of $187,667,000 for the five-week period ended October 2, 2004. By division, net sales were $84,027,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $79,722,000 last year, and $99,125,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $89,969,000 last year.
New York, New York, October 6, 2005
 
Comparable store sales for the period decreased 2.7 percent compared to a comparable store sales increase of 1.4 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal September 2005 were up 4.0 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 5.1 percent decrease last year, and down 8.5 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 10.2 percent increase last year.
 
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "While many of the underlying financial metrics were strong during September, overall results for the month were negatively affected by a low double-digit decrease in traffic at both divisions and a change in the promotional cadence at LOFT. Additionally, sales of seasonal product, such as outerwear, heavy wool and boots, were negatively impacted by the unseasonably warm weather, with the Northeast region experiencing the greatest impact."
 
Ms. Krill continued, "At Ann Taylor, our clients continued to respond positively to our new product, and both dollars per transaction and conversion increased over last year. At LOFT, we also saw a favorable client response to our September product. However, during the month, we modified certain promotional activities which had the impact of reducing sales, particularly in the first half of the month, but improved our margin rate. Both dollars per transaction and conversion were comparable to last year, despite the low double-digit decline in traffic. Based on our sales and margins to date, we are reaffirming our guidance of earnings per diluted share of $1.17 for fiscal 2005."

 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported net income for the third quarter ended October 29, 2005 of $30,346,000, or $0.42 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.3 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $13,912,000, or $0.19 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 71.6 million shares outstanding) in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.
New York, New York, November 18, 2005
 
The Company's net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 totaled $513,976,000, up 11.6 percent from $460,365,000 for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $210,027,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $199,615,000 last year, and $251,867,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $215,447,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were up 0.2 percent, compared to an increase of 1.4 percent for the third quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the third quarter were up 3.7 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 4.2 percent decrease last year, and down 2.5 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 9.2 percent increase last year.
 
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "As a result of improved merchandise, particularly at the Ann Taylor division, as well as better inventory management, our gross margin improved 320 basis points over last year. This improvement, combined with the leveraging of our selling, general and administrative expenses, resulted in our significant increase in operating profit and earnings per share versus last year, and we remain comfortable with our previous guidance of earnings per diluted share of $1.17 for fiscal 2005."

Ms. Krill continued, "At Ann Taylor, our client continued to respond positively to our newer product as well as our wardrobing focus. The division achieved positive comparable store sales in each month of the quarter, demonstrating that we are moving in the right direction toward restoring financial performance at the Ann Taylor division. The LOFT division achieved positive results in August and October while September was more challenging, due to a change in our promotional cadence and sluggish sales of cold weather product."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of the third quarter were down approximately 17 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 16 percent at Ann Taylor and flat at Ann Taylor LOFT.
 
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 54.2 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to 51.0 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher full-price sales and less promotional sales activity at Ann Taylor, partially offset by lower full-price sales and lower margin rates achieved on non full-price sales at Ann Taylor Loft.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 were $228,653,000, or 44.5 percent of net sales, compared to $212,034,000, or 46.1 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower marketing costs, which were higher last year due to the Company's 50
th
anniversary advertising campaign.
 
Operating profit was 9.7 percent of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 compared to 4.9 percent of net sales in the third quarter of last year.
 
During the third fiscal quarter of 2005, the Company opened 5 Ann Taylor stores, 32 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 3 Ann Taylor Factory stores. The total store count at quarter-end was 820, comprised of 364 Ann Taylor stores, 407 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 49 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
 
Total store square footage increased 14.9 percent to 4,739,000 square feet as of October 29, 2005, from 4,125,000 square feet as of October 30, 2004. Total square footage by division at the end of the third quarter was 1,929,000 square feet for Ann Taylor and 2,400,000 square feet for Ann Taylor LOFT.
 
For the fiscal year-to-date period ending October 29, 2005, the Company's net income was $54,456,000, or $0.76 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.1 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $75,745,000, or $1.04 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 73.7 million shares outstanding), for the same period last year.

Fiscal year-to-date net sales totaled $1,499,106,000, up 9.7 percent in 2005 from $1,366,245,000. By division, net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were $627,992,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $634,700,000 last year, and $720,660,000 for Ann Taylor Loft compared to $609,375,000 last year. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period decreased 2.3 percent from the same period last year. Comparable store sales by division were down 2.6 percent for Ann Taylor and down 2.4 percent for Ann Taylor Loft.
 
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period ending October 29, 2005 was 50.9 percent, compared to 54.0 percent for the same period last year. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to lower full-price sales at Ann Taylor Loft in the third quarter and lower margins achieved on both full-price and non full-price sales at both divisions, primarily during the first six months of Fiscal 2005.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 45.1 percent for the fiscal 2005 year-to-date period compared to 44.8 percent for the same period last year.
 
During the third fiscal quarter of 2005, the Company purchased 700,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $17,626,000.

A copy of the Agreement is filed herewith as Exhibit 10, and a summary description of the material terms of the Agreement is set forth below which summary is qualified in its entirety by the attached Agreement. Under the Agreement, Ms. Krill will serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and for as long as Ms. Krill is employed as the Chief Executive Officer, the Company shall nominate her for re-election as a member of the Board. The Agreement is effective as of October 1, 2005 and has an initial three-year term, provided, that, commencing October 1, 2008, the term shall be automatically renewed for successive one-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least six months prior to the applicable October 1. Under the Agreement, Ms. Krill will receive an annual base salary of at least $1,000,000. For each fiscal year, Ms. Krill shall be eligible to earn an annual cash bonus under the Company's Management Performance Compensation Plan (the "Bonus Plan"). Commencing with the Company's 2006 fiscal year, Ms. Krill's Performance Percentage (as defined in the Bonus Plan) shall be 100% per annum and the business criterion to be used in determining the relevant performance goals shall be determined by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board.

Concurrent with the Board's approval of the Agreement, the Company granted Ms. Krill an option to purchase 200,000 shares of Company common stock under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the "Plan"). The option was granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value on the date of grant ($28.49) and generally shall vest with respect to one-third of such shares on each of October 1, 2006, 2007 and 2008, subject to Ms. Krill's continued employment. Subject to shareholder approval of an amendment to the Plan to increase the number of shares of Company common stock available for issuance under the Plan, the Company granted Ms. Krill 400,000 shares of restricted common stock on November 17, 2005; 200,000 of such restricted shares generally shall vest over time with one-third vesting on each of October 1, 2006, October 1, 2007 and October 1, 2008; and the remaining 200,000 restricted shares generally shall be eligible to vest pro rata on the March 15 following the end of each of the Company's 2006, 2007 and 2008 fiscal years based upon the attainment of certain performance goals as determined by the Compensation Committee and approved by the Board (in each case, subject to Ms. Krill's continued employment with the Company).

If (i) the Company shall terminate the Executive's employment other than for Disability pursuant to Section 6(a)(iii) or for Cause, (ii) the Executive shall terminate her employment for Good Reason, or (iii) the Term of this Agreement expires as a result of a Non-Renewal Notice having been provided by the Company, then, subject to the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof: (1) the Company shall pay the Accrued Obligations to the Executive at the time(s) set forth in Section 6A(a)(i) hereof and shall continue to provide health, medical and life insurance benefits to the Executive with the full cost to be paid by the Company for the greater of the term of the Agreement or eighteen (18) months (but in no event later than the end of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Date of Termination occurs); and, if permissible, COBRA benefits will commence after the applicable period has expired); provided, however that the Company's obligation to provide such continued health and medical benefits shall be reduced to the extent that equivalent coverages and benefits (determined on a coverage-by-coverage and benefit-by-benefit basis) of the same type are received by or made available by a subsequent employer to the Executive during such time (and the Executive within a reasonable period of time will notify the Company with respect to any such benefits received by or made available to the Executive); (2) (A) unless clause (B) below applies, then following the Date of Termination and for the longer of eighteen (18) months thereafter or the remaining Term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to the Executive monthly an amount equal to the Severance Payments (as defined in Section 6A(a)(ii) hereof) and all equity awards shall be treated as set forth in Sections 6A(a)(iii)-(v) hereof, or (B) in the event the Date of Termination occurs following a Change in Control, then, (i) within five days after the Date of Termination, the Company shall pay to the Executive in a lump sum an amount equal to the product of (X) three (3), multiplied by (Y) the sum of the Executive's annual salary at the rate in effect as of the Date of Termination plus the Severance Bonus (as defined below). Severance Bonus shall mean: (I) if the Date of Termination occurs on or after the end of the Company's 2006 fiscal year, the average of the total bonuses earned by the Executive, including bonuses earned under the Performance Plan, the Long-Term Plans and all successor plans, in the three (or fewer) fiscal years of the Company ended immediately prior to the Date of Termination (excluding fiscal years prior to the Company's 2006 fiscal year); or (II) if the Date of Termination occurs on or prior to the end of the Company's 2006 fiscal year, the greater of (i) the total bonuses earned by the Executive for the fiscal year ended coincident with or immediately prior to the Date of Termination, or (ii) 100% of the target bonus for the year in which the Date of Termination occurs; For purposes of this subsection (2)(B): (I) if the Date of Termination occurs prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control but during the pendency of a Potential Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), such Date of Termination shall be deemed to have occurred following a Change in Control, and (II) a "Potential Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred if the event set forth in any one of the following clauses shall have occurred: (i) the Company enters into an agreement, the consummation of which would result in the occurrence of a Change in Control; (ii) the Company or any person (as defined in Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as modified and used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof (a "Person"), except that such term shall not include (w) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (x) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its affiliates, (y) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (z) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company) publicly announces an intention to take or to consider taking actions which, if consummated, would constitute a Change in Control; (iii) any Person becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 15% or more of either the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (not including the securities beneficially owned by such Person or any securities acquired directly from the Company); or (iv) the Board of Directors adopts a resolution to the effect that, for purposes of this subsection (2), a Potential Change in Control has occurred. The pendency of a Potential Change in Control shall immediately cease upon the adoption of a resolution of the Company's Board of Directors to that effect. (3) For purposes of this Agreement, the period during or with respect to which the Executive is entitled to receive payments hereunder is referred to as the "Severance Period"; (4) all outstanding stock options granted to the Executive (including the Option granted pursuant to Section 5(b) hereof) and all outstanding restricted shares granted to the Executive (including the Time-Vested Restricted Shares and the Performance-Based Restricted Shares granted pursuant to Sections 5(c) and 5(d), respectively) shall be governed by the respective plans and award agreements under which each such award was granted; and (5) the Executive shall be provided with outplacement services commensurate with her position. (e) Gross-Up Payment. In the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by the Executive in connection with a Change in Control or the termination of the Executive's employment, whether such payments or benefits are received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement with the Company, any person whose actions result in a Change in Control or any person affiliated with the Company or such person (all such payments and benefits being hereinafter called "Total Payments"), would be subject (in whole or part), to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the Company shall pay to the Executive such additional amounts (the "Gross-Up Payment") as may be necessary to place the Executive in the same after-tax position as if no portion of the Total Payments had been subject to the Excise Tax. In the event that the Excise Tax is subsequently determined to be less than the amount taken into account hereunder, the Executive shall repay to the Company, at the time that the amount of such reduction in Excise Tax is finally determined, the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction (plus that portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to the Excise Tax and federal, state and local income tax imposed on the Gross-Up Payment being repaid by the Executive to the extent that such repayment results in a reduction in Excise Tax and/or a federal, state or local income tax deduction) plus interest on the amount of such repayment at the rate provided in Section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the Code. In the event that the Excise Tax is determined to exceed the amount taken into account hereunder (including by reason of any payment the existence or amount of which cannot be determined at the time of the Gross-Up Payment), the Company shall make an additional Gross-Up Payment in respect of such excess (plus any interest, penalties or additions payable by the Executive with respect to such excess) at the time that the amount of such excess is finally determined. The Executive and the Company shall each reasonably cooperate with the other in connection with any administrative or judicial proceedings concerning the existence or amount of liability for Excise Tax with respect to the Total Payments. (f) Compliance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Executive is deemed to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 409A"), no payment that is "deferred compensation" subject to Section 409A shall be made to the Executive prior to the date that is six (6) months after the date of separation from service (as defined in Section 409A)(or, if earlier, the Executive's date of death). In such event, the payments subject to the six (6) month delay will be paid in a lump sum on the earliest permissible payment date. 7. Nonsolicitation; Noncompete. Subject to (c) below, during the period of the Executive's employment, during the period she is receiving Severance Payments hereunder and, in the case where the Executive's employment is terminated for Cause or the Executive voluntarily terminates her employment without Good Reason, for a period of twelve months following such termination, the Executive shall not initiate discussions with any person who is then an executive employee of the Company (i.e., director level or above) with the intent of soliciting or inducing such person to leave his or her employment with a view toward joining the Executive in the pursuit of any business activity (whether or not such activity involves engaging or participating in a Competitive Business, as defined below). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Executive fails to comply with the preceding sentence, all rights of the Executive and her surviving spouse or other beneficiary hereunder to any future Severance Payments and continuing life insurance and medical coverage and all rights with respect to restricted stock and exercisability of stock options shall be forfeited; provided that, the foregoing shall not apply if such failure of compliance commences following a Change in Control. (a) Subject to (c) below, as long as the Executive receives Severance Payments, or in the case where the Executive's employment is terminated for Cause or the Executive voluntarily terminates her employment without Good Reason, for a period of twelve months following such termination, the Executive shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), engage or participate in any business which is "in competition" (as defined below) with the business of the Company or any of its 50% or more owned affiliates (such business being referred to herein as a "Competitive Business"). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Executive fails to comply with the preceding sentence, all rights of the Executive and her surviving spouse or other beneficiary hereunder to any future Severance Payments, and continuing life insurance and medical coverage and all rights with respect to restricted stock and exercisability of stock options shall be forfeited; provided that, the foregoing shall not apply if such failure of compliance commences following a Change in Control. (b) In the event of a violation of Sections 7(a) or 7(b) hereof, the remedies of the Company shall be limited to (i) if such violation occurs during the period of Executive's employment hereunder, termination of the Executive for Cause and the associated rights of the Company specified herein resulting therefrom, (ii) regardless of when such violation occurs, forfeiture by the Executive of the payments, benefits and other rights set forth in sections (a) and (b) above if and to the extent provided in such sections, and (iii) the right to seek injunctive relief in accordance with and to the extent provided in Section 14 hereof; provided such injunctive relief may only be sought for competitive activity under Section (b) above if such activity occurs during employment or after Executive's dismissal for Cause or Executive voluntarily terminates her employment for Good Reason. (c) For purposes hereof, a business will be "in competition" with the business of the Company or its 50% or more owned affiliates only if (i) the Company's business with which the other business competes accounted for 20% or more of the Company's consolidated revenues as of the end of its most recently completed fiscal year prior to the Date of Termination, and (ii) the entity (including all 50% or more owned affiliates) through which the other business is or will be operated maintains a "women's apparel" business which generated at least $100 million in revenue during the entity's most recently completed fiscal year ended prior to the date the Executive commences (or proposes to commence) to engage or participate in the other business. For purposes hereof, "women's apparel" shall consist of dresses, jackets, pants, shorts, skirts, blouses, sweaters, T-shirts, outerwear, footwear and accessories. (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive's engaging in the following activities shall not be construed as engaging or participating in a Competitive Business: (i) investment banking; (ii) passive ownership of less than 2% of any class of securities of a public company; (iii) engaging or participating in noncompetitive businesses of an entity which also operates a business which is "in competition" with the business of the Company or its affiliates; (iv) serving as an outside director of an entity which operates a business which is "in competition" with the business of the Company or its affiliates, so long as such business did not account for 10% or more of the consolidated revenues of such entity as of the end of its most recently completed fiscal year prior to the date the Executive commences (or proposes to commence) serving as an outside director; (v) engaging in a business involving licensing arrangements so long as such business is not an in-house arrangement for any entity "in competition" with the business of the Company or its affiliates; (vi) affiliation with an advertising agency, and (vii) after cessation of employment, engaging or participating in the "wholesale" side of the women's apparel business, which for purposes hereof shall mean the design, manufacture and sale of piece goods and women's apparel to unrelated third parties, provided that if the entity for which the Executive so engages or participates (including its affiliates) also conducts a retail women's apparel business, then effective upon the Executive's engaging or participating in such business, all continuing life insurance and medical coverage provided by the Company shall cease and all Severance Payments shall cease except for amounts representing the excess (if any) of the Executive's annual base salary hereunder (at the rate in effect as of the Date of Termination) over the Executive's base salary received from such entity and its affiliates, which amounts shall continue to be paid by the Company for the remainder of the period in which the Executive is entitled to receive Severance Payments hereunder. The exceptions contained in subsection (vii) above and subsection (iii) above to the extent covered by subsection (vii) shall not be applicable if the Executive's cessation of employment is voluntary by the Executive without Good Reason and her new engagement or participation involves "wholesale" operations which include or also conduct retail sales of women's apparel other than factory outlet or discount stores to liquidate unsold women's apparel of such wholesale operations. 8. Protection of Confidential Information. (a) The Executive acknowledges that her employment by the Company will, throughout the Term of this Agreement, involve her obtaining knowledge of confidential information regarding the business and affairs of the Company. In recognition of the foregoing, the Executive covenants and agrees that: (i) except in compliance with legal process, she will keep secret all confidential matters of the Company which are not otherwise in the public domain and will not intentionally disclose them to anyone outside of the Company, wherever located (other than to a person to whom disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance by Executive of her duties as an executive officer of the Company), either during or after the Term, except with the prior written consent of the Board of Directors or a person authorized thereby; and (ii) she will deliver promptly to the Company on termination of her employment or at any other time the Company may so request, all memoranda, notes, records, customer lists, reports and other documents (and all copies thereof) relating to the business of the Company which she obtained while employed by, or otherwise serving or acting on behalf of, the Company and which she may then possess or have under her control. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14 of this Agreement, if the Executive commits a breach of the provisions of Section 8(a)(i) or 8(a) (ii), the Company shall have the right and remedy to have such provisions specifically enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to the Company and that money damages will not provide an adequate remedy to the Company. 9. Successors; Binding Agreement. (a) Neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder shall be assignable or otherwise subject to hypothecation by the Executive (except by will or by operation of the laws of intestate succession) or by the Company, except that the Company will require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company, by agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Executive, to expressly assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such assumption and agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall entitle the Executive to compensation from the Company in the same amount and on the same terms as she would be entitled to hereunder if she terminated her employment for Good Reason except that for purposes of implementing the foregoing, the date on which any such succession becomes effective shall be deemed the Date of Termination. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as herein before defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which executes and delivers the agreement provided for in this Section 9 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law. (b) This Agreement and all rights of the Executive hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, devisees and legatees. If the Executive should die while any amounts would still be payable to her hereunder if she had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to the Executive's devisee, legatee, or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to the Executive's estate. 10. Notice. For the purposes of this Agreement, notices, demands and all other communications provided for in this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when (i) personally delivered to the Executive or an executive officer of the Company, (ii) five (5) business days after being mailed by United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (iii) one business day after being shipped by an overnight courier service, to the address as follows: If to the Company: AnnTaylor Stores Corporation 7 Times Square New York, New York 10036 Attn: General Counsel If to the Executive: Katherine Lawther Krill 333 Stamford Avenue Stamford, Connecticut 06902 With a copy to: Howard Pianko, Esq.

Miscellaneous. No provisions of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in a writing signed by the Executive and such officer of the Company as may be specifically designated by the Board of Directors. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.

All payments hereunder shall be subject to applicable Federal, State and local tax withholding requirements. 12. Validity. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument. 14.

Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court having jurisdiction; provided that, the Company shall be entitled to seek a restraining order or injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any continuation of any violation of the provisions of Section 7 or 8 of the Agreement and the Executive hereby consents that such restraining order or injunction may be granted without the necessity of the Company's posting any bond and further provided that, the Executive shall be entitled to seek specific performance of her right to be paid until the Date of Termination during the pendency of any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees) in connection with any arbitration proceeding instituted hereunder; provided that the Company shall pay directly or reimburse the Executive for any legal fees incurred by Executive in any arbitration in which she prevails. 15.

In the event that any provision of this Agreement would or may cause this Agreement to fail to comply with Section 409A, such provision may be deemed null and void and the Company and the Executive agree to amend or restructure this Agreement, to the extent necessary and appropriate to avoid adverse tax consequences under Section 409A. 17. Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and supersedes any other prior agreements, promises, covenants, arrangements, communications, representations or warranties, whether oral or written, by any officer, employee or representative of any party hereto, including without limitation, and the Prior Agreement which is replaced hereby as of the Effective Date, except that any equity awards granted prior to the Effective Date shall continue to be governed by the Prior Agreement and the respective plans and award agreements under which such awards were granted.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that total net sales for the four-week period ended November 26, 2005 increased 24.8 percent to $182,489,000 over total net sales of $146,186,000 for the four-week period ended November 27, 2004. By division, net sales were $76,246,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $62,992,000 last year, and $86,134,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $65,954,000 last year.
New York, New York, December 1, 2005
 
Comparable store sales for the period increased 12.9 percent compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 8.3 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal November 2005 were up 18.6 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 16.3 percent decrease last year, and up 10.2 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 0.8 percent increase last year.
 
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "We were pleased with the overall performance of our business in November, with both Ann Taylor and Ann Taylor LOFT delivering strong results in all regions. Our special occasion product offerings have been very well-received, contributing to the double-digit comparable store sales increases experienced at both divisions. The neutral color focus of champagne, ivory and black in both divisions was also exceptionally strong. While we continue to carefully monitor the retail environment which remains highly competitive and promotional, based on our November results, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance of earnings per diluted share of $1.17 for fiscal 2005."
 
Total inventory levels at the end of November were down approximately 21 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 20 percent for Ann Taylor and down approximately 15 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT. The Company continues to anticipate that consolidated inventory levels per square foot will be down in the double-digit range by year-end.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that total net sales for the five-week period ended December 31, 2005 increased 11.6 percent to $267,695,000 over total net sales of $239,924,000 for the five-week period ended January 1, 2005. By division, net sales were $114,463,000 for Ann Taylor compared to $110,165,000 last year, and $128,811,000 for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $107,436,000 last year.
New York, New York, January 5, 2006
 
Comparable store sales for the period increased 1.5 percent compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 1.5 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal December 2005 were up 2.3 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 7.4 percent decrease last year, and up 1.6 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 6.3 percent increase last year.
 
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "During December, both divisions experienced positive comparable store sales in all regions despite mid to high single-digit declines in traffic. At Ann Taylor, given the strong momentum we experienced in November, sales were somewhat lower than expected. However, two categories that were particularly well received were sweaters and special occasion. LOFT performed in line with our expectations for the month, highlighted by strength in sweaters, separates, dresses and special occasion offerings. Based on our December and year-to-date results, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance of earnings per diluted share of $1.17, though we continue to carefully monitor the highly promotional retail environment."
 
The Company continued to carefully manage inventory, with total inventory levels at the end of December down approximately 19 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. Inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 15 percent for both divisions.

ITEM 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
.
 
AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (the "Company") announced today that it has reached a tentative agreement to settle two previously disclosed putative class action lawsuits related to how the Company classified certain employees under California overtime laws. The lawsuits are similar to numerous lawsuits filed against retailers and others with operations in California.
 
On February 15, 2005, two former managers of the Company's California stores filed a putative class action against AnnTaylor Retail, Inc. in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleging that the Company misclassified its store managers and senior assistant and assistant store managers as exempt from California overtime wage and hour laws, thereby depriving them of overtime pay and adequate meal breaks. On May 5, 2005, a second putative class action was filed against AnnTaylor Stores Corporation in San Francisco County Superior Court by a former senior assistant manager of one of the Company's stores in California alleging violations of California labor laws with respect to overtime pay as well as adequate meal and rest periods. On December 12, 2005, another former senior assistant manager of one of the Company's California stores filed a third putative class action in Los Angeles Superior Court against both of these AnnTaylor entities and AnnTaylor, Inc. alleging that the Company misclassified senior assistant and assistant managers as exempt from California overtime laws, thereby denying them overtime pay and required meal and rest periods.
 
While the Company denies the allegations underlying these lawsuits, it has agreed to the tentative settlement in connection with the first two lawsuits, to avoid significant legal fees, other expenses and management time that would have to be devoted to protracted litigation.
 
The settlement agreement, which is subject to final documentation and court approval, provides for a settlement payment of approximately $6.5 million.
 
Since the first two lawsuits cover the same employees and the same claims as those covered in the third lawsuit, if the settlement is approved, it is expected to dispose of the class claims in all three lawsuits, including penalties, interest and attorney's fees. The proposed settlement class covers store managers, senior assistant managers and assistant managers of the Company employed in California during the period from February 15, 2001 to the date of final approval of the settlement.
 
A copy of the Press Release announcing this settlement is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
ITEM 2.02. Results of Operations and Financial Condition
.
 
On February 28, 2006, the Company issued a Press Release announcing the settlement of the litigation described in Item 1.01 above and a related one time pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005 of approximately $6.5 million (or approximately $0.06 per diluted share). The Company stated that the previously
 
 
 
provided earnings guidance of $1.17 per fully diluted share (on a GAAP basis) for fiscal year 2005 excludes the impact of the litigation settlement announced today.
 
A copy of the Press Release announcing this settlement is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
The information included herein and in Exhibit 99.1 is being furnished under Item 2.02 and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), nor shall such information be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, regardless of the general incorporation language of such filing, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.

Excluding those items, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 would have been $31.3 million, or $0.43 per share on a diluted basis, compared to a net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 of $5.1 million, or $0.07 per share on a diluted basis. The mean estimate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, as reported by First Call, was $0.40 per share on a diluted basis.
As previously announced, total net sales for the fourth quarter were $574.0 million, up 17.8 percent from $487.4 million last year. By division, net sales were $245.9 million for Ann Taylor compared to $220.2 million last year, and $271.3 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $217.2 million last year. Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter increased 6.8 percent compared to a 4.0 percent decrease last year.

By division, comparable store sales increased 9.8 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a decrease of 10.1 percent last year, and increased 5.5 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 3.2 percent increase last year.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 51.0 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to 43.0 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher full-price sales and less promotional sales activity at Ann Taylor.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 were $249.5 million, or 43.5 percent of net sales, compared to $230.9 million, or 47.4 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased leverage on fixed expenses due to higher comparable store sales, decreases in marketing, home office tenancy, severance and pension costs, partially offset by a one-time charge related to the legal settlement described below.
The Company posted operating income of $43.2 million, or 7.5 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, compared to an operating loss of $21.5 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of last year.
During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005, the Company opened nine Ann Taylor LOFT stores and two Ann Taylor Factory stores. The total store count at quarter-end was 824, comprised of 357 Ann Taylor stores, 416 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 51 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
During the fourth quarter, the Company purchased 325,000 shares of its common stock at an approximate cost of $10.7 million. Of the $100 million securities repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors in August 2005, approximately $71.7 million remains.
Fiscal Year Results
For the fiscal year ended January 28, 2006, the Company reported net income of $81.9 million, or $1.13 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.3 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $63.3 million, or $0.88 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.9 million shares outstanding), for the same period last year.
The Company's results for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 include a number of items outlined below that impact their comparability. A discussion of these items follows under the heading "Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information." Excluding those items, net income for fiscal 2005 would have been $91.3 million, or $1.26 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $70.6 million, or $0.98 per share on a diluted basis last year. The mean estimate for fiscal 2005, as reported by First Call, was $1.23 per share on a diluted basis.

As previously reported, fiscal year net sales totaled $2.1 billion, up 11.8 percent from $1.9 billion last year. By division, net sales were $873.9 million for Ann Taylor compared to $854.9 million last year and $991.9 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $826.6 million last year. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year increased 0.1 percent compared to a 3.6 percent increase last year. By division, comparable store sales increased 0.6 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 2.7 percent decrease last year and decreased 0.3 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 12.8 percent increase last year.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the fiscal year was 50.9 percent, down slightly from 51.1 percent for the same period last year.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during 2005 were $925.0 million, or 44.6 percent of net sales, compared to $842.6 million, or 45.5 percent of net sales for the same period last year. The leveraging of selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower marketing and severance costs and a decrease in the provision for management bonus, partially offset by the costs associated with the relocation of its corporate headquarters and a one-time charge related to the legal settlement described below.
The Company posted operating income of $131.0 million, or 6.3 percent of net sales, compared to $105.0 million, or 5.6 percent of net sales in fiscal 2004.
Total inventory levels at the end of the fiscal year were down approximately 22 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 18 percent at Ann Taylor and down approximately 23 percent at Ann Taylor LOFT.
Total store square footage increased 14.2 percent to 4.8 million square feet as of January 28, 2006, from 4.2 million square feet as of January 29, 2005. Total square footage by division at the end of fiscal 2005 was 1.9 million square feet for Ann Taylor and 2.5 million square feet for Ann Taylor LOFT.

Certain Non-GAAP Financial Information
The Company's results for fourth quarter 2005, fourth quarter 2004, fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2004 include the items outlined below, which impact comparability. See section titled "GAAP Reconciliation" for presentation of the effect of these adjustments on operating income, net income and earnings per share.
 
 
 
Fiscal Year 2006 Outlook
The Company expects to see fiscal year 2006 comparable store sales increase in the low single-digit range over 2005, with gross margin improving over last year. Additionally, the Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to grow by approximately 11 to 12 percent over 2005 levels.
The Company plans to open approximately 10 Ann Taylor stores, 60 LOFT stores and five Ann Taylor Factory Stores, with total square footage growth of approximately 7.3 percent.
Consolidated inventory levels on a per-square-foot basis are expected to be down in the high-teen range over last year at the end of the second quarter and down in the low single-digit range over last year at the end of the fiscal year.
The Company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 will be in the range of $155 to $160 million, including new store construction, store renovation and re-branding, information systems, corporate office and distribution center initiatives.
Based on the above assumptions, the Company is currently comfortable with a range of $1.60  $1.65 for earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2006. This includes an estimated $0.06 charge to reflect the expensing of stock options. Excluding the impact of stock option expense, earnings per diluted share on an operating basis for fiscal 2006 would be in the range of $1.66 to $1.71. This represents a 32 to 36 percent increase over 2005's $1.26 in diluted earnings per share on an operating basis.

GAAP Reconciliation
In addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), the Company provides certain non-GAAP financial information relating to net income and net income per diluted share, each as adjusted for certain charges as discussed above, that the Company believes impact the comparability of its results of operations. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial information to GAAP are set forth in the table below.
The Company believes that such non-GAAP financial information is useful to investors to assist in assessing and understanding the Company's operating performance and underlying trends in the Company's business. This non-GAAP financial information is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating the Company's financial and operating performance.
The presentation of this additional non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or alternative to, net income and net income per diluted share determined in accordance with GAAP. Analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, data presented in accordance with GAAP.

Adoption of Performance Measures for Fiscal 2006
On March 8, 2006, the Compensation Committee established performance goals and target award percentages for each participant eligible to earn cash bonuses under the Company's Management Performance Compensation Plan ("Performance Compensation Plan") and its 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan.
The bonuses payable to the named executive officers under the Performance Compensation Plan with respect to fiscal year 2006 are based on the achievement of certain company-wide net income goals approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee also designated annual performance targets based on a combination of return on net assets and earnings per share that must be achieved for the 2006-2008 three-year cycle for incentive compensation to be paid under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan for that cycle.
Under the Performance Compensation Plan, a named executive officer's incentive target is a percentage of his/her base salary ranging from 50% to 100% depending on corporate title and responsibilities. Under the 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan, a named executive officer's incentive target is a percentage of his/her base salary ranging from 30% to 50% depending on corporate title and responsibilities. In each case, the actual bonus payments under such awards may be less than or greater than the target amounts or not earned depending on whether and the extent to which the financial performance of the Company meets, exceeds or is below the target.
Base Salaries
As part of its regular annual salary review, on March 8, 2006 the Compensation Committee approved the 2006 annual base salary of each of the named executive officers as follows: Kay Krill ($1,000,000), Laura Weil ($700,000), Barbara Eisenberg ($375,000), Anthony Romano ($541,000) and James Smith ($381,000).
Performance Measures established for Restricted Stock
The Compensation Committee set a specified target earnings per share amount for fiscal year 2006 that must be achieved with respect to vesting of the following: (i) one-third of the 200,000 shares of performance-based restricted shares awarded to Kay Krill on October 1, 2005 and (ii) one-third of the 50,000 shares of performance-based restricted shares and one-third of the 50,000 performance-vesting stock options awarded to Laura Weil pursuant to her August 29, 2005 letter agreement with the Company.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that total net sales for the five-week period ended April 1, 2006 increased 10.5 percent to $212.5 million over total net sales of $192.3 million for the five-week period ended April 2, 2005. By division, net sales were $84.0 million for Ann Taylor compared to $79.4 million last year, and $105.1 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $92.7 million last year.
New York, New York, April 6, 2006
Comparable store sales for the period increased 0.8 percent compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 1.7 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal March 2006 were up 5.7 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 3.3 percent decrease last year, and down 2.6 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to being flat last year.
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "The Ann Taylor division posted its eighth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales in March, driven by continued strength in dresses, skirts and suits. At LOFT, our spring offering with its emphasis on novelty and embellishment continued to resonate with our client, though we would have benefited from having more depth in certain fashion categories. Clearly our March volume was impacted by Easter falling in April this year. As a result of the calendar shift we believe the combination of March and April sales is a better barometer of spring selling for our brands."
Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 824 stores in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also Online Stores at www.anntaylor.com and www.anntaylorLOFT.com as of the end of Fiscal 2005.

3.
Administration.
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board"). The Committee shall consist solely of two or more members of the Board, each of whom shall be an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, a "nonemployee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3, as from time to time amended, promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and an "independent director" within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.
The Committee shall have the authority in its discretion, subject to and not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Plan, to administer the Plan and to exercise all the powers and authorities either specifically granted to it under the Plan or necessary or advisable in the administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, the authority to grant Options and to make awards of Restricted Shares and Restricted Units ("Restricted Stock Awards" and "Restricted Unit Awards," respectively, and sometimes collectively with the grant of Options, "Grants"); to determine the purchase price of the shares of Common Stock covered by each Option (the "Option Price"); to determine the persons to whom, and the time or times at which, Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Unit Awards shall be granted; to determine the number of shares to
 
be covered by each Option and to determine the number of Restricted Shares and Restricted Units to be covered by each Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Unit Award; to interpret the Plan; to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; to determine the terms and provisions of the agreements (which need not be identical) entered into in connection with grants of Options ("Option Agreements") and Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Unit Awards ("Restricted Award Agreements"); and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the provisions of Section 6(j)), the Committee shall not have the authority to reduce the exercise price for any Option by repricing or replacing such Option unless the Corporation shall have obtained the prior consent of its stockholders.
The determinations of the Committee shall be binding and conclusive on all parties. The Committee may delegate to one or more of its members or to one or more agents such administrative duties as it may deem advisable, and the Committee or any person to whom it has delegated duties as aforesaid may employ one or more persons to render advice with respect to any responsibility the Committee or such person may have under the Plan.

4.
Eligibility.
Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Unit Awards may be granted to employees (including, without limitation, officers who are employees) of the Corporation or its present or future divisions and Subsidiary Corporations, and to Eligible Directors. In determining the persons to whom Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Unit Awards shall be granted and the number of shares to be covered by each Option and the number of Restricted Shares and Restricted Units to be covered by each Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Unit Award, the Committee shall take into account the duties of the respective persons, their present and potential contributions to the success of the Corporation and such other factors as the Committee shall deem relevant in connection with accomplishing the purpose of the Plan. A person to whom an Option has been granted hereunder is sometimes referred to herein as an "Optionee."
A Grantee shall be eligible to receive more than one Grant during the term of the Plan, but only on the terms and subject to the restrictions hereinafter set forth.

.
The shares of Common Stock subject to Options and Restricted Stock Awards hereunder may, in whole or in part, be authorized but unissued shares or shares that shall have been or may be reacquired by the Corporation. Subject to the next sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock as to which Options, Restricted Shares and Restricted Units may be granted from time to time under this Plan shall not exceed 5,500,000, of which no more than an aggregate of 1,760,000 shares may be used for grants of Restricted Shares and Restricted Units. The limitations established by the preceding sentence shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6(j) or 7(f) hereof, as applicable. Under the Plan, no single employee may be granted Options covering more than 600,000 shares of Common Stock or Restricted Stock and Restricted Unit Awards (constituting performance based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code) covering more than 200,000 shares of Common Stock (subject to any adjustments pursuant to Section 6(j) or 7(f) hereof, as applicable) during any fiscal year of the Corporation.
If any shares subject to an Option grant or Restricted Stock Award are forfeited, canceled, exchanged or surrendered or if a Grant otherwise terminates or expires without a distribution of shares to the Grantee, the shares of Common Stock with respect to such Grant shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture, cancellation, exchange, surrender, termination or expiration, again be available for Grants under the Plan. If any Restricted Units are forfeited, canceled, exchanged or surrendered or if a Restricted Unit Award otherwise terminates or expires without any payment being required to be made with respect to any of the Restricted Units subject thereto, then such Restricted Units (and, if applicable, the Common Stock subject thereto) shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture, cancellation, exchange, surrender, termination or expiration, again be available for Grants
 
under the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the shares of Common Stock available for Grants under the Plan shall be reduced by the following: (i) shares tendered in payment of the exercise price of an award and (ii) shares tendered or withheld in respect of tax withholding obligations.
6.
Terms and Conditions of Options.
Each Option granted pursuant to the Plan shall be evidenced by a written Option Agreement between the Corporation and the Optionee, which agreement shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions (and with such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as the Committee, in its discretion, shall establish):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) If an Acceleration Event (as defined below) shall occur while unexercisable Options remain outstanding under the Plan, such Options not theretofore exercisable by their terms shall become exercisable in full. An "Acceleration Event" shall occur if:

(B) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Corporation to effect a transaction described in clause (A) or (C) of this Section 6(j)(2) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof;
(C) there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other entity other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 80% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or
(D) the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Corporation or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Corporation of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets.
Following the Acceleration Event, the Committee may provide for the cancellation of all Options then outstanding. Upon such cancellation, the Corporation shall make, in exchange for each such Option, a payment either in (i) cash; (ii) shares of the successor entity; or (iii) some combination of cash or shares thereof, at the discretion of the Committee, and in each case in an amount per share subject to such Option equal to the difference between the per share exercise price of such Option and the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of the Acceleration Event.
(3) In the event of a change in the Common Stock of the Corporation as presently constituted which is limited to a change of all of its authorized shares with par value into the same number of shares with a different par value or without par value, the shares resulting from any such change shall be deemed to be the Common Stock within the meaning of the Plan.
(4) The foregoing adjustments shall be made by the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
(5) Except as hereinbefore expressly provided in this Section 6(j), the Optionee shall have no rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class or the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class or by reason of any dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation or spin-off of assets or stock of another corporation; and any issue by the Corporation of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option. The grant of an Option pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Corporation to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structures or to merge or to consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate or sell, or transfer all or part of its business or assets.
 
 
 
7.
Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Unit Awards.
Each Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Unit Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written Restricted Award Agreement between the Corporation and the Grantee, which agreement shall comply with, and be subject to, the following terms and conditions (and with such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as the Committee, in its discretion, shall establish):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8.
Withholding Taxes.
When a Grantee or other person becomes entitled to receive shares of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of an Option or upon the lapse of restrictions relating to a Restricted Stock Award, or to receive a cash payment with respect to a Restricted Unit Award upon the lapse of restrictions relating thereto, the Corporation shall have the right to require the Grantee or such other person to remit to the Corporation an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and local withholding tax requirements related thereto. Unless otherwise prohibited by the Committee or by applicable law, satisfaction of the withholding tax obligation may be accomplished by any of the following methods or by a combination of such methods: (a) tendering a cash payment, (b) authorizing the Corporation to withhold from the shares of Common Stock or cash otherwise payable (1) one or more of such shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date the withholding tax obligation arises, less than or equal to the amount of the minimum withholding tax obligation or (2) cash in an amount less than or equal to the amount of the total withholding tax obligation and (c) delivering to the Corporation shares of Common Stock (provided that such shares shall have been held for at least six months) having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date the withholding tax obligation arises, less than or equal to the amount of the total withholding tax obligation.
9.
Special Vesting Provisions.
To the extent that an Option is to become exercisable, or an award of Restricted Shares or Restricted Units is to vest, based upon the continued employment of the Grantee, such award shall become exercisable or vest (as the case may be) pursuant to a schedule that provides for exercisability or vesting at a rate no more rapid than in three equal increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant (subject to earlier exercisability or vesting upon an Acceleration Event or as may provided in an award agreement with respect to the grantee's death, Disability, Retirement or termination without Cause).
10.
Term of Plan.
Unless terminated earlier by the Board, the term of this Plan shall be 10 years from the date the Plan was adopted. No Option, Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Unit Award shall be granted pursuant to this Plan later than May 1, 2013, but Options, Restricted Shares and Restricted Units theretofore granted may extend beyond that date in accordance with their terms.
11.
Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
The Board may, at any time and from time to time, suspend, terminate, modify or amend the Plan. Except as provided in Section 6 hereof, no suspension, termination, modification or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any Grant previously made, unless the written consent of the Grantee is obtained. Furthermore, except as provided in Section 6 hereof, no modification or amendment of the Plan shall be made that, without the approval of stockholders, would:
(a) increase the total number of shares reserved for the purpose of the Plan;
(b) reduce the exercise price for Options by repricing or replacing such Grants; or
(c) otherwise require approval under applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (or such other national stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is listed).
The Committee shall not have the authority to cancel any outstanding Option and issue a new Option in its place with a lower exercise price; provided, however, that this sentence shall not prohibit an exchange offer whereby the Corporation
 
provides certain Grantees with an election to cancel an outstanding Option and receive a grant of a new Option at a future date if such exchange offer only occurs with stockholder approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have the authority to amend the Plan and any award made hereunder to the extent necessary to cause the Plan or such award to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and such amendment shall not require the consent of the Grantee.
12.
Effective Date.
The Plan was initially adopted on March 11, 2003 by the Board of Directors. The Plan has been amended from time to time thereafter, through March 9, 2006, except that the amendments to the first paragraph of Section 5 shall only become effective if the Corporation's stockholders approve such amendments at the Company's 2006 Annual Meeting.
13.
Miscellaneous.
 
 
 
 
 
14.
Governing Law.
The Plan shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its principles of conflicts of law.

Nothing set forth herein or in the Plan shall (i) confer upon the Grantee any right of continued employment for any period by the Company or any of its divisions or Subsidiary Corporations, (ii) entitle the Grantee to remuneration or benefits not set forth in the Plan, or (iii) interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any such division or Subsidiary Corporation to terminate such Grantee's employment.

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
New York, New York, May 19, 2006
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "We have been working diligently over the past year to execute on initiatives designed to deliver profitable growth by providing our client with brand-appropriate and trend-right product while carefully managing our inventory. In the first quarter we did just that at both Ann Taylor and LOFT. Our first quarter performance was outstanding, and I am delighted to report that both operating and net income more than doubled from last year's first quarter. Based on this strong performance, we are raising our annual earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per diluted share."
For the first quarter ended April 29, 2006, net income was $39.0 million, or $0.53 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 73.0 million shares outstanding), compared to net income of $17.0 million, or $0.24 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 71.6 million shares outstanding) in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Net income for first quarter 2006 was reduced by $0.01 per share to reflect the change in recording compensation expense on stock options and other forms of equity awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R).
The Company's net sales for the quarter totaled $556.2 million, up 16.7 percent from $476.4 million for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were $221.5 million for Ann Taylor compared to $205.7 million last year, and $273.6 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $223.4 million last year. Comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were up 5.6 percent, compared to a decrease of 3.1 percent for the first quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the first quarter were up 7.4 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 4.9 percent decrease last year, and up 4.7 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 1.5 percent decrease last year.

Total inventory levels at the end of the first quarter were down approximately 19 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 14 percent at Ann Taylor and down approximately 21 percent at Ann Taylor LOFT.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 56.6 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to 51.0 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to higher full price sales at both divisions, and higher margin rates achieved on non-full price sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 were $251.6 million, or 45.2 percent of net sales, compared to $215.7 million, or 45.2 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. While we experienced increased leverage on fixed expenses as a result of higher comparable store sales, this was offset by an increase in the provision for management performance bonus.
Operating profit was 11.4 percent of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to 5.8 percent of net sales in the first quarter of last year.
During the first fiscal quarter, the Company opened one Ann Taylor store, eight Ann Taylor LOFT stores and one Ann Taylor Factory store. Additionally, six existing Ann Taylor stores were closed, as were three Ann Taylor LOFT stores and one Ann Taylor Factory store. The total store count at quarter-end was 824, comprised of 352 Ann Taylor stores, 421 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 51 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
Total store square footage increased 11.5 percent to 4.8 million square feet as of April 29, 2006, from 4.3 million square feet as of April 30,2005. Total square footage by division at the end of the first quarter was 1.9 million square feet for Ann Taylor and 2.5 million square feet for Ann Taylor LOFT.
During the first quarter, the Company purchased 700,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $25.2 million. Of the $100 million securities repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in August 2005, approximately $46.5 million remains.
Fiscal Year 2006 Guidance Increased
The Company expects to see fiscal year 2006 comparable store sales increase in the low single-digit range over 2005, with gross margin improvement over last year, primarily in the first half of the year. Additionally, the Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to grow by approximately 12 percent over reported 2005 levels.
ANNTAYLOR
Page 3 of 6
The Company plans to open approximately 10 Ann Taylor stores, 60 LOFT stores and five Ann Taylor Factory Stores, with net square footage growth of approximately seven to eight percent.
Consolidated inventory levels on a per-square-foot basis are expected to be down in the high-teen range from last year at the end of the second quarter and down in the low-single-digit range from last year at the end of the fiscal year.
The Company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 will be in the range of $160 to $165 million, including new store construction, store renovation and re-branding, information systems, corporate office and distribution center initiatives.
Based on the above assumptions, the Company is raising its previous earnings guidance for fiscal 2006 by $0.10 per diluted share and is currently comfortable with a range of $1.70  $1.75. This includes an estimated $0.06 charge to reflect the expensing of stock options. Excluding the impact of stock option expense, earnings per diluted share on an operating basis for fiscal 2006 would be in the range of $1.76 to $1.81. This represents a 40 to 44 percent increase over 2005's $1.26 in diluted earnings per share on an operating basis.
Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 824 stores in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also Online Stores at and as of April 29, 2006.

We entered August in an extremely healthy inventory position.
"The Ann Taylor division delivered its twelfth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales, driven by the strength of suits, skirts, casual separates, petites and accessories. Our focus on transitional colors such as brown and deep red in lightweight fabrics was well received. The LOFT division continued
its excellent momentum, as our emphasis on fashion and great value continued to resonate with clients. Relaxed and casual separates, dresses, petites and sweaters performed exceptionally well."

This marked the second consecutive quarter of reporting the highest earnings in the Company's history. Based on the strong results year to date, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the 2006 fiscal year to $2.05-$2.10 per diluted share."
Second Quarter 2006
For the second quarter ended July 29, 2006, net income reached $43.2 million, or $0.59 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.8 million shares outstanding). This compares to net income of $7.1 million, or $0.10 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.5 million shares outstanding) in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, which included a charge of $9.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, related to the relocation of the Company's corporate offices. Net income for second quarter 2006 was reduced by $0.02 per share to reflect the change in recording compensation expense on stock options and other forms of equity awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R).
The Company's net sales for the quarter totaled $610.0 million, up 19.9 percent from $508.7 million for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were $224.6 million for Ann Taylor compared to $212.2 million last year, and $315.5 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $245.4 million last year. Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were up 10.3 percent. By division, comparable store sales for the second quarter were up 6.4 percent for Ann Taylor and up 14.2 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT.
Total inventory levels at the end of the second quarter were down approximately 17 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 17 percent at Ann Taylor and down approximately 14 percent at Ann Taylor LOFT.
Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 54.2 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to 47.5 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2005. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher full price sales at both divisions, and higher margin rates achieved on non-full price sales, based on the Company's strong product coupled with effective inventory management.

Selling, general and administrative expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 were $262.6 million, or 43.0 percent of net sales, compared to $231.1 million, or 45.4 percent of net sales, for the same period last year which included the $9.5 million charge due to the relocation of the Company's corporate offices. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2006 was primarily due to the combined effect of the absence of the 2005 corporate office relocation charge and leverage from an increase in comparable store sales partially offset by an increase in management performance bonus.
Operating profit was 11.2 percent of net sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to 2.1 percent of net sales in the second quarter of last year.
During the second fiscal quarter, the Company opened two Ann Taylor stores, six Ann Taylor LOFT stores and one Ann Taylor Factory store. Additionally, four existing Ann Taylor stores and one Ann Taylor LOFT store were closed. The total store count at quarter-end was 828, comprised of 350 Ann Taylor stores, 426 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 52 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
Total store square footage increased 8.0 percent to 4.8 million square feet as of July 29, 2006, from 4.5 million square feet as of July 30, 2005. Total square footage by division at the end of the second quarter was 1.9 million square feet for Ann Taylor and 2.5 million square feet for Ann Taylor LOFT.
During the second quarter, the Company purchased 750,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $29.6 million. For the first half of 2006, the Company purchased 1,450,000 of its common stock at a cost of approximately $54.8 million.
First Half of 2006
For the first six months of the fiscal year, the period ended July 29, 2006, the Company's net income more than tripled to $82.2 million, or $1.13 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.9 million shares outstanding). This compares to net income of $24.1 million, or $0.33 per share on a diluted basis (on an average of 72.0 million shares outstanding), for the same period last year, which included a charge of $9.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, related to the relocation of the Company's corporate offices. Net income for the 2006 first half was reduced by $0.03 per share to reflect the change in recording compensation expense on stock options and other forms of equity awards in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R).
Net sales for the 2006 six-month period totaled $1.2 billion, up 18.4 percent from $985.1 million in the same period last year. By division, net sales for the first half of 2006 were $446.1 million for Ann Taylor compared to $418.0 million last year, and $589.2 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $468.8 million last year. Comparable store sales for the first half of 2006 increased 8.0 percent over the same period last year. Comparable store sales by division were up 6.9 percent for Ann Taylor and up 9.7 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the six-month period of 2006 was 55.4 percent, compared to 49.2 percent in the same period of 2005. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher full price sales at both divisions, and higher margin rates achieved on non-full price sales, based on the Company's strong product coupled with effective inventory management.
Selling, general and administrative expenses in the first half of 2006 were $514.2 million, or 44.1 percent of net sales, compared to $446.8 million, or 45.4 percent of net sales for the same period last year, which included the $9.5 million second quarter charge for the relocation of the Company's corporate offices. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2006 was primarily due to the combined effect of the absence of the 2005 corporate office relocation charge and leverage on higher comparable store sales partially offset by an increase in management performance bonus.
Operating profit was 11.3 percent of net sales in the first half of fiscal 2006 compared to 3.8 percent of net sales in the same period last year.

Stock Repurchase
Reflecting the Company's strong outlook and the Board of Director's continued confidence in the Company's future growth, as well as its strong cash position, the Board has authorized a new $125 million share repurchase program that replaces the Company's previous program. The Company views the repurchase of shares as an additional means of returning value to shareholders.
Fiscal Year 2006 Guidance Increased
The Company expects comparable store sales for the second half of 2006 to increase in the low single-digit range over 2005, which would result in a comparable store sales increase for the full year 2006 in the mid-single-digit range over 2005.
Gross margin for the second half of the year is expected to improve slightly over the second half of 2005. The Company continues to expect the full year to show solid improvement over last year, driven by the significant increase achieved in gross margin in the first half of 2006.
Additionally, the Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to grow in 2006 by approximately 13-14 percent over reported 2005 levels. The increase is due largely to investment in new stores, higher performance-based compensation, costs related to the higher sales in the spring season, and the cost associated with options expense.
For the full year, the Company plans to open approximately 55-60 LOFT stores, 10 Ann Taylor stores, and 5 Ann Taylor Factory Stores, implying total net square footage growth of approximately 7 percent.
Consolidated inventory levels on a per-square-foot basis are expected to be down at year end in the mid single-digit range.
The Company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 will be in the range of $160-$165 million, including new store construction, store renovation and re-branding, information systems, corporate office and distribution center initiatives as well as other general corporate investments.
Based on the above assumptions, the Company now expects its fully diluted earnings per share for the year to be in a range of $2.05$2.10 with opportunity for most of the earnings increase in the second half coming in the fourth quarter. This increased guidance includes an estimated $0.06 charge to reflect the expensing of stock options. Excluding the impact of stock option expense, expected earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2006 would be in the range of $2.11 to $2.16. This represents a 67-71 percent increase over 2005's $1.26 in diluted earnings per share on an operating basis.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
- AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that total net sales for the four-week period ended August 26, 2006 increased 11.2 percent to $149.2 million over total net sales of $134.1 for the four-week period ended August 27, 2005. By division, net sales were $56.6 million for Ann Taylor compared to $53.1 million last year, and $73.5 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $66.8 million last year.
New York, New York, August 31, 2006
Comparable store sales for the period increased 1.9 percent compared to a comparable store sales increase of 3.7 percent for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for August 2006 were up 6.9 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 5.6 percent increase last year, and declined 1.0 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 1.9 percent increase last year.
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We entered August in an extremely healthy inventory position, which enabled us to continue our focus on driving full-price sales and higher gross margin, including the elimination of our traditional 50 percent clearance event in both divisions. Ann Taylor delivered its thirteenth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales with the results for the month benefiting from the early receipt of fall product. Suits, cropped pants, skirts, shoes and accessories have been particularly well-received. At LOFT, we achieved a solid increase in full-price sales, while non-full price sales decreased from last year as a result of much less clearance inventory. Our wear-now selection of dresses, relaxed separates, cropped pants and knit tops has performed well, and our fall collection is now in stores as of the first week of September."

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
- AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that total net sales for the five-week period ended September 30, 2006 increased 13.9 percent to $232.3 million over total net sales of $204.0 million for the five-week period ended October 1, 2005. By division, net sales were $92.3 million for Ann Taylor compared to $84.0 million last year, and $110.2 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $99.1 million last year.
New York, New York, October 5, 2006
Comparable store sales for the period increased 5.8 percent compared to a comparable store sales decrease of 2.7 percent for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for September 2006 were up 9.6 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 4.0 percent increase last year, and were up 1.4 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to an 8.5 percent decline last year.
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with our overall results for the month of September. The Ann Taylor division achieved its fourteenth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales, with all geographic regions contributing to the increase. We saw strength across our full product offering, highlighted by the exceptional performance of suits, pants, dresses, shoes and accessories. At LOFT, the positive comparable store sales were driven by strong selling of pants including key fashion styles, knit tops and petites, offset by lower-than-expected results in the sweater category, where new fashion silhouettes were not well received."

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that total net sales for the four-week period ended October 28, 2006 increased 5.1 percent to $184.8 million over total net sales of $175.9 million for the four-week period ended October 29, 2005. By division, net sales were $74.3 million for Ann Taylor compared to $72.9 million last year, and $88.8 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $86.0 million last year.
New York, New York, November 2, 2006
Comparable store sales for October 2006 decreased 0.5 percent, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 1.2 percent for the same four-week period in 2005. By division, comparable store sales were up 1.5 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 2.2 percent increase last year, and down 3.4 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 1.7 percent increase last year.
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "At both divisions, we continued our strategy of focusing on profitable sales growth. At Ann Taylor, October represented the fifteenth consecutive month of positive comparable store sales, highlighted by a solid increase in full-price sales. We saw strength across the offering with good results in dresses, suits, separates, shoes and accessories. At LOFT, sales results continued to be negatively impacted by the poor performance of sweaters, especially in new fashion silhouettes. Going forward, we believe we have a better balance of wardrobe essentials and color in the sweater category for the fourth quarter. LOFT's comparable store sales for the month were also negatively affected by a shortened redemption period for the LOFT savings card versus last year. Dresses, pants, knit tops and knit dressing all performed well at LOFT for the month."

The Company will release its third quarter fiscal 2006 results on Friday, November 17, 2006, before the market opens.

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated November 17, 2006. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.
 
99.1     Press Release issued by AnnTaylor Stores Corporation on November 17, 2006.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 
- AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
New York, New York, November 17, 2006
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "We are very pleased with our overall results for the quarter, with significant increases in sales and gross margin driving the best third quarter earnings performance in our Company's history. With these results, we continued the solid momentum we have generated this year. The third quarter was highlighted by Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Factory and our Online business, with each delivering a particularly strong performance. These results were partially offset by a less than robust quarter at LOFT, due primarily to softness in the sweater category. We look forward to continuing to execute our growth strategies and to further building our Ann Taylor, LOFT and Ann Taylor Factory brands."
Third Quarter 2006
For the third quarter ended October 28, 2006, net income advanced 29 percent to $39.3 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to net income of $30.3 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2005.
The Company's net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 totaled $566.3 million, up 10.2 percent from $514.0 million for the same period last year. By division, net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were $223.3 million for Ann Taylor compared to $210.0 million last year, and $272.5 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $251.9 million last year. Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2006 were up 2.6 percent, compared to an increase of 0.2 percent for the third quarter of last year. By division, comparable store sales for the third quarter were up 6.1 percent for Ann Taylor compared to a 3.7 percent increase last year, and down 0.9 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 2.5 percent decrease last year.
Total inventory levels at the end of the third quarter were down approximately 3 percent on a per square foot basis compared to the same period last year. By division, inventory levels on a per square foot basis were down approximately 13 percent at Ann Taylor and up approximately 8 percent at Ann Taylor LOFT.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 56.6 percent in the third quarter, compared to 54.2 percent in the third quarter last year. The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to an increase in full-price sales across all divisions.

SG&A expenses in the third quarter of 2006 were $259.0 million, or 45.7 percent of net sales, compared to $228.7 million, or 44.5 percent of net sales, for the same period last year. The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher marketing and increased stock- and performance-based compensation costs, partially offset by leverage on fixed expenses at Ann Taylor due to the increase in comparable store sales.
Operating profit was 10.9 percent of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 compared to 9.7 percent of net sales in the third quarter of last year.
During the third fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company opened seven Ann Taylor stores, 19 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and four Ann Taylor Factory stores. Additionally, two existing Ann Taylor stores were closed. The total store count at quarter-end was 856, comprised of 355 Ann Taylor stores, 445 Ann Taylor LOFT stores and 56 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
Total store square footage increased 5.4 percent to 5.0 million square feet as of October 28, 2006, from 4.7 million square feet as of October 29, 2005. Total square footage by division at the end of the third quarter was 1.9 million square feet for Ann Taylor and 2.6 million square feet for Ann Taylor LOFT.
Nine Month Results
For the fiscal year-to-date period ending October 28, 2006, the Company's net income was $121.5 million, or $1.67 per diluted share, compared to net income of $54.5 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the same period last year.
Fiscal year-to-date net sales totaled $1.7 billion, up 15.6 percent in 2006 from $1.5 billion. By division, net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period were $669.3 for Ann Taylor compared to $628.0 million last year, and $861.7 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $720.7 million last year. Comparable store sales for the fiscal year-to-date period increased 6.2 percent from the same period last year. Comparable store sales by division were up 6.6 percent for Ann Taylor and up 6.0 percent for Ann Taylor LOFT.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales for the fiscal year-to-date period ending October 28, 2006 was 55.8 percent, compared to 50.9 percent for the same period last year. This increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to higher full-price sales across all divisions combined with higher margin rates on non-full price sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 44.6 percent for the fiscal 2006 year-to-date period compared to 45.1 percent for the same period last year. This decrease was primarily due to the benefits of fixed cost leverage, given the increase in comparable store sales, and the absence of the corporate office relocation charge that unfavorably impacted the 2005 period. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher stock- and performance-based compensation expenses in the 2006 period.
Stock Repurchase
During the third fiscal quarter of 2006, the Company purchased approximately 751,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $30.3 million.

Based on the strong third quarter results, the Company has raised its guidance range for full year 2006 diluted earnings per share. The revised guidance is based upon the fourth quarter assumptions outlined below.

Page 3 of 6
 
Comparable store sales for the fourth quarter are expected to be flat compared to the increase of 6.8% for the same period last year. For the year, as previously stated, comparable store sales are expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range.
Gross margin rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter of 2005. The Company continues to expect the full year to show great improvement over last year, driven by the significant increase achieved in gross margin in the first nine months of 2006.
Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase approximately 9% in the fourth quarter versus the same period last year. For the full year, the Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to grow approximately 13 percent over reported 2005 levels. The increase is due largely to investment in new stores, higher stock- and performance-based compensation costs and costs related to the higher sales in the spring season.
For the full year, the Company plans to open approximately 52 LOFT stores, 11 Ann Taylor stores, and seven Ann Taylor Factory Stores, implying total net square footage growth of approximately 6 percent.
Consolidated inventory levels on a per-square-foot basis are expected to be down at year-end in the mid single-digit range.
The Company anticipates that capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 will be approximately $165 million, including new store construction, store renovation and re-branding, information systems, corporate office and distribution center initiatives as well as other general corporate investments.
Based on the above assumptions, the Company now expects its fully diluted earnings per share for the year to be in the range of $2.07 to $2.12, compared with the $2.05 to $2.10 range previously expected. This EPS outlook includes an estimated $0.06 charge to reflect the expensing of stock options. Excluding the impact of stock option expense, expected earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2006 would be in the range of $2.13 to $2.18.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Ann Taylor Announces November 2006 Sales Results
 
 
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE:ANN) announced today that net sales for the four-week period ended November 25, 2006 increased 2.1% to $186.4 million, compared with net sales of $182.5 million for the four-week period ended November 26, 2005. By division, net sales were $73.3 million for Ann Taylor compared to $76.2 million last year, and $86.2 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $86.1 million last year.
New York, New York, November 30, 2006
Comparable store sales for November 2006 declined 4.3% compared to a comparable store sales increase of 12.9% for the same four-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal November 2006 were down 3.4% for Ann Taylor compared to an 18.6% increase last year, and down 7.7% for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 10.2% increase last year.
Kay Krill, President & Chief Executive Officer of Ann Taylor, stated, "The month of November got off to a slow start, particularly in the context of the very strong November we reported last year. As expected, the unusually warm weather in much of the country negatively impacted results in weather-sensitive categories such as sweaters, outerwear and cold weather accessories at both Ann Taylor and LOFT. Our sales trend picked up in the latter part of the month, and our performance on Black Friday was strong at both divisions. For the month, Ann Taylor continued to successfully drive increased full-price sales, while LOFT continued to clear through remaining fall sweater inventory. Our December store set for both divisions will be in stores this week, with the new merchandise at Ann Taylor having a wear-to-work focus, and the new merchandise at LOFT having a more casual focus. We believe that these new store sets, which are consistent with our clients' wardrobing needs, will help to build our sales momentum as the holiday season unfolds."

EXHIBIT 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) announced today that net sales for the five-week period ended December 30, 2006 increased 2.4% to $274.2 million, compared with net sales of $267.7 million for the five-week period ended December 31, 2005. By division, net sales were $109.1 million for Ann Taylor compared to $114.5 million last year, and $130.9 million for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to $128.8 million last year.
New York, New York, January 4, 2007
Comparable store sales for December 2006 declined 5.3% compared to a comparable store sales increase of 1.5% for the same five-week period last year. By division, comparable store sales for fiscal December 2006 were down 4.2% for Ann Taylor compared to a 2.3% increase last year, and down 8.1% for Ann Taylor LOFT compared to a 1.6% increase last year.
Commenting on the December sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "December was clearly our most challenging month of the year. Our results for both brands were soft in the cold weather categories of sweaters, outerwear and cold weather accessories, compared to strong demand for these products in 2005. Our gifting business, which is largely focused on sweaters, outerwear and accessories, was slower than we have historically experienced and was below expectations for the holiday period. For the month, the Ann Taylor division had strong results in wear to work merchandise, especially suits, as well as strength in special occasion separates. LOFT's results continued to be especially disappointing in sweaters, outerwear and accessories. We continue to clear through existing LOFT merchandise and are committed to entering February 2007 in a healthy inventory position."
The Company indicated that, as a result of the December softness, it now expects full year EPS for fiscal 2006 to be somewhat below its previous guidance range of $2.07 to $2.12. Nevertheless, given the strength of the first three quarters, the Company continues to expect 2006 to be a record year.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of January 2007 and the full fiscal year 2006. The Company noted that fiscal 2006 represented a 53-week period, while fiscal 2005 represented a 52-week period.
New York, New York, February 8, 2007
For the five-week period ended February 3, 2007, net sales increased 21.0% to $149.9 million, compared with net sales of $123.9 million for the four-week period ended January 28, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor were up 10.5% to $61.0 million in January 2007, compared with net sales of $55.2 million in January 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales were up 20.1% to $67.7 million in January 2007, compared with net sales of $56.3 million in January 2006.
Comparable store sales for the four-week period ended January 27, 2007 declined 10.2%, compared with a comparable store sales increase of 10.9% for the four-week period ended January 28, 2006. By division, comparable store sales decreased 13.0% for Ann Taylor in the January 2007 period, compared with an increase of 15.7% in the prior year. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales decreased 12.5% in January 2007, compared with an increase of 8.4% in the prior year.
Commenting on the January sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "January was clearly a disappointing month from a comparable store sales perspective. However, our Ann Taylor division continued to experience strength in full-price sales and increased gross margin versus the prior year, while LOFT, on the other hand, continued to experience weakness. The soft January comp at Ann Taylor was directly related to not offering the 40% off promotional event we ran last January due to this year's healthy inventory position. Ann Taylor's full-price product performed very well for the month, with strong comp performance achieved across most categories. At LOFT, we continued to struggle with our full-price assortment, which was not wear now and did not offer enough updated classics. The division also aggressively promoted Fall and Holiday product throughout the month. As we enter fiscal 2007, we are pleased with our Spring product for Ann Taylor, and we believe that LOFT will continue to be challenged by both a lack of wear now product and updated classics during the Spring season."

For the full fiscal year 2006, net sales increased 13.0% to $2,342.9 million, versus net sales of $2,073.1 million for the full fiscal year 2005. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor were up 4.4% to $912.8 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $873.9 million in fiscal 2005. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales were up 15.6% to $1,146.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared with $991.9 million in fiscal 2005.
Comparable store sales for the 52-week period ended January 27, 2007 increased 2.8%, compared with a comparable store sales increase of 0.1% for the 52-week period ended January 28, 2006. By division, comparable store sales increased 3.1% for Ann Taylor in fiscal 2006, compared with an increase of 0.6% in fiscal 2005. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales increased 1.9% in fiscal 2006, compared with a decrease of 0.3% in fiscal 2005.
Commenting on the full year results, Kay Krill continued, "We are pleased with our overall performance in fiscal 2006, and we continue to expect the year to be a record one. Our Ann Taylor division had a very strong year, as did our Factory and Online businesses. At Ann Taylor, the division's success throughout the year in providing clients with a better product assortment resulted in increased full-price sales and higher margins. Our LOFT division had a terrific first half this past year, but the momentum stalled in the back half, as our product mix was too heavily focused on fashion versus updated classics. Nevertheless, the progress we made all year in strengthening the Company's overall business and improving our margin structure enabled us to deliver a year of record financial performance."
The Company indicated that, for the full fiscal year 2006, it expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.95 to $1.98, marking the best earnings performance in the Company's history.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of February 2007.
New York, New York, March 8, 2007
For the four-week period ended March 3, 2007, net sales increased 4.6% to $136.1 million, compared with net sales of $130.1 million for the four-week period ended February 25, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor were up 1.4% to $54.6 million in February 2007, compared with net sales of $53.9 million in February 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales declined 1.3% to $60.8 million in February 2007, compared with net sales of $61.6 million in February 2006.
For the four-week period ended March 3, 2007, comparable store sales declined 2.9%, versus a comparable store sales gain of 5.6% in the four-week period ended February 25, 2006. By division, comparable store sales increased 2.4% for Ann Taylor in the February 2007 period, compared with an increase of 9.8% in the prior year. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales decreased 10.6% in February 2007, compared with an increase of 4.2% in the prior year.
Commenting on the February sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "As we expected, our overall February comp store sales results continued to reflect softness at LOFT, due to a product assortment that lacks the appropriate balance of updated classics, wear now and color. Conversely, our Ann Taylor division's product assortment is clearly resonating with our clients, and we continue to deliver increased full-price sales and higher gross margin. Our full-price business at Ann Taylor was driven by the wear-to-work categories of suits, separates and dresses, and our overall momentum picked up considerably in the back half of the month as we headed into March. We continue to be pleased with our performance at Ann Taylor, as well as the performance of our Factory and online businesses, and we are working aggressively to get the LOFT product assortment back on track."

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2006 ending February 3, 2007. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.31 and, for the year, diluted earnings per share reached a record level of $1.98. Net sales for the quarter were up 6% and, for the year, net sales advanced 13% to a record level of $2.3 billion.
New York, NY, March 16, 2007
 
 
 
 
 
 
Commenting on the results of the year, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "Fiscal 2006 was a year of record financial performance and accomplishment for the Company. We continued to strengthen and grow our brands, improve our gross margin, and increase our supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. We successfully managed through a tough fourth quarter, given the impact of the unseasonably warm weather across much of the country and a fashion miss at LOFT, and we have entered fiscal 2007 determined to build on the progress we made in 2006 to deliver another year of record financial performance."

Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 ending February 3, 2007 advanced 6.3% to $610.5 million, compared with net sales of $574.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 ending January 28, 2006. The Company indicated that, due to the timing of its fiscal calendar, the 2006 fourth quarter and fiscal full year included an extra week, versus the comparable fiscal 2005 periods.
By division, net sales at Ann Taylor declined 1.0% to $243.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with net sales of $245.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. At LOFT, net sales grew 5.0% to $284.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with net sales of $271.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.
Comparable store sales on a 13-week basis declined 6.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 6.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor declined 5.9% in the fiscal 2006 quarter, compared with a 9.8% increase in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to the unusually warm weather across much of the country during the quarter and the resultant impact on the division's weather-sensitive categoriesnamely, sweaters, outerwear and cold-weather accessories. Importantly, Ann Taylor's success in offering brand-appropriate product and tightly managing inventory enabled the division to achieve increased full-price sales and higher margins across the balance of its business. At LOFT, comparable store sales declined 8.9% in the fiscal 2006 quarter, compared with a 5.5% increase in the year-ago quarter. As previously disclosed, the softness at LOFT largely reflected a merchandise assortment, most notably sweaters, that was too heavily focused on fashion and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the unusually warm weather on weather-sensitive merchandise.
During the quarter, the company opened 19 LOFT stores, one Ann Taylor store, and one Ann Taylor Factory store and closed eight Ann Taylor stores. The total store count at the end of the quarter was 869, comprised of 348 Ann Taylor stores, 464 LOFT stores and 57 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 3.4 margin points to 47.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, compared with a gross margin of 51.0% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The decline in gross margin primarily reflected aggressive promotional activity at LOFT, stemming from the fashion miss in sweaters and the resultant focus throughout the quarter on clearing inventory. Partially offsetting the LOFT margin weakness was aggressive growth and significantly higher margins at the Company's Factory and Internet businesses, as well as higher margins at Ann Taylor.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 were $260.0 million, or 42.6% of net sales, compared to $249.5 million, or 43.5% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. This decline as a percentage of net sales largely reflected the absence of one-time costs totaling $6.5 million related to a legal settlement that impacted 2005, partially offset by an overall deleveraging of fixed expenses.
Operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 declined 29.3% to $30.5 million, or 5.0% of net sales, compared to operating income of $43.2 million, or 7.5% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 was $21.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with net income of $27.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. Operating income in the fiscal 2005 quarter included charges totaling approximately $6.5 million relating to a legal settlement, with the impact on net income in the year-ago quarter totaling approximately $3.9 million. On a diluted share basis, the impact of this item in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 was $0.05.
During the fourth quarter, the Company substantially completed its $125 million share repurchase program, having purchased approximately 2.8 million shares of its common stock at an approximate cost of $95 million.
For the full year of fiscal 2006, which included 53 weeks, net sales advanced 13.0% to $2.3 billion, compared with net sales of $2.1 billion for the full year of fiscal 2005, which included 52 weeks. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor grew 4.4% to $912.8 million in fiscal 2006, compared with net sales of $873.9 million in fiscal 2005. At LOFT, net sales increased 15.6% to $1,146.5 million in fiscal 2006, compared with net sales of $991.9 million in fiscal 2005.
Comparable store sales on a 52-week basis grew 2.8% in fiscal 2006, compared to comparable store sales growth of 0.1% on the same basis in fiscal 2005. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor grew 3.1% in fiscal 2006, compared to a 0.6% increase in fiscal 2005 and, at LOFT, comparable store sales increased 1.9%, compared to a decline of 0.3% in fiscal 2005.
During fiscal 2006, the Company opened a total of 70 new stores and closed a total of 25 stores, ending the year at a store count of 869 stores. Ann Taylor opened 11 new stores during the year and closed 20 older ones, while LOFT opened 52 new stores and closed four, and Factory opened seven new stores and closed one. In addition, during the year, the Company updated 63 Ann Taylor stores, bringing to 106 the total number of Ann Taylor stores updated, since the rebranding program was initiated in 2005.

Total Company store square footage for fiscal 2006 increased 5.8% to 5.1 million square feet, versus 4.8 million square feet at fiscal year-end 2005. By division, total square footage at the end of fiscal 2006 was 1.9 million for Ann Taylor and 2.8 million for LOFT.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales advanced 2.8 margin points to 53.7% in fiscal 2006, versus 50.9% in fiscal 2005. The improvement in gross margin largely reflected the Company's success throughout the year in improving its product offering and managing its inventory at Ann Taylor. Also driving the improvement in gross margin was the successful conversion during the year of Ann Taylor Factory to a full-price business and the continued growth and margin expansion of the Company's Internet businesses.
At the end of fiscal 2006, total inventory on a per square foot basis increased 8%, compared to a decrease of 22% at the end of fiscal 2005. By division, Ann Taylor inventory on a per square foot basis at year-end 2006 was down 2%, on top of the 18% decline achieved at year-end 2005. Conversely, at LOFT, year-end inventory on a per square foot basis increased 16%, versus the 23% reduction achieved at year-end 2005, largely due to the division's fourth quarter fashion miss and the impact of timing related to LOFT's in-transit Spring inventory versus a year ago.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 were $1,033 million, or 44.1% of net sales, compared to $925 million, or 44.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. This decline as a percentage of net sales largely reflected the benefit of fixed cost leverage, stemming from the increase in comparable store sales, and the absence of costs totaling $16 million associated with the relocation of the Company's corporate headquarters and a one-time charge related to a legal settlement in the year-ago period. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher stock- and performance-based compensation expenses in 2006.
Operating income advanced approximately 71% to $223.8 million, or 9.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2006, versus operating income of $131 million, or 6.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2005. Net income increased 75% to $143.0 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, versus net income of $81.9 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, in fiscal 2005. Operating income in fiscal 2005 included costs totaling approximately $16.0 million relating to the 2005 corporate office relocation and a legal settlement, with the impact on net income in fiscal 2005 totaling $9.5 million. On a diluted share basis, the impact of these items was $0.13 in fiscal 2005.
During fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased nearly five million shares of its common stock at an approximate cost of $180 million.

The Company's outlook for earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2007 is in the range of $2.15 to $2.25. This performance is expected to reflect the impact of some softness from LOFT in the first half, followed by improving trends for the division in the second half of the year. The primary drivers of the Company's outlook for fiscal 2007 are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In support of the Company's outlook for fiscal 2007, it plans to open approximately 10 to 15 Ann Taylor stores, 60 LOFT stores and 10 Ann Taylor Factory Stores. The Company plans to close approximately 10 stores in fiscal 2007. In addition, the Company plans to update approximately 90 additional Ann Taylor stores during fiscal 2007. At the end of fiscal 2007, the Company expects over 70% of the Ann Taylor store base to be updated and brand-appropriate.
The Company indicated that it is planning the initial rollout of a number of strategic initiatives in fiscal 2007 that, collectively, have the potential to benefit its results beginning in fiscal 2008. At Ann Taylor, these initiatives include expanding the division's successful Celebrations
line and introducing a new Ann Taylor Beauty collection, consisting of fragrance and bath and body products, that will be available in all Ann Taylor stores beginning late this year or early next year. At LOFT, the Company is planning the launch this summer of a LOFT maternity line in select stores and online.
Looking further out, the Company indicated that it is moving forward with the launch of a new concept targeted at what the Company believes is a very attractive untapped opportunity in the market today. The new concept is targeted to be rolled out in Fall 2008. Additionally, the Company indicated that it is planning to expand its Factory business to include a LOFT Factory concept, with the initial rollout currently slated for Summer 2008.

Commenting on the Company's growth initiatives, Ms. Krill stated, "We are very excited about the significant growth potential we see in the business across our brands. We have made terrific progress turning around Ann Taylor and, with this accomplished, we are now in a position to expand the brand to drive attractive growth for years to come. At LOFT, we are entering Spring 2007 with a focus on regaining our momentum, while we continue to expand our store base and extend the brand into additional categories that make strategic sense for our clients. Our Factory business continues to extend the reach of our Ann Taylor brand to an additional client base, and we are excited about the opportunity to do the same with the LOFT brand. As we look ahead, clearly the most meaningful opportunity we are pursuing is the launch of our new concept in Fall 2008. We are very excited about delivering on the enormous growth potential we see, and we believe our outlook is extremely bright."
The Company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a $300 million share repurchase program, enabling the Company to buy its stock in the open market or in private transactions from time to time.
"This is the largest share repurchase program in Ann Taylor's history. We have thoroughly evaluated our capital structure, along with the cash we generate from operations and the capital requirements to fund our growth strategy, and we believe that this program is another excellent way to deliver value for our shareholders," stated Ms. Krill.

On March 14, 2007, the Compensation Committee established performance goals and target award percentages for each participant eligible to earn cash bonuses under the Company's Management Performance Compensation Plan ("Performance Compensation Plan") and 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan.
The bonuses payable to the "named executive officers" (as defined in Item 402 of Regulation S-K) under the Performance Compensation Plan are based on the achievement of certain company-wide net income goals approved by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee also designated annual performance targets for cycles under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan based on a combination of return on net assets and earnings per share that must be achieved for incentive compensation to be paid for such cycles.
Under the Performance Compensation Plan, a named executive officer's incentive target is a percentage of his/her base salary ranging from 60% to 110% depending on corporate title and responsibilities.
Performance Measures established for Restricted Stock
The Compensation Committee set earnings per share as the performance metric for fiscal year 2007 to be achieved with respect to vesting of one-third of the 200,000 shares of performance-based restricted shares awarded to Ms. Krill on October 1, 2005. The Compensation Committee also set earnings per share as the performance metric for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009 relating to the vesting of 25,000 shares of performance-based restricted stock granted to Ms. Krill on March 15, 2007. These performance-based restricted shares will vest in three equal annual installments if the Company achieves the respective target for the applicable fiscal year.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of March 2007.
New York, New York, April 12, 2007
For the five-week period ended April 7, 2007, net sales increased 14.8% to $243.9 million, compared with net sales of $212.5 million for the five-week period ended April 1, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor were up 8.5% to $91.1 million in March 2007, compared with net sales of $84.0 million in March 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales increased 11.1% to $116.9 million in March 2007, compared with net sales of $105.1 million in March 2006.
Comparable store sales for the March 2007 period increased 6.1%, versus a comparable store sales gain of 0.8% in the March 2006 period. By division, comparable store sales increased 8.9% for Ann Taylor in the 2007 period, compared with an increase of 5.7% the prior year. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales increased 0.4% in March 2007, compared with a decrease of 2.6% the prior year.
Commenting on the March sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "March was a good month for the Company. Our results were helped by the warm weather in the beginning of the month and benefited somewhat by the earlier timing of Easter this year. Our Ann Taylor division continued to offer compelling, brand-appropriate product that resonated with our clients, with dresses, suits, woven and knit tops and accessories especially strong. As a result, the division was again successful in driving higher full-price selling throughout the month. Our LOFT division posted somewhat stronger March results than we had expected, driven by dresses, knit tops, casual separates and shoes, with fashion silhouettes in sweaters and pants still challenging. We expect to see gradual improvement in LOFT's product offering over the course of the next several months."
The Company indicated that it expects its April performance to be somewhat negatively impacted by the timing shift of Easter, which benefited the month of April last year versus the month of March this year.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for April and the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, net sales advanced 4.3% to $580.3 million, compared with net sales of $556.2 million for the first quarter of 2006.

Commenting on the Company's sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "April was a difficult month for the Company. Following good results in March, our performance heading into April and for much of the month was soft, primarily due to the record cold temperatures across the country, as well as the earlier timing of Easter this year and continued softness at LOFT. For the quarter, our Ann Taylor division achieved a positive comp, delivering balanced product assortments that drove higher full-price selling. Our key wear-to-work categories and dresses were especially strong for the quarter, and we remain confident in our outlook for the division for the balance of the year. At LOFT, our results continued to reflect a product assortment that is not yet fully back on track. As previously communicated, we do expect to see gradual improvement in LOFT's product offering over the course of the next several months heading into Fall."

(e) On May 17, 2007, at the 2007 Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (the "Company"), the Company's stockholders approved the Company's Management Performance Compensation Plan, as amended and restated (the "Performance Compensation Plan"). The Performance Compensation Plan provides for payment of compensation to executive officers and other eligible associates based on the achievement of certain performance goals. Awards under the Performance Compensation Plan are "performance-based" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and will not be subject to the executive compensation deduction limitations thereunder. A description of the material terms of the Performance Compensation Plan was included in the Company's Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 5, 2007.
The above description of the Performance Compensation Plan is not intended to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the specific language in the Performance Compensation Plan, a copy of which is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1, and incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 10.1
1. Purpose.
This Plan is an integral part of the Company's over-all compensation strategy which is aimed at attracting and retaining in the employ of the Company and its Subsidiaries highly motivated, results-oriented personnel of experience and ability, by basing such personnel's compensation, in part, on their contributions to the growth and profitability of the Company, thereby giving them incentive to remain with the Company and its Subsidiaries and to continue to make contributions to the Company in the future. Further, the purpose of the Plan is to serve as a qualified performance-based compensation program under Section 162(m) ("Section 162(m)") of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
2. Definitions.
As used in this Plan, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
 
 
 
(i) any "person", as such term is used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, other than (1) the Company, (2) any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefits plan of the Company, or (3) any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company (in substantially the same proportion as their ownership of shares) (a "Person") is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities;

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated May 24, 2007. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ending May 5, 2007. The Company also reaffirmed its outlook for diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 in the range of $2.15 to $2.25.
New York, NY, May 24, 2007
For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, net sales advanced 4% to $580 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.46, versus diluted earnings per share of $0.53 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
Ann Taylor indicated that, during the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 4.2 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $163 million. Substantially all of the shares repurchased were acquired under the Company's new $300 million share repurchase authorization.
Commenting on the results of the quarter, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "As we expected, our results in the first quarter were mixed. Our Ann Taylor division continued to offer compelling product assortments that resonated with our clients and drove increased full-price selling, while our LOFT division continued to be challenged with a product assortment that was not balanced and did not offer enough updated classics or color. As a result, LOFT was very promotional throughout the quarter, which significantly impacted our gross margin. That said, I am pleased with the progress we are making at LOFT to improve our product assortments, and we continue to expect the division to be back on track for the second half of this year. Operationally and as a whole, the Company is becoming increasingly more efficient, and we have made significant progress in the areas of sourcing and systems. We also continued to deliver value to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. Although we share some of the current concerns regarding potential macroeconomic softening, we are confident in our ability to deliver EPS for the year in our previously-announced range of $2.15 to $2.25."

Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 ending May 5, 2007 advanced 4.3% to $580.3 million, compared with net sales of $556.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 ending April 29, 2006. This performance reflected expansion of the Company's store base and continued growth of the Company's Factory and internet businesses, partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales for the quarter.
By division, net sales at Ann Taylor increased slightly to $222.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $221.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. At LOFT, net sales of $274.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were also up slightly, compared with net sales of $273.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
Comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 declined 3.3%, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 5.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor increased 0.9% in the fiscal 2007 quarter, compared with an increase of 7.4% in the fiscal 2006 quarter, primarily reflecting strength in key wear-to-work categories and dresses, partially offset by softness in sweaters. At LOFT, comparable store sales declined 9.0% in the fiscal 2007 quarter, compared with an increase of 4.7% in the fiscal 2006 quarter, largely reflecting a product assortment that lacked the appropriate balance of updated classics, wear now and color.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was up 9% versus year-ago, primarily due to timing associated with higher inventory in transit at both Ann Taylor and LOFT. In-store inventory on a per square foot basis was even with year-ago. By division, in-store per square foot inventory at Ann Taylor was down approximately 3% and, at LOFT, in-store per square foot inventory was up approximately 4%, stemming from the soft sales performance during the quarter.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 3.0 margin points to 53.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. This decline primarily reflected margin softness at LOFT, partially offset by the benefit of converting Ann Taylor Factory to a full-price destination.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, declined to 45.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 45.2% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. This decrease largely reflected reduced performance-based compensation, offset by the deleveraging impact associated with the decline in comparable store sales.

Operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 declined 22% to $49.6 million, or 8.6% of net sales, compared to operating income of $63.5 million, or 11.4% of net sales, in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was $31.5 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with net income of $39.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2006.
During the quarter, the Company opened 11 LOFT stores and one Ann Taylor store and closed one LOFT store and two Ann Taylor stores. The total store count at the end of the quarter was 878, comprised of 347 Ann Taylor stores, 474 LOFT stores and 57 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
Total store square footage at the end of the quarter increased 6.7% to 5.1 million square feet versus total square footage of 4.8 million square feet at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Total square footage at the end of the 2007 quarter was 1.9 million for Ann Taylor and 2.8 million for LOFT.
For the full year of fiscal 2007, the Company continues to expect earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25, with expected softness from LOFT in the first half, followed by improved performance for the division in the second half of the year. The primary drivers of the Company's outlook for fiscal 2007 are as follows:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of May 2007.
New York, New York, June 7, 2007
For the four-week period ended June 2, 2007, net sales increased 1.6% to $221.1 million, compared with net sales of $217.6 million for the four-week period ended May 27, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor declined 3.6% to $79.2 million in May 2007, compared with net sales of $82.2 million in May 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales increased 0.8% to $111.8 million in May 2007, compared with net sales of $110.9 million in May 2006.
Comparable store sales for the May 2007 period decreased 4.6%, versus a comparable store sales gain of 12.0% in the May 2006 period. By division, comparable store sales declined 3.2% for Ann Taylor in the 2007 period, compared with an increase of 10.4% the prior year.

Commenting on the Company's sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "As we expected, our sales performance in May improved versus April and, overall, was essentially in line with our expectations. Our Ann Taylor division continued to achieve strong full-price sales, although the division's comp performance for May was impacted by weak mall traffic and continued softness in sweaters that was not offset by our continued strength in knits. Strong categories during the month for Ann Taylor were suits, dresses, knits and petite apparel. At LOFT, we are encouraged by the reaction of our clients to the product improvements we were able to make, including adding some additional color and novelty items to the assortment. We continue to anticipate gradual improvement in LOFT's product assortments over the course of the next several months. Overall, we remain confident in our earnings outlook for the business for the balance of the year, as previously disclosed."

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of June 2007.
New York, New York, July 12, 2007
For the five-week period ended July 7, 2007, net sales decreased 1.4% to $232.4 million, compared with net sales of $235.7 million for the five-week period ended July 1, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor declined 3.6% to $80.6 million in June 2007, compared with net sales of $83.7 million in June 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales decreased 5.4% to $117.7 million in June 2007, compared with net sales of $124.4 million in June 2006.
Comparable store sales for the June 2007 period decreased 8.4%, versus a comparable store sales gain of 12.5% in the June 2006 period. By division, comparable store sales declined 3.3% for Ann Taylor in the 2007 period, compared with an increase of 6.3% the prior year. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales declined 13.9% in June 2007, compared with an increase of 18.5% the prior year.
Commenting on the Company's sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "Our results in June reflected another month of slow traffic, as well as continued softness at LOFT, although client acceptance of new LOFT deliveries has improved. At Ann Taylor, our professional wear-to-work, knit top and dress categories continued to show strength, with color and novelty items particularly strong, while neutrals were challenging. In addition, sweaters continued to be difficult, and we were somewhat more promotional than we had planned at Ann Taylor in order to continue to maintain healthy inventory positions. At LOFT, against the backdrop of an extremely strong June last year, our June delivery this year performed well, and we were pleased with the success of this month's color and novelty offering. However, the overall assortment, which also includes April and May product, continued to lack the appropriate balance of color, novelty, and updated classics. Nevertheless, despite some softness in June and ongoing concerns regarding the macro environment, our focus on aggressively managing our inventory, reducing our cost structure and repurchasing our sharesalong with our ongoing belief that our product at LOFT will be brand-appropriate in the Fallgives us confidence in achieving EPS in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 for the year."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of July 2007.
New York, New York, August 9, 2007
For the four-week period ended August 4, 2007, net sales increased 2.8% to $161.0 million, compared with net sales of $156.7 million for the four-week period ended July 29, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor decreased 2.7% to $57.1 million in July 2007, compared with net sales of $58.7 million in July 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales increased 0.3% to $80.4 million in July 2007, compared with net sales of $80.2 million in July 2006.
Comparable store sales for the July 2007 period decreased 5.0%, versus a comparable store sales gain of 5.1% in the July 2006 period.

For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales declined 9.3% in July 2007, compared with an increase of 8.3% the prior year.
Commenting on the Company's sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "Our results in July were impacted by traffic softness, a highly promotional retail environment, and some remaining product issues at LOFT. We have been very aggressive promotionally to keep our inventories turning, and we believe we are heading into the third quarter in a good position overall. At Ann Taylor, our results for the month reflected some softness from the July store-set, which was too neutral in color but which sold well on initial mark-down. At LOFT, we have effectively managed the business through a tough first half, and we are heading into Fall in a healthy inventory position and with a product assortment that we believe reflects the appropriate balance of color, updated classics and fashion."
Commenting on the Company's outlook, Ms. Krill continued, "We are aggressively managing the business through this period of macro-economic softness and, while we continue to believe that we are positioned for a good Fall season, we are prudently planning our business for an uncertain second half. In this context, we continue to believe we will achieve EPS for the year in the range of $2.15 to $2.25."

faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 2.
Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
. Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 3.
Authorization of Indemnification
. For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise

Good Faith Defined
 
in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any director or officer may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the

Indemnification by a Court
 
director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application.

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified

Section 8.

. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the

Exhibit 99.2
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 ended August 4, 2007. Net sales for the quarter advanced approximately 1% to $614 million, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter totaled $0.50. The Company also reaffirmed its outlook for diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 for the full year of fiscal 2007.
New York, NY, August 24, 2007
Commenting on the results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "The second quarter proved to be challenging for the Company, although I am pleased with how well we have managed through the current macro-economic conditions. While persistent traffic softness and some product-specific issues at both divisions caused us to be promotional during the quarter, our Ann Taylor division was successful in maintaining good margins, and our LOFT division aggressively moved through units to end the quarter in a healthy inventory position. Both divisions are heading into Fall with brand appropriate product assortments and positioned to deliver what we expect to be a good second half. We remain confident in our outlook for the year."
Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 ended August 4, 2007 advanced 0.7% to $614.5 million, compared with net sales of $610.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 ended July 29, 2006. This performance reflected expansion of the Company's store base and continued growth of the Company's Factory and internet businesses, partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales.

By division, net sales at Ann Taylor declined 3.4% to $216.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $224.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. At LOFT, net sales declined 1.8% to $310.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $315.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2006.
Comparable store sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 declined 6.2%, compared with a comparable store sales increase of 10.3% the prior year. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor declined 3.1% in the 2007 quarter, compared with an increase of 6.4% the prior year. The performance at Ann Taylor primarily reflected the impact of sluggish traffic, softness in sweaters and insufficient color in the July store set, partially offset by continued strength in suits, dresses, and knit and woven tops. At LOFT, comparable store sales declined 10.8% in the 2007 quarter, compared with an increase of 14.2% the prior year, continuing to reflect the impact of a product assortment that lacked the appropriate balance of updated classics, color and novelty, which the Company believes has been addressed beginning with the upcoming Fall season. Also impacting LOFT's comparable store sales for the quarter was the soft traffic and the division's highly promotional stance throughout the quarter to keep its inventory turning.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was up 4% versus year-ago, compared with the 17% decline the Company achieved in the prior year.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 3.6 margin points to 50.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. This decline was almost entirely driven by margin softness at LOFT, due to the aforementioned product issues and the resultant aggressive promotional activity throughout the quarter to keep LOFT's inventory turning.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, declined to 42.3% in the second quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 43.0% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2006. This decrease largely reflected reduced performance-based compensation, partially offset by the deleveraging impact associated with the decline in comparable store sales.
Operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 declined 25% to $51.0 million, or 8.3% of net sales, compared to operating income of $68.1 million, or 11.2% of net sales, in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2007 was $31.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared with net income of $43.2 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2006.

The Company indicated that it repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $137 million during the second quarter, completing the $300 million share repurchase program authorized by the Company's Board in March 2007.
During the quarter, the Company opened nine LOFT stores and one Factory store and closed one Ann Taylor store. The total store count at the end of the quarter was 887, comprised of 346 Ann Taylor stores, 483 LOFT stores and 58 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
Total store square footage at the end of the quarter increased approximately 7% to 5.2 million square feet, versus total square footage of 4.8 million square feet at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2006. Total square footage at the end of the 2007 quarter was 1.9 million for Ann Taylor and 2.9 million for LOFT.
Net sales for the first half of fiscal 2007 increased 2.5% to $1,195 million, compared with net sales of $1,166 million in the first half of fiscal 2006. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor declined 1.6% to $439.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $446.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2006. At LOFT, net sales declined 0.8% to $584.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $589.2 million in the first half of fiscal 2006.
Comparable store sales for the first half of fiscal 2007 declined 4.8%, compared to a comparable store sales increase of 8.0% the prior year. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor declined 1.1% in the first half of fiscal 2007, compared with an increase of 6.9% the prior year. At LOFT, comparable store sales declined 10.0% in the first half of fiscal 2007, compared with an increase of 9.7% in the first half of fiscal 2006.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 3.3 margin points to 52.1% in the first half of fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 0.4 percentage points to 43.7% in the first half of fiscal 2007.
Operating income in the first half of fiscal 2007 declined 23% to $100.7 million, or 8.4% of net sales, compared to operating income of $131.6 million, or 11.3% of net sales, in the year-ago period. Net income for the first half of fiscal 2007 was $63.1 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, compared with net income of $82.2 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, for the first half of fiscal 2006.

The Company is planning to launch a new concept in Fall 2008 and recently announced the appointment of Mark Mendelson as President of the new concept. The Company indicated that the concept is targeted at what it calls the modern boomer segment, which it believes is a significantly underserved segment of the apparel market.
Commenting on the new concept, Ms. Krill stated, "We believe that the boomer market we are targeting has been the most significantly underserved and represents a huge opportunity for us. As a Company, we have a distinct heritage in upscale, sophisticated and stylish fashion, along with a proven expertise in incubating and building a new concept. Our approach to satisfying her needs will be unique, and we are on track for an initial launch next Fall."
The Company announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program, enabling the Company to buy back its stock in the open market or in private transactions from time to time. Stated Ms. Krill, "We continue to be focused on returning value to our shareholders, and I am pleased that our Board has authorized a new $300 million share repurchase program."
For the full year of fiscal 2007, the Company continues to expect to deliver earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.15 to $2.25. The primary drivers of the Company's outlook for fiscal 2007 are as follows:

During the Blackout Period and for a period of two years after the Blackout Period has ended, interested parties may obtain, without charge, information regarding the beginning and ending dates of the Blackout Period by contacting Ann Taylor, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 7 Times Square, New York, New York, 10036 (telephone (212) 541-3300).

Commenting on the Company's sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "We were pleased with our overall results for August, which reflected improved trends at both divisions. While traffic continued to be soft, we successfully offset much of this slowdown with strong overall in-store metrics and some planned promotional activity to keep our inventories turning. At Ann Taylor, our August results reflected strength in dresses, casual separates, and knit and woven tops, partially offset by some weakness in sweaters and sportswear. At LOFT, our business strengthened during the month, as clients responded favorably to our August transitional assortment, which featured a more appropriate balance of updated classics, color and novelty. We are entering the Fall season at both divisions in good shape from an inventory standpoint and with product assortments that we believe are more brand-appropriate."
Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 887 stores in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and Online Stores at and as of August 4, 2007.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of September 2007.
New York, New York, October 11, 2007
For the five-week period ended October 6, 2007, net sales increased 6.2% to $246.7 million, compared with net sales of $232.3 million for the five-week period ended September 30, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor decreased 5.1% to $87.6 million in September 2007, compared with net sales of $92.3 million in September 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales increased 11.8% to $123.2 million in September 2007, compared with net sales of $110.2 million in September 2006.
Comparable store sales for the September 2007 period increased 0.5%, versus a comparable store sales gain of 5.8% in the September 2006 period. By division, comparable store sales for Ann Taylor decreased 4.8% in the 2007 period, compared with an increase of 9.6% the prior year. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales increased 2.6% in September 2007, compared with an increase of 1.4% the prior year.
Commenting on the Company's sales, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "Despite persistent traffic softness at both divisions, we managed our business well in September. At Ann Taylor, the slowdown in traffic negatively affected the business, causing us to be more promotional during the month, but we maintained solid margins. At LOFT, we were pleased with our performance in September, which benefited from very strong in-store metrics that offset particularly soft traffic. Clients responded favorably to our more balanced assortment, which was more season-less, featured more color and novelty and offered more relaxed wear-to-work options. We are pleased with the success we achieved during the month in tightly managing our inventory levels, particularly during this period of macroeconomic uncertainty, and we entered October in a healthy position at both divisions."
Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 887 stores in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and Online Stores at and as of August 4, 2007.

99.1     Press Release issued by AnnTaylor Stores Corporation on November 8, 2007.
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of October 2007.
New York, New York, November 8, 2007
For the four-week period ended November 3, 2007, net sales increased 3.7% to $191.6 million, compared with net sales of $184.8 million for the four-week period ended October 28, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor decreased 8.0% to $68.3 million in October 2007, compared with net sales of $74.3 million in October 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales increased 6.2% to $94.4 million in October 2007, compared with net sales of $88.8 million in October 2006.
Comparable store sales for the October 2007 period decreased 4.2%, versus a comparable store sales decline of 0.5% in the October 2006 period. By division, comparable store sales for Ann Taylor decreased 8.5% in the 2007 period, compared with an increase of 1.5% the prior year. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales decreased 2.8% in October 2007, compared with a decrease of 3.4% the prior year. Comparable store sales in the month of October were reduced by timing associated with a promotional program that spanned the months of October and November, causing total Company comps in October to be reduced by approximately 1.3 comp points, with the Ann Taylor division impacted by approximately 2.9 comp points, and the impact at LOFT negligible. Conversely, comps in the month of November will benefit from the timing impact of this program.
The Company indicated that its traffic and comp trends at both divisions have improved in the first few days of fiscal November. Nevertheless, based on the retail market conditions experienced in October  including dramatic traffic softness and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty  the Company is tempering its outlook for the fourth quarter. As a result, the Company is reducing its full-year earnings per share outlook to slightly below its previous guidance range. The Company will be discussing its third quarter results and outlook for the fourth quarter in more detail during its upcoming earnings conference call on November 16
th
.
Commenting on the Company's overall sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "From a top-line perspective, October was a tough month, due to persistent traffic softness and unseasonably warm weather. Nevertheless, we achieved solid margins and strong earnings per share for the quarter, primarily on the strength of our results in August and September and the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program. In addition, we entered the fourth quarter in a healthy inventory position at both divisions. As we head into the holiday season, we are confident in our strategies and our product assortments, although we believe it is prudent to be cautious in this difficult retailing environment and with the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty."

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported its results for the fiscal third quarter and nine months ended November 3, 2007. Net sales for the third quarter advanced approximately 6% to $601 million, and diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 22% to $0.66, the highest quarterly earnings per share in the Company's history.
New York, NY, November 16, 2007
Commenting on the results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "Despite a difficult retail environment for much of the third quarter, we delivered solid margins and record earnings per share, reflecting our heightened focus on tightly managing the business and the ongoing benefit of our share repurchase program. Traffic trends were particularly soft in the month of October and, notwithstanding the improvement we experienced in early November with the onset of colder weather, we have tempered our outlook somewhat for growth in the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, we remain optimistic about the strength of our holiday offerings at both divisions, and we continue to expect to achieve strong EPS growth in the fourth quarter."
Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 ended November 3, 2007 advanced 6.1% to $600.9 million, compared with net sales of $566.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 ended October 28, 2006. This performance reflected expansion of the Company's store base and continued growth of the Company's Factory and internet businesses, partially offset by a modest decline in comparable store sales.
By division, net sales at Ann Taylor declined 4.4% to $213.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $223.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. At LOFT, net sales increased 8.9% to $296.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $272.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006.

Comparable store sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2007 declined 0.4%, compared with a comparable store sales increase of 2.6% the prior year. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor declined 4.4% in the 2007 quarter, compared with an increase of 6.1% the prior year. At LOFT, comparable store sales declined 0.3% in the 2007 quarter, compared with a decline of 0.9% the prior year. Comps at both divisions were significantly impacted by the soft traffic environment and unseasonably warm weather during the quarter.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2007 was down approximately 4%, compared with the 3% decline the Company achieved in the prior year. The Company indicated that both divisions ended the quarter in a healthy inventory position.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, declined 0.5 margin points to 56.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with a gross margin of 56.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. This decline primarily reflected the impact of aggressive promotional activity during the quarter at the Ann Taylor division, in response to the slowdown in traffic and a highly promotional retail environment.
Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, improved 0.7 margin points to 45.0% in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 45.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. This improvement primarily reflected lower performance-based compensation expense and reduced long-term benefit costs associated with modification during the quarter of certain long-term benefit plans. Partially offsetting these positive factors was the impact of deleveraging in the quarter.
Operating income increased 7.9% to $66.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to operating income of $61.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Operating margin, as a percentage of net sales, advanced to 11.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared to 10.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2006.
Net income grew 3.8% to $40.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with net income of $39.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2006. Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2007 advanced 22.2% to a record $0.66, compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.54 the prior year.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately $15 million. Year-to-date shares repurchased through the third quarter of fiscal 2007 totaled approximately 8.4 million, at a total cost of approximately $315 million.

During the quarter, the Company opened nine Ann Taylor stores, 20 Ann Taylor LOFT stores, and nine Ann Taylor Factory stores, and closed one Ann Taylor store and three Ann Taylor LOFT stores. During the quarter, the Company opened its 500
th
LOFT store, just nine years since the opening of first LOFT store. At the end of the quarter, total store count was 921 stores, comprised of 354 Ann Taylor stores, 500 LOFT stores and 67 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
Total store square footage at the end of the quarter increased approximately 7.6% to 5.4 million square feet, versus total square footage of 5.0 million square feet at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of November 2007.
New York, New York, December 6, 2007
For the four-week period ended December 1, 2007, net sales increased 12.2% to $209.2 million, compared with net sales of $186.4 million for the four-week period ended November 25, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor increased 1.4% to $74.3 million in November 2007, compared with net sales of $73.3 million in November 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales increased 15.5% to $99.6 million in November 2007, compared with net sales of $86.2 million in November 2006.
Comparable store sales for the November 2007 period increased 3.9%, versus a comparable store sales decline of 4.3% in the November 2006 period. By division, comparable store sales for Ann Taylor increased 0.6% in the 2007 period, compared with a decrease of 3.4% the prior year. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales increased 5.3% in November 2007, compared with a decrease of 7.7% the prior year. As disclosed last month, comparable store sales in the month of November benefited from timing associated with a promotional program that began in October, resulting in a November benefit of 1.2 points to total Company comps and 3.0 points to Ann Taylor division comps.
Commenting on the Company's overall sales results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "From a sales and margin perspective, November was a solid month overall for us. Our trends in the first half of the month were better than in the back half, due to traffic weakness as the month progressed. The Ann Taylor division experienced very soft traffic in the second half of the month, although we achieved good in-store metrics. At LOFT, traffic in the back half was also soft, but the division effectively offset this softness with very strong in-store performance. Importantly, we are entering December with healthy inventory positions at both divisions and with product assortments that we believe are better than last year."

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of December 2007. In making the announcement, the Company also updated its outlook for the full fiscal year.
New York, New York, January 10, 2008
For the five-week period ended January 5, 2008, net sales decreased 3.8% to $263.7 million, compared with net sales of $274.2 million for the five-week period ended December 30, 2006. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor decreased 13.1% to $94.8 million in December 2007, compared with net sales of $109.1 million in December 2006. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales increased 0.5% to $131.5 million in December 2007, compared with net sales of $130.9 million in December 2006.
Comparable store sales for the December 2007 period decreased 9.4%, versus a comparable store sales decline of 5.3% in the December 2006 period. By division, comparable store sales for Ann Taylor decreased 13.9% in the 2007 period, compared with a decrease of 4.2% the prior year. For Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales decreased 7.0% in December 2007, compared with a decrease of 8.1% the prior year. Due to the impact that the fiscal calendar shift had on the month of December, the Company provided the additional perspective that December comparable store sales at both divisions were unfavorably impacted by approximately seven comp points.
The Company indicated that, based on year-to-date business results through the month of December and its current outlook for January, it now expects diluted earnings per share for the full year of fiscal 2007 to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.85.
Commenting on the results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "December was a disappointing month, as double-digit traffic declines at both divisions and a highly promotional retail environment depressed both sales and margins for the Company. At the Ann Taylor division, in response to the weak traffic and soft in-store metrics, we stepped up our promotional activity to maintain a healthy inventory position, which negatively impacted margin. At LOFT, traffic was also very weak and, despite positive client reaction to our assortments and continued solid in-store metrics, we responded with increased promotional activity to keep our inventory turning. As a result, LOFT's margin performance, while improved significantly versus the prior year, fell short of our expectations. We continue to manage the business very tightly to minimize the impact of the ongoing macroeconomic softness, and we plan to enter fiscal 2008 in a healthy inventory position."

On January 30, 2008, AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (the "Company") announced a multi-year restructuring program designed to enhance profitability and improve overall effectiveness. The restructuring program, the result of a comprehensive review of the Company's cost structure, is expected to be completed in fiscal 2010 and includes closing 117 underperforming stores, reducing the Company's corporate staff by approximately 13% and undertaking a broad-based productivity initiative that includes, among other things, the strategic procurement of non-merchandise goods and services. The Company also announced that, in light of ongoing macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty in the retail sector, it is taking a conservative approach to new store growth in fiscal 2008.
Based on a review of its store portfolio and assessment of individual store productivity, the Company identified 117 underperforming stores. The Company will adopt a staged approach to closing these stores over the fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2010 period. As such, the Company plans to close 64 stores during fiscal 2008, with the balance to be closed in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010.
The Company also plans to eliminate 180 corporate positions through an organizational streamlining designed to increase span of control and improve operating efficiency and effectiveness. In addition, as part of a broad-based productivity initiative, the Company plans to consolidate all non-merchandise purchasing activities under a centralized strategic procurement organization, outsource various activities where cost efficiencies can be achieved and optimize store productivity and effectiveness.
The Company expects pre-tax expenses associated with the restructuring program to total approximately $40 to $45 million, with approximately $25 million related to store-level fixed asset and inventory impairment, approximately $10 million in severance and related costs, and the balance related to various other costs to implement the program. Of these pre-tax expenses, approximately $29 million (related to the non-cash write-down of assets, severance and other costs) are expected to be incurred in fiscal 2007. Costs expected to be incurred in fiscal 2008 total approximately $7 to $10 million and are largely cash expenditures. The balance of the program costs, also primarily cash expenditures, is expected to be incurred during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010.
The above estimated costs and charges are preliminary and may vary materially based on various factors, including timing in execution of the restructuring program and changes in management's assumptions and projections.
 
The information set forth in Item 2.05 is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.06.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced a multi-year restructuring program that is designed to enhance profitability and improve overall effectiveness, following the Company's comprehensive review of its SG&A cost structure. The Company also announced that, in light of the ongoing macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty in the retail sector, it is taking a conservative approach to new store growth in fiscal 2008.
New York, NY, January 30, 2008
The key elements of the restructuring program include:
 
 
 
Commenting on the announcement, Ann Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "Following a very thorough review of our entire business and cost structure, we are taking actions to enhance our overall effectiveness and improve our profitability, and we believe that doing so will increase our operating margin by more than 200 basis points over the next three years. This restructuring is designed to position us as a stronger, leaner Company that can be more agile in responding to economic realities and marketplace opportunities, and we are confident that this program will not only improve our bottom line, but also enable us to reinvest in our business to drive more profitable growth in the future. I firmly believe we are better positioned today to successfully execute a program of this nature than at any time in our history."

"For 2008, in light of the current macro environment and retail slowdown, we are taking a very measured approach to capital spending for new store growth, including opening fewer Ann Taylor and LOFT stores and delaying the test of our new concept until 2009. At the same time, we are planning to aggressively invest in factory channel expansion. We believe that this approach mitigates business and financial risk during this period of economic uncertainty and, in concert with the restructuring program, positions the Company to accelerate our growth plans as the economy and consumer spending improve," Ms Krill stated.
The restructuring program is expected to result in ongoing annualized pre-tax savings of approximately $50 million by fiscal 2010, with the benefit to fiscal 2008 expected to total approximately $20-25 million. The total pre-tax cost to implement the program is expected to be approximately $40-45 million, with $29 million, or approximately $0.29 per diluted share, to be incurred in fiscal 2007. Excluding these expenses, the Company indicated that it remains comfortable with its previous outlook for diluted EPS of $1.80-$1.85 for fiscal 2007.
The Company indicated that approximately $40 million of the expected $50 million in ongoing annualized savings are cash savings, primarily stemming from the strategic procurement of non-merchandise goods and services, the reduced corporate headcount and other productivity initiatives.
The anticipated total program cost of $40-45 million includes approximately $25 million in non-cash expenses, primarily associated with the write-down of assets related to store closures. The balance of approximately $15-20 million in expenses are cash charges and relate primarily to severance and various other costs to implement the restructuring.
Commenting on the program, Ms. Krill stated, "On a cash basis, this restructuring program is expected to yield the Company approximately $40 million in ongoing annualized savings, at a cost of approximately $15-20 million. This expected return is very compelling, and we believe the program delivers real value to our shareholders and positions us for success in the years ahead."
The Company indicated that the fiscal 2007 costs of $29 million primarily reflect the non-cash write-down of assets, as well as severance and other expenses. Program costs expected to be incurred in fiscal 2008 total approximately $7-10 million and are largely cash expenses. The balance of the program costs, to be incurred over the 2009-2010 period, total approximately $4-6 million and are largely cash charges.
The component of the restructuring involves the closure of 117 underperforming stores and the related non-cash write-off of assets associated with this decision. The Company plans to close 64 of the 117 stores during fiscal 2008, with the balance to be closed over the fiscal 2009-2010 period. The Company conducted a careful review of options with respect to the method and timing of closing the

underperforming stores and determined that the staged approach over the 2008-2010 period was the most cost-effective option. The sales contribution in fiscal 2007 of the 117 stores slated for closure is estimated at approximately $210 million, with minimal operating income impact.
By division, the Company is planning to close 25 Ann Taylor stores in fiscal 2008, with an additional 14 stores slated for closure in fiscal 2009-2010. For LOFT, 39 stores are expected to be closed in fiscal 2008, with 39 additional stores slated for closure in fiscal 2009-2010. The Company indicated that, in addition to the restructuring program, it expects to continue to close stores over the 2009-2010 period, as part of its normal business process.
The involves the elimination of 180 positions, or 13% of the Company's corporate workforce, and is designed to increase span of control and improve efficiency and effectiveness.
organizational streamlining
The involves the strategic procurement of non-merchandise goods and services in all areas of the Company's SG&A cost structure. These efforts involve the internal consolidation of all purchasing activities under a centralized strategic procurement organization to leverage scale, as well as the outsourcing of various activities where cost efficiencies can be achieved without sacrificing quality. In addition, this initiative involves the optimization of all aspects of store productivity and effectiveness.
broad-based productivity initiative
The Company also indicated that, for fiscal 2008, it has conservatively planned its core business performance, particularly in the first half, due to the anticipation of continued weakness in the economy and consumer spending. The Company continues to believe that it will enter fiscal 2008 in a healthy inventory position and will be focused throughout the year on keeping its inventories under control.
In terms of new store openings for fiscal 2008, the Company currently plans to open four Ann Taylor stores, 15 LOFT stores and 20-25 Ann Taylor Factory stores. In addition, the Company is proceeding with its rollout of LOFT Outlet and plans to open 10 LOFT Outlet stores in fiscal 2008.
"We continue to believe that our Company has tremendous untapped growth potential in all of our retail concepts as well as our Internet channel. We also remain very optimistic about our new concept and the consumer it will ultimately serve. However, for 2008, we are focusing our resources on implementing our restructuring program and ensuring our core businesses are strong, healthy and more profitable. In all, the plans we are pursuing are designed to enable us to weather the expected downturn in 2008, while positioning the Company for aggressively pursuing growth as the economy recovers," stated Ms. Krill.

Exhibit 99.1
:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of January 2008 and the full fiscal year 2007. The Company noted that fiscal 2007 represented a 52-week period, while fiscal 2006 represented a 53-week period. As a result, the fiscal 2007 month of January included one less week of sales than did the fiscal 2006 month of January.
New York, New York, February 7, 2008
Including this impact, net sales for the four-week period ended February 2, 2008 decreased 14.7% to $127.9 million, compared with net sales of $149.9 million for the five-week period ended February 3, 2007, which included approximately $31 million in net sales from the extra week. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor decreased 26.6% to $44.8 million in January 2008, compared with net sales of $61.0 million in January 2007. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales decreased 8.1% to $62.2 million in January 2008, compared with net sales of $67.7 million in January 2007.
Comparable store sales for the four-week period ended February 2, 2008 were even with the four-week period ending January 27, 2007. By division, comparable store sales for Ann Taylor decreased 6.5% in January 2008, and for Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales increased 5.9% in January 2008.
Commenting on the announcement, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "As we expected, our results in January continued to be impacted by the macroeconomic slowdown as well as continued soft traffic trends at both divisions. To keep our inventories turning, we were promotionally aggressive during the month, and we are entering fiscal 2008 in a healthy inventory position. As we look ahead, our focus will continue to be on elevating our product offering at both divisions, as well as executing our recently-announced restructuring program. We believe we are positioning ourselves prudently to weather this period of softness and uncertainty and will remain focused throughout the upcoming year on managing the things within our control and mitigating business risk wherever possible."
For the 52-week period ended February 2, 2008, net sales increased 2.3% to $2,396.5 million, compared with net sales of $2,342.9 million for the 53-week period ended February 3, 2007.

Due to market concerns regarding "Auction Rate Securities" generally, the Company is updating information related to its short-term investments in Auction Rate Securities. As of February 25, 2008, the Company had approximately $6 million invested in Auction Rate Securities. This compares to the $24 million in Auction Rate Securities previously noted in the Company's most recent SEC 10-Q filing, and reflects the Company's ability to effectively reduce its investment position in Auction Rate Securities since the end of the fiscal third quarter. The $6 million in Auction Rate Securities in which the Company is currently invested are rated AAA by Standard & Poor's.
The Company believes that its current holdings of Auction Rate Securities will not result in any material write down of value of these securities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced its sales results for the month of February 2008.
New York, New York, March 6, 2008
For the four-week period ended March 1, 2008, net sales increased 3.9% to $141.4 million, compared with net sales of $136.1 million for the four-week period ended March 3, 2007. By division, net sales for Ann Taylor totaled $50.0 million in February 2008, compared with net sales of $54.6 million in February 2007. For Ann Taylor LOFT, net sales totaled $66.9 million in February 2008, compared with net sales of $60.8 million in February 2007.
Comparable store sales for the four-week period ended March 1, 2008 decreased 1.7%. By division, comparable store sales for Ann Taylor decreased 8.7%, while at Ann Taylor LOFT, comparable store sales increased 2.8%.
Commenting on the announcement, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "As we expected, our results in the month of February reflected continued soft traffic trends in our business, albeit improved versus last month. At Ann Taylor, we were highly promotional during the month to keep our inventory turning and to move through the less-compelling January and February store sets. At LOFT, well-received product assortments and very strong in-store metrics more than offset the impact of the weak traffic environment. Importantly, we ended the month with inventories at both divisions in good shape."
Ann Taylor is one of the country's leading women's specialty retailers, operating 921 stores in 46 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and also Online Stores at and as of November 3, 2007.

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated March 14, 2008. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported its results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2007 ended February 2, 2008. For the full year of fiscal 2007, diluted earnings per share, on a GAAP basis, were $1.53, including $0.31 in one-time restructuring costs. Excluding one-time restructuring costs, diluted earnings per share for the full year were $1.84, compared with $1.98 in fiscal 2006.
New York, NY, March 14, 2008
On January 30, 2008, the Company announced a multi-year, strategic restructuring program, expected to deliver $50 million in ongoing annualized pre-tax savings by fiscal 2010. Key elements of the program include the optimization of the Company's store portfolio, including the closure of 117 underperforming stores over the 2008-2010 period; an organizational streamlining, primarily involving the downsizing of the Company's headquarters staff by approximately 13%, which was completed in January 2008; and a broad-based productivity initiative, including the strategic procurement of non-merchandise goods and services. Total pre-tax costs associated with the implementation of the program are expected to be approximately $40-45 million over the three-year period. The Company expects this program to dramatically improve its efficiency, effectiveness and profitability over the next three years and beyond.
Commenting on the results of the year, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "Following a record year in fiscal 2006, this past year proved to be more difficult, given the soft macroeconomic environment and resultant impact on the retail sector and our Company. Importantly, we managed our inventory levels and in-store metrics very well all year, and we are entering fiscal 2008 in excellent shape, in this regard. Thus, while we expect fiscal 2008 to be challengingparticularly in the first halfwe are confident that the actions we are taking, including evolving our brands to ensure they remain compelling and exciting, scaling back new store growth, implementing our restructuring program to reduce our cost structure, aggressively expanding our Ann Taylor Factory business and launching our new LOFT Outlet concept, will position the Company prudently in this uncertain environment. We believe we are well positioned for growth and success, as the economy improves."
The Company indicated that, due to the timing of its fiscal calendar, the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2007 included one less week than the comparable periods in fiscal 2006. The extra week of sales in fiscal 2006 benefited the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2006 by approximately $31 million. The Company further indicated that its comparable store sales results are reported on an equivalent-week basis.

Net sales for the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were $600.8 million, compared with net sales of $610.5 million in the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. Excluding the extra week in fiscal 2006, net sales increased approximately 3.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.
By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $214.0 million in the 13-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $243.4 million in the 14-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. On the same basis, net sales at LOFT were $293.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $284.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The extra week in fiscal 2006 benefited Ann Taylor sales by $13.4 million and LOFT sales by $13.3 million. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2006, net sales at Ann Taylor declined approximately 7.0% and net sales at LOFT increased approximately 8.0%.
Comparable store sales for the quarter declined 3.2% versus the prior year. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor declined 7.8%, reflecting a double-digit decline in traffic that was only partially offset by solid in-store metrics, as Ann Taylor's assortments lacked the "newness" that clients are increasingly seeking. At LOFT, comparable store sales declined 0.5%, also reflecting a double-digit decline in traffic, which was almost entirely offset by strong in-store metrics and positive client response to the division's product assortments.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased 1.1 margin points to 48.7% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, compared with a gross margin of 47.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The increase in gross margin was entirely driven by strength at LOFT, due to positive client response to the division's product offering versus last year, partially offset by weakness at Ann Taylor.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 were $274.2 million, or 45.6% of net sales, compared to $260.0 million, or 42.6% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily reflected the benefit in 2006 related to the extra week of sales, as well as the impact of deleveraging in the 2007 period, due to lower comparable store sales.
During the quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $30.1 million, comprised of a $25.2 million non-cash write-down of assets associated with planned store closures, and $4.9 million in cash charges primarily related to severance associated with the Company's organizational streamlining. On an after-tax basis, the restructuring program impact in the fourth quarter of 2007 was $18.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share.

Excluding the aforementioned restructuring charge, operating income in the quarter was $18.2 million, compared with operating income of $30.5 million in fiscal 2006.
The Company reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, on a GAAP basis, of $6.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, including the impact of the restructuring charge. Excluding the restructuring charge, net income in the quarter was $11.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with net income of $21.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2006.
During the quarter, the company opened four Ann Taylor stores, 12 LOFT stores and one Ann Taylor Factory store, and closed nine Ann Taylor stores. The total store count at the end of the quarter was 929, comprised of 349 Ann Taylor stores, 512 LOFT stores and 68 Ann Taylor Factory stores.
During the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 0.9 million shares of its common stock at an approximate cost of $26 million.
Net sales for the 52-week full year of fiscal 2007 advanced to $2.4 billion, compared with net sales of $2.3 billion for the 53-week full year of fiscal 2006. Excluding the extra week in fiscal 2006, net sales increased approximately 3.7% in fiscal 2007.
By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $866.6 million in the 52-week fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $912.8 million for the 53 weeks of fiscal 2006. On the same basis, net sales at LOFT were $1,174.4 million in fiscal 2007, compared with net sales of $1,146.5 million in fiscal 2006. The extra week in fiscal 2006 benefited Ann Taylor sales by $13.4 million and LOFT sales by $13.3 million. Excluding the extra week in fiscal 2006, net sales at Ann Taylor declined approximately 3.6%, and net sales at LOFT increased approximately 3.6%.
Comparable store sales for the year decreased 3.3% versus the prior year. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor decreased 3.7% in fiscal 2007 and, at LOFT, comparable store sales decreased 5.4% in fiscal 2007. The decline for the year at LOFT was entirely due to significant softness experienced in the first half of the year.
Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 1.5 margin points to 52.2% in fiscal 2007, versus 53.7% in fiscal 2006. This decline was due to lower margins at both Ann Taylor and LOFT for the year, partially offset by strength at Factory. The Company noted that LOFT's margins were particularly soft in the first half of fiscal 2007 but fully recovered and were significantly above year-ago in the second half of the year.

Total inventory on a per square foot basis at the end of fiscal 2007 was up 1%, due to timing of inventory in transit, stemming primarily from the earlier timing of Easter in fiscal 2008. Total in-store inventory on a per square foot basis was down 16% at year-end. By division, inventory on a per square foot basis at Ann Taylor, excluding Beauty, increased 4%, reflecting higher in-transit inventory, partially offset by a 7% decline in in-store inventory. At LOFT, year-end inventory on a per square foot basis decreased 7%, reflecting a 34% decline in in-store inventory, partially offset by higher in-transit inventory.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2007 were $1,063.6 million, or 44.4% of net sales, compared to $1,033.2 million, or 44.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2006. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was largely due to the benefit in 2006 related to the extra week of sales, as well as the impact of deleveraging in the 2007 period. Partially offsetting these factors was lower performance-based compensation costs.
The Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling approximately $32.3 million in fiscal 2007, comprised of a $25.2 million non-cash write-down of assets associated with store closings and $7.1 million in severance and other cash expenses related to implementing the program. On an after-tax basis, the restructuring program impact for the full year fiscal 2007 was approximately $19.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share.
Excluding the aforementioned restructuring charges, operating income in fiscal 2007 was $187.6 million, compared to operating income of $223.8 million in fiscal 2006. On the same basis, net income in fiscal 2007 was $116.7 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared with net income of $143.0 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in fiscal 2006.
During fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 9.3 million shares of its common stock a total cost of $340 million.
The Company opened a total of 77 new stores and closed a total of 17 stores, during fiscal 2007, ending the year at a total store count of 929 stores. Ann Taylor opened 14 new stores during the year and closed 13 older ones, while LOFT opened 52 new stores and closed four, and Factory opened 11 new stores.
Total Company store square footage for fiscal 2007 increased approximately 7% to 5.4 million square feet, versus 5.1 million square feet at fiscal year-end 2006. By division, total square footage at the end of fiscal 2007 was 1.9 million for Ann Taylor and 3.0 million for LOFT. As part of the Company's restructuring program, the 117 underperforming stores slated for closure over the fiscal 2008-2010 period are comprised of 39 Ann Taylor stores and 78 LOFT stores. The Company indicated that its outlook for store potential of each of its businesses remains unchanged.

The Company has planned its business conservatively for 2008, based on ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and current weak traffic trends in the business. In this context, the Company expects earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2008, excluding one-time restructuring costs, to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.90.
The Company indicated that, given the current environment and potential volatility in performance based on factors outside of its control, it has decided to provide earnings guidance for the next few quarters on a quarter-by-quarter basis. At the same time, the Company noted that, effective immediately, it will discontinue reporting sales on a monthly basis, but will continue to report sales and earnings on a quarterly basis.
The Company expects the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to be the most challenging of the year, from a sales and margin perspective. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter, excluding one-time restructuring costs, are expected to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.40. The Company expects its performance to improve in the second quarter and throughout the year.
The primary drivers of the Company's full-year outlook are provided below.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In support of the Company's outlook for fiscal 2008, it plans to open approximately four Ann Taylor stores, 15 LOFT stores, 20-25 Ann Taylor Factory Stores and 10 Loft Outlet stores.

On March 12, 2008, the Compensation Committee established divisional and/or corporate operating profit performance goals for fiscal year 2008 under the Company's Management Performance Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). The Compensation Committee also decided that it would not set a new cycle for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 or future cycles under the Company's 2004 Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan. In connection with that decision, the Committee adopted a new long-term feature under the Plan, whereby the Company's executive officers would receive an additional award under the Plan based on the Company's achievement of the corporate operating profit goal for the award year (the "Deferred Award") that would not be payable until the expiration of a three-year deferral period. The amount of the Deferred Award would increase or decrease based on the Company's average corporate net income performance over that three-year period, and the executive officer's incentive target under the Deferred Award would be a percentage of his/her base salary ranging from 50% to 100%, depending on corporate title and responsibilities.

On April 23, 2008, certain subsidiaries of the Company (the "Borrowers") increased and renegotiated on more favorable terms their existing senior secured revolving credit facility (the "New Facility") in a transaction that was oversubscribed. The New Facility replaces and renews the prior facility and expands the liquidity of the facility from $175.0 to $250.0 million, which the Borrowers may elect to increase by up to an additional $100.0 million, subject to obtaining commitments totaling such requested increase amount. The Company does not currently anticipate borrowing against the New Facility to fund working capital needs of the business.
The obligations of the Borrowers under the New Facility are guaranteed by AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (the "Company"). The New Facility is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all presently owned and hereafter-acquired real and personal property of the Borrowers and the Company, excluding leasehold interests and certain other property.
Bank of America, N.A. is the Administrative and Collateral Agent for the lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wachovia Bank, National Association, and RBS Citizens, N.A. are Syndication Agents. The New Facility was syndicated with a total of 6 banks participating. It will primarily be used for working capital, letters of credit and other corporate purposes. Borrowings under the New Facility will bear interest at the Base Rate or the LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin (as such terms are defined in the New Facility). The New Facility also contains representations, warranties, covenants, and other terms and conditions that are customary for an agreement of this nature and that are generally consistent with the prior facility.
The above description of the New Facility is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the New Facility, a copy of which is attached to this report as Exhibit 10.1.
 
The disclosure required by this item is included in "Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement," which is incorporated by reference.

The Agent is under no duty, however, to visit or observe any Real Property owned by any Borrower that is part of the Collateral or to conduct tests, and any such acts by the Agent will be solely for the purposes of protecting the Agent's Liens and preserving the Agent and the Lenders' rights under the Loan Documents. No site visit, observation or testing by the Agent and the Lenders will result in a waiver of any default of any Borrower or impose any liability on the Agent or the Lenders. In no event will any site visit, observation or testing by the Agent be a representation that hazardous substances are or are not present in, on or under such Real Property, or that there has been or will be compliance with any Environmental Law.

Agent and the Lenders owe no duty of care to protect the Borrowers, any other Credit Party or any other party against, or to inform the Borrowers, any other Credit Party or any other party of, any hazardous substances or any other adverse condition affecting any Real Property owned by any Borrower that is part of the Collateral. The Agent may in its discretion disclose to the Borrowers or to any other party if so required by any Requirement of Law any report or findings made as a result of, or in connection with, any site visit, observation or testing by the Agent. Each Borrower understands and agrees that the Agent makes no warranty or representation to the Borrowers or any other party regarding the truth, accuracy or completeness of any such report or findings that may be disclosed. Each Borrower also understands that depending on the results of any site visit, observation or testing by the Agent and disclosed to the Borrowers, the Borrowers, the Parent, or its Subsidiaries may have a legal obligation to notify one or more environmental agencies of the results, that such reporting requirements are site-specific, and are to be evaluated by the applicable Borrower without advice or assistance from the Agent. In each instance, the Agent will give the applicable Borrower reasonable notice before entering such Real Property. The Agent will make reasonable efforts to avoid interfering with such Borrower's or any other Credit Party's use of such Real Property or any other property in exercising any rights provided hereunder.

During the period between Settlement Dates, the Bank with respect to Non-Ratable Loans, the Agent with respect to Agent Advances, and each Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances, shall be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the actual average daily amount of funds employed by the Bank, the Agent and the other Lenders.
(vi) Unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender to the contrary, the Agent may assume that the applicable conditions precedent set forth in have been satisfied and the requested Borrowing will not exceed Availability on any Funding Date for a Revolving Loan or Non-Ratable Loan.
Article 8
 
(b) . All Revolving Loans (other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances) shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, and (iii) the obligations of each Lender hereunder shall be several, not joint and several.
Lenders' Failure to Perform
(c) . Unless the Agent receives notice from a Lender on or prior to the Effective Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the Effective Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available as and when required hereunder to the Agent that Lender's Pro Rata Share of a Borrowing, the Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date. Furthermore, the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If any Lender has not transferred, on the date required hereunder, its full Pro Rata Share of any required funding to the Agent in immediately available funds and the Agent has transferred the corresponding amount to a Borrower, such Lender, on the Business Day following such date, shall make such amount available to the Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for that day. A notice by the Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to amounts owing shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If a Lender's full Pro Rata Share is transferred to the Agent as required, the amount transferred to the Agent shall constitute that Lender's Revolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. If that amount is not transferred to the Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, the Agent will notify the applicable Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Agent, such Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent for the Agent's account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans comprising that particular Borrowing. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan on any Funding Date (any such Lender, prior to the cure of such failure, being hereinafter referred to as a "") shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make a Revolving Loan on that Funding Date. No Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's failure to advance such other Lenders' Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing.
Defaulting Lenders
Defaulting Lender
(d) . The Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a Defaulting Lender any payments made by any Borrower to the Agent for the Defaulting Lender's benefit; nor shall a Defaulting Lender be entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder. Amounts payable to a Defaulting Lender shall instead be paid to or retained by the Agent. In its discretion, the Agent may loan any Borrower the amount of all such payments received or retained by it for the account of such Defaulting Lender. Any amounts so loaned to any Borrower shall bear interest at the rate applicable to Base Rate Loans and for all other purposes of this Agreement shall be treated as if they were Revolving Loans, provided,
Retention of Defaulting Lender's Payments
 
however, that for purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents and determining Pro Rata Shares, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a "Lender". Until a Defaulting Lender cures its failure to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Borrowing (A) such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to any portion of the Unused Line Fee and (B) the Unused Line Fee shall accrue in favor of the Lenders which have funded their respective Pro Rata Shares of such requested Borrowing and shall be allocated among such performing Lenders ratably based upon their relative Commitments. This Section shall remain effective with respect to such Lender until such time as the Defaulting Lender shall no longer be in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement. The terms of this Section shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, or relieve or excuse the performance by any Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder.

(e)
(ii) . Whenever the Agent receives a payment from a Borrower on account of reimbursement obligations in respect of a Letter of Credit or L/C Borrowing as to which the Agent has previously received for the account of a Letter of Credit Issuer thereof payment from a Lender, the Agent shall promptly pay to such Lender such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such payment from such Borrower. Each such payment shall be made by the Agent on the next Settlement Date.
Sharing of Reimbursement Obligation Payments
(iii) . Upon the request of any Lender, the Agent shall, to the extent delivered to the Agent by the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer, furnish to such Lender copies of any Letter of Credit, reimbursement agreements executed in connection therewith, applications for any Letter of Credit, and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Lender.

(3) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

(5) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default; or
(6) the failure of such Borrower to satisfy the applicable conditions precedent set forth in .
Article 8
(c) . In the event any payment by or on behalf of a Borrower received by the Agent with respect to any Letter of Credit or L/C Borrowing and distributed by the Agent to the Lenders on account of their respective participations therein is thereafter set aside, avoided or recovered from the Agent in connection with any receivership, liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, the Lenders shall, upon demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent their respective Pro Rata Shares of such amount set aside, avoided or recovered, together with interest at the rate required to be paid by the Agent upon the amount required to be repaid by it. Unless the Agent receives notice from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that such Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption,

distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.

Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse each Letter of Credit Issuer promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata Share of any costs or expenses payable by any Borrower to such Letter of Credit Issuer, to the extent that any Letter of Credit Issuer is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by such Borrower.

Upon the request of Agent, each Grantor shall so notify Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on Collateral.

.

19.
REMEDIES; RIGHTS UPON DEFAULT
(a) In addition to all other rights and remedies granted to it under this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and under any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to any of the Obligations, if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Agent may exercise all rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Grantor expressly agrees that in any such event Agent, without demand of performance or other demand, advertisement or notice of any kind (except the notice specified below of time and place of public or private sale) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person (all and each of which demands, advertisements and notices are hereby expressly waived to the maximum extent permitted by the UCC and other applicable law), may forthwith enter upon the premises of such Grantor where any Collateral is located through self-help, without judicial process, without first obtaining a final judgment or giving such Grantor or any other Person notice and opportunity for a hearing on Agent's claim or action and may collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof, and may forthwith sell, lease, license, assign, give an option or options to purchase, or sell or otherwise dispose of and deliver said Collateral (or contract to do so), or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at a public or private sale or sales, at any exchange at such prices as it may deem acceptable, for cash or on credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. Agent or any Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase for the benefit of Agent and Lenders, the whole or any part of said Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption, which equity of redemption such Grantor hereby releases. Such sales may be adjourned and continued from time to time with or without notice. Agent shall have the right to conduct such sales on any Grantor's premises or elsewhere and shall have the right to use any Grantor's premises without charge for such time or times as Agent deems necessary or advisable. The Agent is authorized, at any such sale, if it
 
deems it advisable so to do, to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers of any of the Pledged Collateral to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or sale of any such Pledged Collateral, and to take such other actions as it may deem appropriate to exempt the offer and sale of the Collateral from any registration requirements of state or federal securities laws (including, if it deems it appropriate, actions to comply with Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to time amended (the "Securities Act")).
(b) Each Grantor further agrees, at Agent's request, to assemble the Collateral and make it available to Agent at a place or places designated by Agent which are reasonably convenient to Agent and such Grantor, whether at such Grantor's premises or elsewhere. Until Agent is able to effect a sale, lease, or other disposition of Collateral, Agent shall have the right to hold or use Collateral, or any part thereof, to the extent that it deems appropriate for the purpose of preserving Collateral or its value or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by Agent. Agent shall have no obligation to any Grantor to maintain or preserve the rights of such Grantor as against third parties with respect to Collateral while Collateral is in the possession of Agent. Agent may, if it so elects, seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to take possession of Collateral and to enforce any of Agent's remedies (for the benefit of Agent and Lenders), with respect to such appointment without prior notice or hearing as to such appointment. Agent shall apply the net proceeds of any such collection, recovery, receipt, appropriation, realization or sale to the Obligations as provided in the Credit Agreement, and only after so paying over such net proceeds, and after the payment by Agent of any other amount required by any provision of law, need Agent account for the surplus, if any, to such Grantor. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all claims, damages, and demands against Agent or any Lender arising out of the repossession, retention or sale of the Collateral except such as arise out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or such Lender as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Each Grantor agrees that ten (10) days prior notice by Agent of the time and place of any public sale or of the time after which a private sale may take place is reasonable notification of such matters. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are insufficient to pay all Obligations, including any attorneys' fees or other expenses incurred by Agent or any Lender to collect such deficiency.
(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each Grantor hereby waives presentment, demand, protest or any notice (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) of any kind in connection with this Agreement or any Collateral.
(d) To the extent that applicable law imposes duties on the Agent to exercise remedies in a commercially reasonable manner, each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that it is commercially reasonable for the Agent (a) to fail to incur expenses reasonably deemed significant by the Agent to prepare Collateral for disposition or otherwise to complete raw material or work in process into finished goods or other finished products for disposition, (b) to fail to obtain third party consents for access to Collateral to be disposed of, or to obtain or, if not required by other law, to fail to obtain governmental or third party consents for the collection or disposition of Collateral to be collected or disposed of, (c) to fail to exercise collection remedies
 
against Account Debtors or other Persons obligated on Collateral or to remove Liens on or any adverse claims against Collateral, (d) to exercise collection remedies against Account Debtors and other Persons obligated on Collateral directly or through the use of collection agencies and other collection specialists, (e) to advertise dispositions of Collateral through publications or media of general circulation, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (f) to contact other Persons, whether or not in the same business as such Grantor, for expressions of interest in acquiring all or any portion of such Collateral, (g) to hire one or more professional auctioneers to assist in the disposition of Collateral, whether or not the Collateral is of a specialized nature, (h) to dispose of Collateral by utilizing internet sites that provide for the auction of assets of the types included in the Collateral or that have the reasonable capacity of doing so, or that match buyers and sellers of assets, (i) to dispose of assets in wholesale rather than retail markets, (j) to disclaim disposition warranties, such as title, possession or quiet enjoyment, (k) to purchase insurance or credit enhancements to insure the Agent against risks of loss, collection or disposition of Collateral or to provide to the Agent a guaranteed return from the collection or disposition of Collateral, or (l) to the extent deemed appropriate by the Agent, to obtain the services of other brokers, investment bankers, consultants and other professionals to assist the Agent in the collection or disposition of any of the Collateral. Each Grantor acknowledges that the purpose of this ) is to provide non-exhaustive indications of what actions or omissions by the Agent would not be commercially unreasonable in the Agent's exercise of remedies against the Collateral and that other actions or omissions by the Agent shall not be deemed commercially unreasonable solely on account of not being indicated in this ). Without limitation upon the foregoing, nothing contained in this ) shall be construed to grant any rights to any Grantor or to impose any duties on Agent that would not have been granted or imposed by this Agreement or by applicable law in the absence of this ).

Exhibit 10.3
[EXECUTION COPY]
THIS THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED PARENT GUARANTY (as such agreement may be amended, supplemented, modified or amended and restated from time to time, this "Guaranty") dated as of April 23, 2008 is made by ANNTAYLOR STORES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business at 142 West 57th Street, New York, New York 10019 (the "Guarantor"), in favor of BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., in its capacity as Administrative Agent for each of the Lenders now or hereafter party to the Credit Agreement (as defined below) (the "Agent"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Credit Agreement (as defined below).
WHEREAS, ANNTAYLOR, INC., a Delaware corporation ("ATI"), ANNCO, INC., a Delaware corporation ("ANNCO"), ANNTAYLOR DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation ("ATDS"), ANNTAYLOR RETAIL, INC., a Delaware corporation ("ATR" and, together with ATI, ANNCO and ATDS, the "Borrowers" and each, individually, a "Borrower"), the Agent, the lenders referred to therein, the syndication agents named therein and the issuing banks named therein have entered into that certain $175,000,000 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated November 14, 2003 (as amended, the "Original Credit Agreement"); and
WHEREAS, at the Borrowers' request, the Lenders, the Agent, and the syndication agents party thereto, have agreed to amend and restate the Original Credit Agreement in its entirety as of the date hereof (as so amended and restated and as such agreement may be further amended, supplemented, modified, or amended and restated from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"); and
WHEREAS, the Guarantor is the parent of the Borrowers and has and will materially benefit from the Loans made and to be made, and the Letters of Credit issued and to be issued, under the Credit Agreement; and
WHEREAS, the Guarantor and the Agent have entered into that certain Second Amended and Restated Parent Guaranty dated November 14, 2003 (as amended, the "Original Guaranty") pursuant to which the Guarantor has guaranteed the full and prompt payment and performance of the Borrowers' Obligations under the Original Credit Agreement.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises and in order to induce the Lenders and each Letter of Credit Issuer to amend and restate the Original Credit Agreement and continue to, respectively, make Loans and issue Letters of Credit under the Credit Agreement, the Guarantor hereby agrees, and the Agent for its benefit, and for the benefit of the Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers, by acceptance hereof, hereby agrees as follows:
1. .
Guaranty
(a) The Guarantor hereby unconditionally, continually and irrevocably guarantees to the Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers, the full and prompt payment when due, whether at maturity or earlier, by reason of acceleration, mandatory prepayment or otherwise, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement and all other Loan Documents, of all of the Obligations, whether or not from time to time reduced or extinguished or hereafter increased or incurred, whether or not recovery may be or hereafter may become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether enforceable or unenforceable as against the Borrowers, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due (all such indebtedness, liabilities and obligations being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations"). For purposes of this Guaranty, any Affiliate of any Lender, which is a party to a Hedge Agreement or Foreign Currency Exchange Contract with any Borrower or any of its respective Restricted Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a "Lender". This Section 1 continues, reaffirms and amends, as the case may be, the guarantees under the Original Guaranty and the Restated Guaranty.
(b) The Guarantor further agrees that, if any payment made by any Borrower or any other person and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations is at any time annulled, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of Collateral are required to be returned by any of the Lenders or any of the Letter of Credit Issuers to any Borrower, its estate, trustee, receiver or any other party, including, without limitation, the Guarantor, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Guarantor's liability hereunder (and any lien, security interest or other collateral securing such liability) shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made, or, if prior thereto this Guaranty shall have been cancelled or surrendered (and if any lien, security interest or other collateral securing Guarantor's liability hereunder shall have been released or terminated by virtue of such cancellation or surrender), this Guaranty (and such lien, security interest or other collateral) shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the Guarantor in respect of the amount of such payment (or any lien, security interest or other collateral securing such obligation).
(c) The Guarantor further agrees to pay all costs and expenses promptly upon written demand by the Agent including, without limitation, all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses paid or incurred by the Agent in enforcing this Guaranty.
2. . The Guarantor agrees that if any Borrower shall default in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether with respect to principal, interest, premium, fee (including, but not limited to, loan fees and attorneys' fees and expenses), or otherwise, when and as the same shall become due, and after expiration of any applicable grace period, whether according to the terms of the Credit Agreement, by acceleration, or otherwise, or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, then the Guarantor will, upon demand thereof by the Agent, fully pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers, an amount equal to all the Guaranteed Obligations then due and owing.
Payment
 
3. .
Representations and Warranties
The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants to the Agent that each representation and warranty made by Borrowers in Article 6 of the Credit Agreement applicable to the Guarantor is true and correct, which representations and warranties (except such representations and warranties which are expressly made as of a different date) shall survive the execution and delivery of this Guaranty, and shall, except to the extent that the same have been modified by a writing delivered to and accepted in writing by the Agent, and, other than with respect to changes permitted or contemplated by the Credit Agreement, continue to be true and correct on the date of each Loan, and on the date of issuance of each Letter of Credit.
4. .

(a) Subject to the terms hereof and of the other Loan Documents, the Agent is hereby authorized, without notice to or demand upon the Guarantor, which notice or demand is expressly waived hereby, and without discharging or otherwise affecting the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder (which shall remain absolute and unconditional notwithstanding any such action or omission to act), from time to time, to:
(i) supplement, renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or other terms relating to, the Guaranteed Obligations, or otherwise modify, amend, restate or change the terms of any promissory note or other agreement, document or instrument (including the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents) now or hereafter executed by any Borrower and delivered to the Agent, including, without limitation, any increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon;

(iii) accept partial payments on the Guaranteed Obligations;
(iv) receive, take and hold additional security or collateral for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or for the payment of any other guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations or other liabilities of any Borrower, and exchange, enforce, waive, substitute, liquidate, terminate, abandon, fail to perfect, subordinate, transfer, otherwise alter and release any such additional security or collateral;

(vi) settle, release, compromise, collect or otherwise liquidate the Guaranteed Obligations or accept, substitute, release, exchange or otherwise alter, affect or impair any security or collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty therefor, in any manner;
 
(vii) add, release or substitute any one or more other guarantors, makers or endorsers of the Guaranteed Obligations and otherwise enforce its rights under the Loan Agreements against any Borrower or any other guarantor, maker or endorser as the Agent may elect in its sole discretion;

(ix) apply any and all payments or recoveries from the Guarantor or any other guarantor, maker or endorser of the Guaranteed Obligations or sums realized from security furnished by any of them upon any of their indebtedness or obligations to the Agent as the Agent in its sole discretion, may determine, whether or not such indebtedness or obligations relate to the Guaranteed Obligations; and
(x) refund at any time, at the Agent's sole discretion, any payment received by the Agent in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, and payment to the Agent of the amount so refunded shall be fully guaranteed hereby even though prior thereto this Guaranty shall have been cancelled or surrendered (or any release or termination of any collateral by virtue thereof) by the Agent, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder in respect of the amount so refunded (and any collateral so released or terminated shall be reinstated with respect to such obligations);
even if any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantor is extinguished, affected or impaired by any of the foregoing (including, without limitation, any election of remedies by reason of any judicial, non-judicial or other proceeding in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations which impairs any subrogation, reimbursement or other right of Guarantor).
(b) The Guarantor hereby agrees that this Guaranty is a continuing, unconditional guaranty of payment and not of collection and that its obligations under this Guaranty are absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged or otherwise affected as a result of:
(i) the invalidity or unenforceability of any security for or other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any promissory note or other document (including, without limitation, the Credit Agreement) evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or failure of priority of any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guaranty therefor;
(ii) the absence of any attempt to collect the Guaranteed Obligations from the Borrower or any other guarantor or other action to enforce the same;

(x) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, readjustment of debt, liquidation or dissolution proceeding commenced by or against any Borrower, the Guarantor or any other guarantor, maker or endorser, including without limitation, any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations (or any interest thereon) in or as a result of any such proceeding;
(xi) failure by the Agent to file or enforce a claim against the Borrower or its estate in any bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding;
(xii) any action taken by the Agent that is authorized by this Guaranty;
(xiii) any election by the Agent under Section 9-501(4) of the Uniform Commercial Code, or any successor provision, as enacted in any relevant jurisdiction (the "Code") as to any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations; or

(c) The Guarantor hereby waives:
(i) any requirements of diligence or promptness on the part of the Agent;
(ii) presentment, demand for payment or performance and protest and notice of protest with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations;
(iii) notices (A) of nonperformance, (B) of acceptance of this Guaranty, (C) of default in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, (D) of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional indebtedness, arising either from additional loans extended to any Borrower or otherwise, (E) that the principal amount, or any portion thereof, and/or any interest on any

(iv) any right to require the Agent to (a) proceed first against any Borrower, or any other person whatsoever, (b) proceed against or exhaust any security given to or held by the Agent in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations, or (c) pursue any other remedy in the Agent's power whatsoever;
(v) any defense arising by reason of (a) any disability or other defense of any Borrower, (b) the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of any Borrower, (c) any act or omission of the Agent or others which directly or indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise, results in or aids the discharge or release of any Borrower or any security given to or held by the Agent in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations;
(vi) any and all other suretyship defenses under applicable law; and
(vii) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting the Guaranteed Obligations or the Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof.
In connection with the foregoing, the Guarantor covenants that this Guaranty shall not be discharged, except by complete performance of the obligations contained herein.
(d) The Guarantor hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Borrowers, of any and all endorsers and/or other guarantors of any instrument or document evidencing all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof that diligent inquiry would reveal and the Guarantor hereby agrees that the Agent shall not have any duty to advise the Guarantor of information known to the Agent regarding such condition or any such circumstances.
(e) The Guarantor hereby agrees that (i) until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, the commitments of the Lenders to extend credit under the Credit Agreement have been terminated, no Letters of Credit exist that have not been Fully Supported, and the Credit Agreement has been terminated and is of no further force or effect (the "Satisfaction Date") and (ii) during any period that the Guaranteed Obligations may arise or be reinstated after the Satisfaction Date whether pursuant Section 4(h) below or otherwise, the Guarantor agrees that it shall not exercise any claim or other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against any Borrower that arises from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Guarantor's obligations or liabilities under this Guaranty, including any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration or indemnification, any right to participate in any claim or remedy against any Borrower or any collateral which the Agent or any Lender now has or hereafter acquires an interest, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including the right to take or receive from any Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in any manner, payment or security
 
on account of such claim or other rights. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence, such amount shall be deemed to have been paid for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and shall forthwith be paid to the Agent to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, as the Agent may determine.
(f) The Guarantor hereby agrees that any indebtedness of any Borrower now or hereafter owing to the Guarantor is hereby subordinated to all of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether heretofore, now or hereafter created (the "Subordinated Debt"), and that without the prior consent of the Agent, the Subordinated Debt shall not be paid in whole or in part until the Satisfaction Date shall have occurred, except that payments of principal and interest on the Subordinated Debt shall be permitted so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing to the extent such payments would not render such Borrower incapable of performing the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantor will not accept any payment of or on account of any Subordinated Debt at any time in contravention of the foregoing. At the request of the Agent, the applicable Borrower shall pay to the Agent all or any part of the Subordinated Debt and any amount so paid to the Agent shall be applied to payment of the Guaranteed Obligations. Each payment on the Subordinated Debt received in violation of any of the provisions hereof shall be deemed to have been received by Guarantor as trustee for the Agent and shall be paid over to the Agent immediately on account of the Guaranteed Obligations, but without otherwise affecting in any manner the Guarantor's liability under any of the provisions of this Guaranty. The Guarantor agrees to file all claims against the applicable Borrower in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in respect of any Subordinated Debt, and the Agent shall be entitled to all of the Guarantor's right thereunder. If for any reason the Guarantor fails to file such claim at least thirty (30) days prior to the last date on which such claim should be filed, the Agent, as the Guarantor's attorney-in-fact, is hereby authorized to do so in the Guarantor's name or, in the Agent's discretion, to assign such claim to and cause proof of claim to be filed in the name of the Agent or its nominee. In all such cases, whether in administration, bankruptcy or otherwise, the person or persons authorized to pay such claim shall pay to the Agent the full amount payable on the claim in the proceeding, and, to the full extent necessary for that purpose, the Guarantor hereby assigns to the Agent all Guarantor's rights to any payments or distributions to which the Guarantor otherwise would be entitled. If the amount so paid is greater than the Guarantor's liability hereunder, the Agent will pay the excess amount to the party entitled thereto. In addition, until the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in full, the Guarantor hereby appoints Agent as its attorney-in-fact to exercise all of the Guarantor's voting rights in connection with any bankruptcy proceeding or any plan for the reorganization of such Borrower.
(g) The Guarantor shall comply with all covenants stated to be applicable to it under the Credit Agreement. The Guarantor shall also cause each Borrower to comply with all covenants applicable to such Borrower under the Credit Agreement.
(h) The Guarantor agrees that, if any payment made by any Borrower or any other person and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations is at any time annulled, set aside, rescinded, invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential or otherwise required to be refunded or repaid, or the proceeds of any Collateral are required to be returned by the Agent, any of the Lenders and any Letter of Credit Issuer to any Borrower or the Guarantor, its estate, trustee,
 
receiver or any other party, including, without limitation, any guarantor, under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or repayment, the Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty (and any lien, security interest or other collateral securing such liability) shall be and remain in full force and effect, as fully as if such payment had never been made, or, if prior thereto this Guaranty shall have been cancelled or surrendered (and if any lien, security interest or other collateral securing any Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty shall have been released or terminated by virtue of such cancellation or surrender), this Guaranty (and such lien, security interest or other collateral) shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior cancellation or surrender shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty in respect of the amount of such payment (or any lien, security interest or other collateral securing such obligation).
5. .
Default, Remedies
(a) The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are independent of and separate from the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations. If any of the Guaranteed Obligations are not paid when due, or upon any Event of Default, the Agent may, at its sole election, proceed directly and at once against the Guarantor to collect and recover the full amount or any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations, without first proceeding against any Borrower or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations, or against any Collateral for the Guaranteed Obligations under the Loan Documents.
(b) At any time after maturity of the Guaranteed Obligations, the Agent may, without notice to the Guarantor and regardless of the acceptance of any security or collateral for the payment hereof, appropriate and apply toward the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations (i) any indebtedness due or to become due from the Agent to the Guarantor and (ii) any moneys, credits or other property belonging to the Guarantor at any time held by or coming into the possession of the Agent or any of its affiliates.
(c) The Guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers the Agent, in its sole discretion, without any notice (except notices required by law to the extent such notice as a matter of law may not be waived) or demand to the Guarantor whatsoever and without affecting the liability of the Guarantor hereunder, to exercise any right or remedy which the Agent may have available to it, including but not limited to, foreclosure by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, and the Guarantor hereby waives any defense to the recovery by the Agent against the Guarantor of any deficiency after such action, notwithstanding any impairment or loss of any right of reimbursement, contribution, subrogation or other right or remedy against any Borrower, or any other guarantor, maker or endorser, or against any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for any guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations. No exercise by the Agent of, and no omission of the Agent to exercise, any power or authority recognized herein and no impairment or suspension of any right or remedy of the Agent against the Guarantor, any other guarantor, maker or endorser or any security shall in any way suspend, discharge, release, exonerate or otherwise affect any of the Guarantor's obligations hereunder or give to the Guarantor any right of recourse against the Agent, the Lenders or the Letter of Credit Issuers.
 
(d) The Guarantor consents and agrees that the Agent shall not be under any obligation to make any demand upon or pursue or exhaust any of its rights or remedies against any Borrower or any guarantor or others with respect to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, or to pursue or exhaust any of its rights or remedies with respect to any security therefor, or any direct or indirect guaranty thereof or any security for any such guaranty, or to marshal any assets in favor of the Guarantor or against or in payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations or to resort to any security or any such guaranty in any particular order, and all of its rights hereunder, under the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents shall be cumulative. The Guarantor hereby agrees to waive, and does hereby absolutely and irrevocably waive and relinquish the benefit and advantage of, and does hereby covenant not to assert against the Agent any valuation, stay, appraisal, extension or redemption laws now existing or which may hereafter exist which, but for this provision, might be applicable to any sale made under the judgment, order or decree of any court, or privately under the power of sale conferred by this Guaranty or the Security Instruments. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor hereby agrees that it will not invoke or utilize any law which might cause delay in or impede the enforcement of the rights under this Guaranty, the Security Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.
6. .
Miscellaneous
(a) This Guaranty shall be irrevocable as to any and all of the Guaranteed Obligations until the Credit Agreement has been terminated, the commitments of the Lenders to extend credit under the Credit Agreement have been terminated and all Guaranteed Obligations then outstanding have been repaid.
(b) This Guaranty shall be binding upon the Guarantor and upon its successors and assigns, heirs and legal representatives and shall inure to the benefit of the Lenders and the Letter of Credit Issuers; all references herein to the Borrowers and to the Guarantor shall be deemed to include their successors and assigns, heirs and legal representatives as applicable. Each Borrower's successors and assigns shall include a receiver, trustee or debtor-in-possession of or for such Borrower. All references to the singular shall be deemed to include the plural where the context so requires. The Guarantor acknowledges the Agent's acceptance hereof and reliance hereon.
(c) No delay on the part of the Agent in the exercise of any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof, and no single or partial exercise by the Agent of any right or remedy shall preclude any further exercise thereof; nor shall any modification or waiver of any of the provisions of this Guaranty be binding upon the Agent, except as expressly set forth in a writing duly signed and delivered by the Agent or on the Agent's behalf by an authorized officer or agent of the Agent. The Agent's failure at any time or times hereafter to require strict performance by any Borrower or of the Guarantor or any other guarantor of any of the provisions, warranties, terms and conditions contained in any promissory note, security agreement, agreement, guaranty, instrument or document now or at any time or times hereafter executed by any Borrower or the Guarantor or any other guarantor and delivered to the Agent shall not waive, affect or diminish any right of the Agent at any time or times hereafter to demand strict performance thereof and such right shall not be deemed to have been waived by any act or knowledge of the Agent, its agents, officers or employees, unless such waiver is
 
contained in an instrument in writing signed by an officer or agent of the Agent and directed to the Borrowers or the Guarantor, or any of them (as the case may be) specifying such waiver. No waiver by the Agent of any default shall operate as a waiver of any other default or the same default on a future occasion, and no action by the Agent permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair the Agent's rights or the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty. Any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the amount of any principal and/or interest owing by the Borrowers to the Agent shall be conclusive and binding on the Guarantor irrespective of whether it was a party to the suit or action in which such determination was made.
(d) THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ALL RESPECTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND GOVERNED BY, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Whenever possible, each provision of this Guaranty shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Guaranty shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Guaranty.
(e) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HERETO CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH OF PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF , WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS GUARANTY OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO.

Exhibit 99.1
:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced that it now expects earnings per diluted share for the first quarter will exceed its previous guidance range, due primarily to stronger results at LOFT and better overall expense and inventory management.
New York, NY, May 12, 2008
Based upon preliminary figures, the Company's net sales in the fiscal first quarter ended May 3, 2008 increased 2% to approximately $592 million, versus net sales of $580 million in the first quarter ended May 5, 2007. Comparable store sales for the quarter declined 4.3%, with the Ann Taylor division down 11.5% and the LOFT division up 0.7%.
The Company indicated that it currently expects earnings per diluted share for the quarter, excluding previously-announced restructuring costs, to be approximately $0.45-0.47, versus its previous guidance range of $0.35-0.40 per diluted share. The improvement in the Company's earnings per diluted share outlook for the quarter largely reflects stronger results at LOFT, as well as better overall expense and inventory management and the benefit of the Company's share repurchase program. The Company indicated that its inventory per square foot was down approximately 15% at the end of the quarter, with both Ann Taylor and LOFT down significantly.
Commenting on the announcement, Ann Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing macroeconomic softness and the challenges that virtually all consumer products companies are facing. Our two-pronged strategy to focus our resources on our core businesses and improve our cost structure is clearly the right one for these times, and we believe this focus will enable us to continue to create value for our shareholders. Furthermore, given the significant changes in the retail landscape and consumer environment over the past year, we have decided not to pursue our new concept at the present time, but we are moving forward aggressively with the launch of LOFT Outlet this summer."

Ms. Krill continued, "Despite the fact that our first quarter results are tracking ahead of our plan, and we are confident in our business strategy, we remain cautious about our outlook for the balance of the year, given the highly volatile and uncertain nature of the current economic environment. Therefore, at this juncture, as we head into the second quarter, we are maintaining our previous EPS guidance range of $1.80 to $1.90, excluding restructuring costs, for the year."
The Company will report its first quarter results on May 22, 2008.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, ended May 3, 2008. Diluted earnings per share, excluding costs associated with the Company's previously-announced restructuring program, totaled $0.47, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.46 in the first quarter of 2007. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring costs, which totaled $0.04 per diluted share, earnings per diluted share were $0.43 in the first quarter of 2008. Net sales for the first quarter of 2008 advanced 2% versus year-ago.
New York, NY, May 22, 2008
Commenting on the results, Ann Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing macroeconomic softness and uncertainty that is weighing on the retail sector. We are pursuing a two-pronged strategy focused on strengthening our core businesses and improving our cost structure, and this focus is clearly working."
"As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we remain cautious due to the highly volatile nature of the current economic environment, as well as our expectation for a continuation of the erratic traffic trends we are experiencing. We believe, however, that our ability to successfully manage our cost structure and keep our inventory levels lean in this environment will continue to serve us well in the months ahead, and we are comfortable, as we head into the second quarter, that we will achieve our full-year EPS guidance in the range of $1.80 to $1.90, before restructuring costs," Ms. Krill stated.
Net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 advanced 2.0% to $591.7 million, compared with net sales of $580.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. This performance was primarily driven by growth from the LOFT division and, to a lesser extent, our Factory and Internet businesses, partially offset by softness at the Ann Taylor division.
Specifically, net sales at Ann Taylor were $197.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, compared with net sales of $222.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. At LOFT, net sales were $295.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, compared with net sales of $274.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
 
Comparable store sales for the quarter declined 4.3% versus the prior year. By division, comparable store sales at Ann Taylor declined 11.5%, while comparable store sales at LOFT increased 0.7%. Weak traffic trends at both divisions weighed on top-line results, although strong in-store metrics and positive client response to product assortments at LOFT helped to offset the soft traffic.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2008, despite the difficult macroeconomic conditions and a highly promotional retail environment, the Company achieved a gross margin of 53.2%, as a percentage of sales, compared with a gross margin of 53.6% in the year-ago period. This performance reflected strong gross margin results at LOFT and Factory, stemming from successful inventory management and strong product assortments, offset by gross margin softness at Ann Taylor, reflecting a product assortment that lacked the fashion newness clients are currently seeking.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was down 16% versus year-ago, driven by a 17% decline in total in-store inventory. By division, in-store inventory on a per square foot basis at Ann Taylor, excluding Beauty, decreased 23% and, at LOFT, in-store inventory on a per square foot basis declined 22%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 were $270.0 million, or 45.6% of net sales, compared to $261.3 million, or 45.0% of net sales, for the first quarter of fiscal 2007. This performance primarily reflected the negative impact of deleveraging, higher performance-based compensation expense and planned investments in LOFT Outlet, partially offset by restructuring program savings.
During the quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $3.7 million, reflecting $2.2 million in non-cash charges related to the additional write-down of assets associated with planned store closures, and $1.5 million in cash charges. On an after-tax basis, the restructuring charges totaled $2.3 million, or approximately $0.04 per diluted share.
On a GAAP basis, including restructuring costs, operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $41.2 million. Excluding the aforementioned restructuring costs, operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 was $44.9 million, compared with operating income of $49.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
Net income, on a GAAP basis, in the first quarter of 2008 totaled $25.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Excluding the aforementioned restructuring charges, net income in the quarter totaled $28.2 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, versus net income of $31.5 million, or $0.46 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2007. The increase in diluted earnings per share in the 2008 quarter reflected the benefit of a reduced number of weighted shares outstanding.
 
During the quarter, the Company opened four Ann Taylor stores, eight LOFT stores and 13 Ann Taylor Factory stores. The Company closed six Ann Taylor stores and seven LOFT stores during the quarter, in line with the store optimization component of the Company's restructuring program. The total store count at the end of the quarter was 941, comprised of 347 Ann Taylor stores, 513 LOFT stores and 81 Ann Taylor Factory stores. For the year, the Company continues to expect to close 64 stores, as part of its strategic restructuring program. Of these, 25 will be Ann Taylor stores and 39 will be LOFT stores.
The Company indicated that it currently expects to open 66 new stores in fiscal 2008, versus its previous expectation of opening approximately 50-55 new stores. The change in outlook reflects the Company's intention to more aggressively expand Factory and LOFT Outlet openings. In addition, the Company currently plans to open 10 additional LOFT stores, originally expected to be opened in 2009. As a result, the current outlook for 2008 new stores is comprised of 25 LOFT stores, 23 Factory stores, 14 LOFT Outlet stores and four Ann Taylor stores.
The Company repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock during the first quarter, at an approximate cost of $35 million.
The Company indicated that it expects second quarter earnings per diluted share, excluding restructuring costs, to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.47. This outlook reflects the expectation for continued traffic volatility at both divisions, in what is likely to remain a difficult macroeconomic and consumer environment in the months ahead.
The Company reiterated its expectations for earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2008, excluding restructuring costs, to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.90. The Company noted that, while its overall outlook has not changed, the drivers of its expected full-year performance have been modified somewhat to reflect the Company's first quarter results and revised expectations regarding the balance of the year.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced the appointment of Christine M. Beauchamp to the position of President, Ann Taylor Stores, effective immediately.

Commenting on the appointment, Ms. Krill stated, "This transition of leadership at our heritage brand is taking place at an exciting time of evolution for Ann Taylor. I am delighted that Christine, a seasoned retail executive and valued partner to me over the last several months, will be assuming the leadership of our Ann Taylor Stores division. She has a deep understanding of our brand and customer base and will move seamlessly into this critical role. At the same time, I want to thank Adrienne for the many contributions she has made to the Company over the past 17 years."
Added Ms. Beauchamp, "I am delighted to be joining the Company at such an exciting time, and I look forward to unlocking the enormous potential of the Ann Taylor brand."

Commenting on the Company's performance, Ms. Krill stated, "While we have not yet completed our financial close for the second quarter, I am pleased to report that our conservative approach to managing the business in this difficult consumer environment is expected to result in second quarter EPS that exceeds our previous guidance range of $0.42 to $0.47. Furthermore, notwithstanding our better-than-expected results for the first half, we are maintaining our outlook for diluted EPS for the year in the range of $1.80 to $1.90, as the macroeconomic environment remains very weak and uncertain and traffic levels continue to be challenging."
The Company will report its second quarter results on Friday, August 22

During the absence or disability of the President, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or such other officer of the Corporation selected by the Board of Directors in its discretion, shall exercise all the powers and discharge all the duties of the President. The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall also perform such other duties and may exercise such other powers as from time to time may be assigned to him or her by these Bylaws or by the Board of Directors.
Section 4. Chairman of the Board of Directors
. The President shall, subject to the control of the Board of Directors and, if there be one, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, have general supervision of the business of the Corporation and shall see that all orders and resolutions of the Board of Directors are carried into effect. He or she shall execute all bonds, mortgages, contracts and other instruments of the Corporation requiring a seal, under the seal of the Corporation, except where required or permitted by law to be otherwise signed and executed and except that the other officers of the Corporation may sign and execute documents when so authorized by these Bylaws, the Board of Directors or the President. If the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not appointed to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, the President shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation.

At the request of the President or in his absence or in the event of his inability or refusal to act (and if there be no Chairman of the Board of Directors), the Vice President or the Vice Presidents if there is more than one (in the order designated by the Board of Directors) shall perform the duties of the President, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the President. Each Vice President shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors from time to time may prescribe. If there be no Chairman of the Board of Directors and no Vice President, the Board of Directors shall designate the officer of the Corporation who, in the absence of the President or in the event of the inability or refusal of the President to act, shall perform the duties of the President, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the President.

The Secretary shall give, or cause to be given, notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings of the Board of Directors, and shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or President, under whose supervision he shall be. If the Secretary shall be unable or shall refuse to cause to be given notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings of the Board of Directors, and if there be no Assistant Secretary, then either the Board of Directors or the President may choose another officer to cause such notice to be given. The Secretary shall have custody of the seal of the Corporation and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, if there be one, shall have authority to affix the same to any instrument requiring it and when so affixed, it may be attested by the signature of the Secretary or by the signature of any such Assistant Secretary. The Board of Directors may give general authority to any other officer to affix the seal of the Corporation and to attest the affixing by his signature. The Secretary shall see that all books, reports, statements, certificates and other documents and records required by law to be kept or filed are properly kept or filed, as the case may be.

The Treasurer shall have the custody of the corporate funds and securities and shall keep full and accurate accounts of receipts and disbursements in books belonging to the Corporation and shall deposit all moneys and other valuable effects in the name and to the credit of the Corporation in such depositories as may be designated by the Board of Directors. The Treasurer shall disburse the funds of the Corporation as may be ordered by the Board of Directors, taking proper vouchers for such disbursements, and shall render to the President and the Board of Directors, at its regular meetings, or when the Board of Directors so requires, an account of all his transactions as Treasurer and of the financial condition of the Corporation.

Section 9. Assistant Secretaries
. Assistant Treasurers, if there be any, shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to time may be assigned to them by the Board of Directors, the President, any Vice President, if there be one, or the Treasurer, and in the absence of the Treasurer or in the event of his disability or refusal to act, shall perform the duties of the Treasurer, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the Treasurer.

Section 11. Other Officers
. The shares of stock of the Corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that, in accordance with Section 158 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the Board of Directors may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of the Corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. All certificates of stock of the Corporation shall be signed, in the name of the Corporation (i) by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the President or a Vice President and (ii) by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number of shares owned by him in the Corporation.
Section 1. Form of Certificates
 
. Where a certificate is countersigned by (i) a transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee, or (ii) a registrar other than the Corporation or its employee, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.
Section 2. Signatures
. The Board of Directors may direct a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to advertise the same in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give the Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Corporation with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
Section 3. Lost Certificates
. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the manner prescribed by law and in these Bylaws. Transfers of stock shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the record holder of such stock or by his attorney lawfully constituted in writing and, in the case of stock represented by a certificate, upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, which shall be cancelled before a new certificate shall be issued. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock, the Corporation shall send, or cause to be sent, to the record owner thereof a written statement of the information required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to be on certificates.
Section 4. Transfers
. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty days nor less than ten days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any other action. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
Section 5. Record Date
. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive
Section 6. Beneficial Owners
 
dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by law.
. Whenever written notice is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given to any director, member of a committee or stockholder, such notice may be given by mail, addressed to such director, member of a committee or stockholder, at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Written notice may also be given personally or by telegram, telex or cable.
Section 1. Notices
. Whenever any notice is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to be given to any director, member of a committee or stockholder, a waiver thereof in writing, signed, by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.
Section 2. Waivers of Notice
. Dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting, and may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the capital stock. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the Board of Director from time to time, in its absolute discretion, deems proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation, or for any proper purpose, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve.
Section 1. Dividends
. All checks or demands for money and notes of the Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.
Section 2. Disbursements
. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors.
Section 3. Fiscal Year
. The corporate seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the Corporation, the year of its organization and the words "Corporate Seal, Delaware". The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.
Section 4. Corporate Seal
 
. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Section 1. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
nolo contendere
. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
Section 2. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
. Any indemnification under this Article
Section 3. Authorization of Indemnification
 
VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
. For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
Section 4. Good Faith Defined
. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any
Section 5. Indemnification by a Court
 
application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
. Expenses incurred by a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
Section 6. Expenses Payable in Advance
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.
Section 7. Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.
Section 8. Insurance
. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as
Section 9. Certain Definitions
 
he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII.
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 10. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 11. Limitation on Indemnification
. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VIII to directors and officers of the Corporation.
Section 12. Indemnification of Employees and Agents
. These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new Bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new Bylaws be contained in the notice of such meeting of stockholders or Board of Directors as the case may be. All such amendments must be approved by either the holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office. Any alteration, amendment or repeal of Article VIII of these Bylaws shall not adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such alteration, amendment or repeal with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such alteration, amendment or repeal.
Section 1
 
. As used in this Article IX and in these Bylaws generally, the term "entire Board of Directors" means the total number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies.
Section 2. Entire Board of Directors

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (the "Company") issued a Press Release, dated November 6, 2008. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Press Release furnished with this report contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company updated its earnings per share guidance for the quarter ended November 1, 2008 that excludes costs associated with the Company's restructuring program. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist the reader's understanding by removing the impact of the restructuring program from its continuing business operations. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
On November 6, 2008, the Company announced additional actions that build upon the Company's multi-year strategic restructuring program first announced in January 2008 (the "January program"). These additional actions, which include an organizational streamlining and the additional non-cash write-down of store assets, were designed to further reduce the Company's cost structure and enhance its operational efficiency. The Company now expects total ongoing annualized savings under the program to reach $80 to $90 million.
The Company now expects total one-time pre-tax expenses associated with its restructuring initiatives in the range of $65 to $70 million. These costs include the $40 to $45 million originally anticipated under the January program, plus the incremental costs discussed in the next paragraph. As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2008, approximately $10 million of these pre-tax expenses remain under the program and are largely cash expenditures, with approximately $4 million expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and the balance to be incurred in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010.
The Company plans to eliminate approximately 260 positions through an organizational streamlining designed to strategically right-size the corporate and divisional organizations. In connection with this action, the Company will recognize a one-time pre-tax cash charge of approximately $12 million for severance and related costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $12 million in incremental non-cash impairment costs associated with the write-down of store assets related to the Company's store closing plans announced in January.
The above estimated costs and charges are preliminary and may vary materially based on various factors, including timing in execution of the restructuring program and changes in management's assumptions and projections.
The information set forth in Item 2.05 is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.06.
 
AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated November 6, 2008. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

These actions, which include an organizational streamlining announced today, build upon the Company's multi-year strategic restructuring program first announced in January 2008. The Company also reduced its guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
New York, NY, November 6, 2008
Kay Krill, Ann Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer stated, "Following a solid first half performance, during which we effectively navigated a difficult economy, the dramatic deterioration in both the financial markets and the macroeconomic environment in September and October has put additional pressure on the retail industry, in general, and the women's apparel sector, in particular. As a result, third quarter financial results are tracking well below our previous expectations."
Ms. Krill continued, "We are moving more aggressively to accelerate our cost savings initiatives and to ensure our organization is appropriately structured for a recessionary environment. Savings from our January restructuring program are now expected to exceed previous estimates and, combined with the actions announced today, we expect to further improve our cost structure and position the company well for when the economy improves. We are also continuing to very carefully manage our expenses and inventories, and we are preserving our cash. During the third quarter, we did not purchase shares under our existing share repurchase authorization and, in this regard, we plan to continue a conservative approach. In addition, we will be significantly scaling back capital spending in 2009. With the benefit of a strong, debt-free balance sheet and approximately $295 million in available liquidity, including more than $80 million in cash, we are well positioned to support our brands and focus on strengthening our underlying business, even as we take aggressive steps to reduce our cost structure."
Under the expanded strategic restructuring program, which includes the organizational streamlining announced today, the Company expects to generate total ongoing annualized savings of $80-$90 million over the three-year program period, compared to the $50 million previously anticipated. Approximately $35 million of these savings are expected to be realized in fiscal 2008.
Total pre-tax restructuring costs over the three-year period are now expected to be in the range of $65-$70 million. These costs include the $40-45 million originally anticipated under the January program, plus incremental costs of approximately $12 million associated with the

actions announced today, as well as charges totaling approximately $12 million related to additional non-cash write-down of assets associated with the Company's store closure plan announced in January. Approximately $30 million of the one-time costs associated with the program are expected to be incurred in fiscal 2008.
The organizational streamlining involves the strategic right-sizing of the corporate and divisional organizations and is expected to result in ongoing annualized savings, which will benefit both gross margin and selling, general and administrative expenses, of approximately $25 million. The one-time pre-tax charge of approximately $12 million will be incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2008.
With respect to the third quarter ended November 1, 2008, the Company indicated that it expects to report net sales of approximately $527 million, compared to $601 million in the year-ago quarter. Comparable store sales for the third quarter 2008 declined approximately 19% versus the third quarter of 2007, with trends weakening dramatically as the quarter progressed. For the Ann Taylor division, comparable store sales for the third quarter of 2008 declined 25%, and in-store inventory per square foot, excluding Beauty, is expected to be down 20% versus year-ago for the quarter. For the LOFT division, comparable store sales declined 15%, and in-store inventory per square foot is expected to be down 15%. As a result of weaker-than-expected sales and margin for the third quarter, the Company now expects to report earnings per diluted share, excluding restructuring and non-cash impairment costs, of approximately breakeven.
Looking ahead, the Company expects the current weakness in consumer spending to persist through the fourth quarter of 2008 and into 2009. The Company will provide an update of its outlook for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2008 on its third quarter earnings conference call, scheduled for November 21, 2008.

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation issued a Press Release, dated November 21, 2008. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Press Release furnished with this report contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2008, ended November 1, 2008. Earnings per diluted share, excluding restructuring charges, were break-even, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.67, on the same basis, in the third quarter of 2007. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring charges, which totaled $0.24 and $0.01 per diluted share in the third quarters of 2008 and 2007, respectively, loss per diluted share was $0.24 in the third quarter of 2008, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.66 in the third quarter of 2007.
New York, NY, November 21, 2008
Commenting on the results of the quarter, Ann Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "As previously reported, after a solid first-half performance this year, our business turned soft in the third quarter, reflecting the dramatic deterioration in the overall economy and consumer spendingparticularly during the latter part of the period. As a result, we have taken aggressive action to expand the cost reduction initiatives we announced earlier this year and to accelerate and increase the savings we expect from our restructuring program. At the same time, we are also aggressively managing our inventory levels and conserving our cash, to ensure we are well positioned to weather the very weak consumer environment we expect in the months ahead. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, including a solid cash and liquidity position. We are focusing our resources on managing through this difficult period, while also continuing to position our business for growth when the economy improves."
Net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 were $527.2 million, compared with net sales of $600.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2007. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $159.5 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared with net sales of $213.5 million in the third quarter of 2007. At LOFT, net sales were $263.0 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared with net sales of $296.9 million in the third quarter of 2007.
Comparable store sales for the quarter declined 19.4% versus the prior year, with Ann Taylor down 24.8% and LOFT down 15.4%. This performance reflected weakening trends at both divisions as the quarter progressed and was primarily due to the overall impact the dramatic decline both in consumer confidence and spending had on the Company's in-store metrics and sales trends.

Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, declined 7.3 margin points to 48.8% for the third quarter of 2008, compared with a gross margin of 56.1% in the year-ago period. This performance reflected the impact of the top-line weakness and aggressive promotional activity to move through inventory.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the third quarter of 2008 was down 10% versus year-ago, reflecting lower in-store inventory at all divisions and despite the impacts of LOFT Outlet, which was launched in July 2008, and Beauty, which was launched for Holiday 2007. By division, in-store inventory on a per square foot basis at Ann Taylor, excluding Beauty, declined 22% and, at LOFT, in-store inventory on a per square foot basis declined 14%.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2008 declined 4.3%, to $257.5 million, versus selling, general and administrative expenses of $269.0 million for the third quarter of 2007. This improvement reflected the benefit of restructuring savings and tight management of expenses and was achieved despite a 5% increase in the Company's store base versus year-ago and the impact of planned expenses supporting the launch of LOFT Outlet.
During the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $19.9 million, reflecting $12.2 million in cash charges and $7.7 million in non-cash charges. The cash charges incurred during the quarter primarily related to severance associated with the Company's organizational streamlining announced on November 6, 2008. The non-cash charges incurred during the quarter related to the additional write-down of assets associated with the Company's store closure plan announced in January 2008. On an after-tax basis, restructuring charges incurred during the third quarter of 2008 totaled $13.2 million, or approximately $0.24 per diluted share. In the third quarter of 2007, pre-tax restructuring charges totaled $1.3 million, primarily related to consulting services to support the launch of the program. On an after-tax basis, restructuring charges in the third quarter of 2007 totaled $0.8 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share.
Excluding the aforementioned pre-tax restructuring charges, the Company reported essentially break-even operating income in the third quarter of 2008, compared with operating income of $67.9 million in the third quarter of 2007. On a GAAP basis, including restructuring charges, the Company reported an operating loss of $20.2 million in the third quarter of 2008, compared with operating income of $66.6 million in the third quarter of 2007.
Net income, excluding the aforementioned after-tax restructuring charges, was essentially break-even in the third quarter of 2008, compared with net income of $41.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007. On a GAAP basis, including restructuring charges, the Company reported a net loss in the third quarter of 2008 of $13.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, versus net income of $40.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2007.

During the quarter, the Company opened eight LOFT stores, five Ann Taylor Factory stores and two LOFT Outlet stores. The Company closed seven LOFT stores and one Ann Taylor store during the quarter. Total store count at the end of the quarter was 966, comprised of 344 Ann Taylor stores, 520 LOFT stores, 90 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 12 LOFT Outlet stores. For the year, the Company expects to open 66 new stores, comprised of 25 LOFT stores, 23 Factory stores, 14 LOFT Outlet stores and four Ann Taylor stores. As part of its strategic restructuring program, the Company expects to close approximately 60 stores in fiscal 2008, with 33 Ann Taylor stores planned for closure and 27 LOFT stores planned for closure.
The Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock during the third quarter of fiscal 2008. During the first nine months of fiscal 2008, the Company purchased a total of 4.1 million shares, at an approximate cost of $101 million.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2008 were $1.7 billion, compared with net sales of $1.8 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2007. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $542.9 million in the first nine months of 2008, compared with net sales of $652.6 million in the first nine months of 2007. At LOFT, net sales were $857.1 million in the first nine months of 2008, compared with net sales of $881.1 million in the first nine months of 2007.
Comparable store sales for the first nine months of 2008 declined 11.6%, with a 16.7% decline at Ann Taylor and an 8.0% decline at LOFT.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, decreased 1.8 margin points to 51.6% in the first nine months of 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $788.0 million in the first nine months of 2008 were down slightly, versus selling, general and administrative expenses of $789.4 million in the first nine months of 2007.
During the first nine months of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $26.8 million, compared with $2.2 million in the first nine months of 2007. On an after-tax basis, restructuring charges totaled $16.4 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2008, compared with after-tax restructuring charges of $1.3 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2007.
Excluding pre-tax restructuring charges, operating income in the first nine months of 2008 was $94.3 million, compared with operating income of $169.5 million in the first nine months of 2007. On a GAAP basis, including restructuring charges, operating income in the first nine months of 2008 was $67.5 million, compared with operating income of $167.3 million in the first nine months of 2007.

Net income, excluding after-tax restructuring charges, totaled $58.1 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2008, compared with net income of $105.2 million, or $1.63 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2007. On a GAAP basis, including restructuring charges, net income for the first nine months of 2008 was $41.7 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared with net income of $103.9 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2007.
The Company indicated that it currently expects the weakness in consumer spending to persist through the fourth quarter and, as a result, it expects its fourth quarter top-line performance to be consistent with the trends experienced towards the latter part of the third quarter. Furthermore, the Company indicated that it expects the competitive environment to remain highly promotional and, coupled with a fourth quarter receipt plan that did not anticipate the magnitude of the current softness, it expects gross margin to remain under significant pressure. Given the volatility and uncertainty heading into the fourth quarter, the Company is not providing earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter or the full year of fiscal 2008 at this time.
As noted above, the Company indicated that it is focused on preserving cash during the fourth quarter and into 2009 and has therefore significantly scaled back capital spending for next year. The Company indicated that it maintains a strong, debt-free balance sheet and believes that it will maintain a solid cash position throughout the fourth quarter and fiscal 2009.

Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 3. Authorization of Indemnification
. For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
Section 4. Good Faith Defined
 
employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.

. Expenses incurred by a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
Section 6. Expenses Payable in Advance
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.
Section 7. Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or

. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII.
Section 9. Certain Definitions
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 10. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 11. Limitation on Indemnification

AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (the "Company") issued a Press Release, dated March 6, 2009. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Press Release furnished with this report contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The Company is providing operating income, net income and earnings per share data for the quarters and years ended January 31, 2009 and February 2, 2008 that exclude costs associated with the Company's previously-announced restructuring program, as well as goodwill and asset impairment charges. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist the reader's understanding of its continuing business operations by removing the impact of the restructuring charges and other impairment charges. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
 
On March 5, 2009, AnnTaylor, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, accessed $125 million in principal amount under its existing $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the "Facility") to safeguard against ongoing uncertainty in the credit market, and as a cushion, in the event the Company needs incremental capital in the coming months to cover its typical working capital build for Spring. The Facility, which expires in 2013, is led by a diversified consortium of banks headed by Bank of America, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. The Facility was established pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") dated as of April 23, 2008, by and among certain subsidiaries of the Company, the financial institutions from time to time parties thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative and Collateral Agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Wachovia Bank, National Association and RBS Citizens, N.A., as Syndication Agents. The $125 million revolving loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.25% (currently 1.76%).
The Credit Agreement is described under Item 1.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on April 29, 2008, which description is incorporated herein by reference.
 
On March 6, 2009, the Company announced an expansion of the store closure component of its multi-year, strategic restructuring program first announced in January 2008. As a result, the Company now expects to close 163 stores, versus the 117 stores previously identified for closure.
In connection with the restructuring program, the Company recognized approximately $28.8 million in incremental non-cash charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 primarily due to the write-down of store assets. The Company also recognized approximately $4.2 million in cash charges related to severance and other costs associated with the restructuring program.
 
Total one-time costs associated with the Company's restructuring program are now expected to be approximately $95-100 million, with $92 million of these restructuring costs already incurred over the fiscal 2007-2008 period. The balance of $3 to $8 million, primarily cash expenditures, is expected to be incurred in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010. Of the total program costs, approximately $65 million are expected to be non-cash costs primarily related to the write-down of assets associated with store closures. The balance of the program costs are cash charges primarily related to severance and other costs to implement the restructuring program.
The above estimated costs and charges are preliminary and may vary materially based on various factors, including timing in execution of the restructuring program and changes in management's assumptions and projections.
 
The information set forth in Item 2.05 is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.06.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported its results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2008, ended January 31, 2009. The Company indicated that results for both periods were significantly impacted by non-cash charges associated with goodwill and asset impairment, as well as restructuring charges associated with the Company's strategic restructuring program. Taken together, on a pre-tax basis, these charges totaled approximately $346 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $376 million for the full year of 2008. On an after-tax basis, these charges totaled approximately $317 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $337 million for the full year of 2008.
New York, NY, March 6, 2009
Excluding the aforementioned impairments and restructuring charges, the Company reported a net loss of $58.1 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2008, on the same basis, the Company reported net income of $2.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned impairments and restructuring charges, net loss totaled $376 million, or $6.66 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008, and $334 million, or $5.82 per diluted share, for the full year of 2008.
Commenting on the results, Ann Taylor President & Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "The fourth quarter of 2008 was a particularly challenging period for both the overall retail industry and our Company, reflecting extremely weak macroeconomic fundamentals, including historically low consumer confidence and a broad-based decline in consumer spendingparticularly on women's apparel. In addition, the financial crisis and rising unemployment especially impacted our Ann Taylor division, where professional working women represent a large part of our client base.With the lower sales across the sector, increased inventory levels resulted in unprecedented promotional activity. While this activity significantly eroded our gross margin, our Company was successful in clearing through inventory, and we closed the year with total inventory down 32% versus year-ago. In addition, we have planned our Spring inventories extremely conservatively, and we believe we can restore a healthier margin structure to the business beginning in the first quarter of 2009. In fact, we believe that our margin performance in the fourth quarter of 2008 marked a performance trough for the Company, and we expect the first quarter of 2009 to show meaningful margin improvement from the fourth quarter level, due to our much healthier inventory position and ongoing cost reduction focus."
Ms. Krill continued, "Despite the disappointing results we reported for the quarter and the year, our balance sheet and liquidity position remained strong, and we ended the year with $112 million in cash and no bank debt. In addition, to safeguard against ongoing uncertainty in the credit market, we just drew down $125 million of our $250 million revolving credit facility, as a cushion, in the event we need incremental capital in the coming months to cover our typical working capital build for Spring. At the same time, in addition to our ongoing restructuring initiatives, we are aggressively pursuing opportunities to further reduce our cost

structure, including the elimination of merit increases at our corporate offices in 2009. We have also reduced our planned capital spending for 2009 by 65% versus year-ago, and we have taken further action to optimize our real estate portfolio. We believe the decisive actions we have taken to date, along with the plans we have developed for 2009, are prudent in the current environment and position the Company for success when the economy improves."
Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 were $483.4 million, compared with net sales of $600.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $146.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with net sales of $214.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. At LOFT, net sales were $231.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with net sales of $293.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Comparable store sales for the quarter declined 24.5% versus the prior year. At Ann Taylor, comparable store sales declined 29.4% and, at LOFT, comparable stores sales declined 21.9%.
Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, declined to 35.7%, compared with gross margin of 48.7% in the year-ago period. This performance reflected the unprecedented level of promotional activity across the sector to move through inventory.
During the quarter, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment testing and, based on the significant deterioration in macroeconomic fundamentals and the related impact on the Company's market capitalization and performance outlook, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge totaling $286.6 million. The Company also recorded pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges totaling $26.8 million, related to stores not included in the Company's restructuring program.
In addition, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $33.0 million during the quarter, of which $28.8 million were non-cash charges and $4.2 million were cash charges. The non-cash charges incurred during the quarter primarily reflected the write-down of assets associated with additional stores targeted for closure under the Company's store closure plan. The cash charges incurred during the quarter primarily related to severance and other costs associated with the program. In the fourth quarter of 2007, pre-tax restructuring charges totaled $30.1 million.
On an after-tax basis, charges for goodwill and asset impairments as well as restructuring charges, combined, totaled $317 million, or approximately $5.63 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008, versus $18.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2008 declined 3.2% to $265.3 million, versus selling, general and administrative expenses of $274.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2007. This decline in expenses largely reflected the benefit of restructuring savings and aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by operating a larger store base during the year and costs associated with the launch of LOFT Outlet. The Company indicated that, beginning with this release of quarterly results, it will

report the expenses associated with asset impairment of stores not included in the Company's strategic restructuring program on a separate line on its Consolidated Statements of Operations to clarify and enhance the reporting of this non-cash item and enable comparability in reporting of SG&A expenses.
Excluding the aforementioned impairments and restructuring charges, the Company reported an operating loss of $92.8 million during the quarter, compared with operating income of $18.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. On the same basis, the Company reported a net loss in the quarter of $58.1 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with net income of $11.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported an operating loss of $439.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with an operating loss of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. On the same basis, the Company reported a net loss of $375.6 million, or $6.66 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with a net loss of $6.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2007.
The Company generated $59 million of operating cash flow in the quarter and $173 million of operating cash flow for the full year, ending fiscal 2008 with $112 million in cash and cash equivalents.

By division, in-store inventory on a per square foot basis at Ann Taylor declined 27% and, at LOFT, in-store inventory on a per square foot basis declined 41%.
During the quarter, the Company opened one Ann Taylor Factory store and two LOFT Outlet stores. In conjunction with its strategic restructuring program, the Company closed 24 Ann Taylor stores and 10 LOFT stores during the quarter.
The Company did not repurchase shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.
Net sales for the full year of fiscal 2008 were $2.2 billion, compared with net sales of $2.4 billion for the full year of fiscal 2007. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $689.2 million in 2008, compared with net sales of $866.6 million in 2007. At LOFT, net sales were $1,088.4 million in 2008, compared with net sales of $1,174.4 million in 2007.
Comparable store sales for the year decreased 14.8% versus the prior year. By division, comparable stores sales at Ann Taylor decreased 19.9% in fiscal 2008 and, at LOFT, comparable store sales decreased 11.4% in fiscal 2008.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, declined to 48.1% in fiscal 2008, versus 52.2% in fiscal 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,050.6 million for fiscal 2008 declined 1.1%, compared with selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,061.9 million in fiscal 2007.

For the full year, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $286.6 million, as well as asset impairment charges totaling approximately $29.6 million, related to stores not included in the Company's restructuring program. In fiscal 2007, the Company recorded pre-tax asset impairment charges totaling $1.8 million.
The Company also recorded pre-tax restructuring charges for the full year of 2008 totaling $59.7 million, reflecting $39.8 million in non-cash charges and $19.9 million in cash charges. The non-cash charges incurred during the year related primarily to the additional write-down of assets associated with the Company's store closure plan. The cash charges incurred during the year primarily related to severance and other charges associated with the restructuring program. In fiscal 2007, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $32.3 million.
On an after-tax basis, charges for goodwill and asset impairments as well as restructuring charges, combined, totaled $337 million, or $5.87 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008, compared with $20.5 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007.
Excluding the aforementioned impairments and restructuring charges, operating income for fiscal 2008 totaled $4.2 million, compared with operating income of $189.4 million in fiscal 2007. Net income, on the same basis, totaled $2.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in fiscal 2008, compared with net income of $118 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported an operating loss in fiscal 2008 of $371.6 million, compared with operating income of $155.4 million in fiscal 2007. On the same basis, net loss for fiscal 2008 was $333.9 million, or $5.82 per diluted share, compared with net income of $97.2 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in fiscal 2007.
The Company repurchased approximately 4.1 million shares of its common stock during fiscal 2008, at an approximate cost of $101 million, with all fiscal 2008 repurchases occurring in the first half of fiscal 2008.
On January 30, 2008, the Company announced a multi-year, strategic restructuring program, which was subsequently expanded in late fiscal 2008. The three-year program is currently expected to generate total ongoing annualized savings of $80-90 million by 2010, with approximately $40 million of these savings realized in fiscal 2008. For fiscal 2009, the Company expects to generate an additional $35-40 million in savings, with the remainder expected to be generated in fiscal 2010.
The Company has taken aggressive action to expand the store closure component of its restructuring program and now expects to close 163 stores, versus the 117 stores previously identified for closure. The Company closed 60 stores in 2008, comprised of 33 Ann Taylor stores and 27 LOFT stores. The Company opened 66 stores during the year and ended the year with 935 stores, comprised of 320 Ann Taylor stores, 510 LOFT stores, 91 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 14 LOFT Outlet stores. In fiscal 2009, the Company plans to close another 37 stores under the program, comprised of 10 Ann Taylor stores and 27 LOFT stores, with the balance of the stores identified for closure targeted to close in fiscal 2010.

Total one-time costs associated with the three-year strategic restructuring program are now expected to be approximately $95-100 million, with $92 million of these restructuring costs already incurred over the fiscal 2007-2008 period. Of the total program costs, approximately $65 million are expected to be non-cash costs primarily related to the write-down of assets associated with Company's store closure program. The balance of the program costs are cash charges primarily related to severance and other costs to implement the program.
Given the volatility and uncertainty in the retail environment, the Company is not providing specific earnings per share guidance for the first quarter or the full year at this time. The Company indicated that it expects the current weakness in consumer confidence and spending to persist in fiscal 2009 and, as a result, top-line performance in the first quarter is expected to be under significant pressure.
However, the exceptionally clean inventory position with which the Company entered fiscal 2009, along with the Company's very conservative inventory receipt plan for Spring, is expected to enable the Company to emerge from the fourth quarter of 2008which the Company views as its earnings troughpositioned to restore a significantly improved gross margin structure to the business beginning in the first quarter. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter of 2009 are expected to continue to trend favorably on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, reflecting expected restructuring savings and the Company's ongoing cost reduction focus, and are forecasted to be approximately $250 million for the first quarter.
Regarding expectations for the full year, the Company provided the following:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) President and Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill today told shareholders at the Company's Annual Meeting that, while sales results in the first quarter were softer than expectedspecifically at the Ann Taylor divisionthe Company expects to report a stronger bottom line than analysts have been expecting.
New York, NY, May 13, 2009
"Our performance in the first quarter has benefited from strong gross margins and the significant expense savings that we have achieved through our strategic restructuring program. However, our top-line results continued to be negatively impacted by the significant decline in consumer spending, especially for women's apparel, and by a product offering at the Ann Taylor division that was not compelling and did not yet reflect the evolution of the brand, which will begin this Fall. Nevertheless, we did manage our expenses and our inventories very well in the quarter, and we were successful in delivering a first quarter 2009 gross margin rate that was much higher than the gross margin rate we reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result, we expect to report a first quarter 2009 loss per diluted share that is much better than the current First Call consensus estimate," stated Ms. Krill.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the first quarter of fiscal 2009, ended May 2, 2009, which reflected the achievement of strong gross margins and significant expense savings.
New York, NY, May 20, 2009
The Company reported a net loss per diluted share, excluding an after-tax restructuring charge of $0.1 million, of $0.04 in the first quarter of 2009, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.47 in the first quarter of 2008, excluding after-tax restructuring charges of $2.3 million. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring charges, loss per diluted share was $0.04 in the first quarter of 2009, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.43 in the first quarter of 2008.
Commenting on the results, Ann Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "The Company's performance in the quarter reflected a gross margin rate that, despite the difficult retail and consumer environment, exceeded the prior year and was dramatically higher than the gross margin rate we reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, we continued to make meaningful progress in reducing our cost structure. However, our top-line results were very soft, although we anticipated much of this softness and bought our inventories conservatively, which enabled us to achieve the very strong gross margins that we did for the quarter. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage prudently through this difficult period, as we ready the business to enter the Fall season with compelling product assortments positioned for success."
Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $426.7 million, compared with net sales of $591.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $107.4 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with net sales of $197.6 million in the first quarter of 2008. At LOFT, net sales were $223.2 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with net sales of $295.0 million in the first quarter of 2008.

Comparable store sales for the quarter declined 30.7% versus the prior year. At Ann Taylor, comparable store sales declined 42.7%, reflecting the disproportionate impact the current recession is having on the women's apparel sectorparticularly the aspirational luxury sector and apparel for professional working women. In addition, the comparable store sales results at Ann Taylor continued to reflect an assortment that has not yet been repositioned to the modern, chic and sophisticated point of view that will be launched this Fall. At LOFT, comparable stores sales declined 24.2%, reflecting the impact of the recession on women's apparel and LOFT's strategy to maintain significantly lower inventoriesparticularly of markdown product. This strategy pressured comp results for LOFT, but maximized the division's gross margin for the quarter. Importantly, comparable store sales trends at LOFT improved as the quarter progressed, reflecting both improved product assortments and an increasing client response to the unique combination of fashion, quality and value that LOFT offers, particularly in this environment.
Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, increased dramatically to 55.5%, versus the Company's fourth quarter rate of 35.7%. Versus a year ago, gross margin in the quarter advanced 2.3 margin points, compared with a gross margin rate of 53.2% in the first quarter of 2008. This strong gross margin performance reflected the success of the Company's strategy to conservatively position inventory levels in the recessionary environment.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2009 declined approximately $31 million, or 11%, versus year-ago, to $239.4 million, despite a 1% increase in square footage for the quarter. This significant decline in expenses reflected restructuring program savings, as well as aggressive management of expenses.
During the quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $0.2 million, compared with pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2008.
Excluding restructuring charges, the Company reported an operating loss of $2.5 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $44.9 million in the first quarter of 2008. On the same basis, the Company reported a net loss in the quarter of $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared with net income of $28.2 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported an operating loss of $2.7 million in the first quarter of 2009, compared with operating income of $41.2 million in the first quarter of 2008. On the same basis, the Company reported a net loss of $2.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2009, compared with net income of $25.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2008.
The Company ended the first quarter with $199 million in cash and cash equivalents, including $125 million of borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the first quarter of 2009 was down 16% versus year-ago, reflecting a 28% decline at Ann Taylor and a 16% decline at LOFT.
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company opened six LOFT stores and three LOFT Outlet stores and closed two Ann Taylor stores and three LOFT stores. The total store count at the end of the first quarter was 939, comprised of 318 Ann Taylor stores, 513 LOFT stores, 91 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 17 LOFT Outlet stores.

During the quarter, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1, , which required recasting of earnings per share data in prior periods to conform to current periods. The Company indicated that there was virtually no impact from this accounting change in either the 2008 or 2009 first quarter periods.
Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities
The Company remains focused on managing the business conservatively through the current recessionary environment, while simultaneously positioning its brandsespecially Ann Taylorfor an improved second half of 2009. For the second quarter, the Company expects its top-line results to again remain under significant pressure, primarily at the Ann Taylor division. As a result, the Company currently expects only modest improvement in its top-line trend in the second quarter of 2009. At the same time, the Company expects to achieve a solid gross margin rate in the second quarter that is in line with the second quarter of 2008, while selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter are estimated to be approximately $245 million.
For the full year, the Company provided the following:

On July 30, 2009, the Company announced additional actions that expand its previously announced multi-year strategic restructuring program. These additional actions, which include an organizational streamlining, expansion of the Company's strategic non-merchandise procurement initiative, and further optimization of the Company's real estate portfolio, were designed to further reduce the Company's cost structure while improving its efficiency and profitability. The Company now expects total ongoing annualized savings of approximately $125 million under the three-year program ending in fiscal 2010.
The Company now expects total pre-tax restructuring costs associated with its restructuring initiatives in the range of $130 to $140 million, approximately $92 million of which have already been incurred. These costs include the $95 to $100 million previously anticipated under the program, plus incremental one-time costs of approximately $35 to $40 million, the majority of which are expected to be incurred in the second quarter, as discussed in the next paragraph. The Company expects that approximately $3 to $8 million of these pre-tax expenses will remain under the program at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and will be largely cash expenditures.
The Company plans to eliminate approximately 160 positions through an organizational streamlining designed to further right-size the corporate and divisional organizations, as well as make certain changes to its field staffing. In connection with this action, the Company will recognize a one-time pre-tax cash charge of approximately $15 million for severance and other related costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. In addition, the Company expects to incur approximately $20 to $25 million in incremental non-cash impairment costs associated with the further optimization of its real estate portfolio.
The above estimated costs and charges are preliminary and may vary materially based on various factors, including timing in execution of the restructuring program and changes in management's assumptions and projections.
 
The information set forth in Item 2.05 is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.06.
 
AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (the "Company") issued a Press Release, dated July 30, 2009. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The Press Release furnished with this report contains non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company updated its outlook and provided earnings per share guidance for the quarter ending August 1, 2009 that excludes costs associated with the Company's restructuring program.
The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures assist the reader's understanding by removing the impact of the restructuring program from its continuing business operations. These measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today said that it is expanding its previously announced restructuring initiatives and taking further actions to reduce the Company's cost structure and improve profitability. These actions build upon the Company's multi-year strategic restructuring program that was first announced in January 2008. The Company also provided an update on its expectations for the second quarter period ending August 1, 2009.
New York, NY, July 30, 2009
Based on the expanded program, the Company now expects to generate ongoing annualized savings totaling approximately $125 million over the three-year program period ending in fiscal 2010, compared to the $85-$95 million in savings previously anticipated. Approximately $40 million of these savings were generated in fiscal 2008, an incremental $60 million are expected to be realized in the current fiscal year, and the remainder are expected in fiscal 2010.
Kay Krill, Ann Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer stated, "Since we began our strategic restructuring program in January 2008, our goal has been to build a more effective and efficient operational foundation that supports future growth and improved profitability over the long term. In light of the current environment, and encouraged by the process improvements and efficiencies we have achieved to-date, we have now identified additional opportunities to further reduce our SG&A cost structure, while improving our efficiency and profitability. These additional steps are expected to generate approximately $30 million in incremental annualized savings over our previous range. At the same time, we continue to be focused on delivering compelling product and exceptional value to our clients."
The actions announced today include, among other things, further right-sizing of the Company's corporate and divisional organization, changes to our field staffing, expansion of the Company's strategic non-merchandise procurement initiative, and further optimization of the Company's real estate portfolio.
Total pre-tax restructuring costs associated with the Company's multi-year program are now expected to be in the range of $130-$140 million, approximately $92 million of which have already been incurred. These costs include the $95-100 million previously anticipated under the program, plus incremental one-time costs of approximately $35-$40 million. Of these incremental costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred in the second quarter of 2009, approximately $20-25 million are expected to be non-cash costs related to the optimization of our real estate portfolio and approximately $15 million are expected to be cash costs associated primarily with the further streamlining of the organization.
With respect to the second quarter ended August 1, 2009, the Company indicated that it expects to report sales of approximately $470 million. Comparable store sales for the second quarter 2009 will continue to reflect weakness, primarily at the Ann Taylor division.
The Company anticipates its gross margin rate for the second quarter to be in line with the gross margin rate achieved in the second quarter of 2008, while selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to reflect a slight improvement versus the previous outlook of $245 million.
As a result of stronger-than-expected sales and continued cost savings related to its strategic restructuring program, the Company expects its second-quarter earnings per diluted share, excluding restructuring and non-cash impairment costs, to be slightly better than breakeven.
The Company noted that it expects to close the fiscal second quarter with cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $125 million, excluding any borrowings under its revolving credit facility, compared with the $112 million and $74 million in cash and cash equivalents reported at fiscal year-end 2008 and fiscal first quarter-end 2009, respectively, on the same basis.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2009, ended August 1, 2009, which reflected a solid gross margin rate, significant expense savings and better-than-anticipated sales at LOFT.
New York, NY, August 21, 2009
The Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.06 in the second quarter of 2009, excluding after-tax restructuring charges of $21.6 million, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.53 in the second quarter of 2008, excluding after-tax restructuring charges of $2.0 million. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring charges, loss per diluted share was $0.32 in the second quarter of 2009, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.50 in the second quarter of 2008.
Commenting on the results, Ann Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer Kay Krill stated, "During the quarter, we continued to be very disciplined in managing our business, with a relentless focus on keeping our inventories clean, controlling expenses and maximizing gross margin dollars. This strategy served us well, and with better-than-expected sales at LOFT and the ongoing benefit of our cost savings initiatives, we were able to deliver a bottom line result that was ahead of our expectations. In addition, I am pleased with the Company's strong financial position, including the increase in cash on hand since fiscal year-end.
"We are entering the third quarter with a very healthy mix of inventory at both brands that is highly penetrated in new, fresh product for Fall selling. LOFT began the season with a compelling offering of the feminine, casual styles at great value that we are known for, and at Ann Taylor we have begun to flow product into the stores that represents our new brand positioning, with a full Fall lineup expected in stores at the end of the month. Overall, we have strategically positioned our Fall merchandise receipt plans conservatively, with an emphasis on preserving gross margin in a soft consumer spending environment that is expected to continue to affect our top line."
Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2009 were $470.2 million, compared with net sales of $592.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $108.9 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with net sales of $185.7 million in the second quarter of 2008. At LOFT, net sales were $250.5 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with net sales of $299.1 million in the second quarter of 2008.
Comparable store sales for the quarter declined 22.5% versus the prior year. At Ann Taylor, comparable store sales declined 38.0%, reflecting the continued impact of the economy on the women's apparel sector and the final few months of the Spring product assortment, which was not reflective of the brand's new direction. At LOFT, comparable stores sales declined 15.4%.
Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, was 52.4%, equivalent to the gross margin rate achieved in the second quarter of 2008. This solid gross margin performance reflected the success of the Company's strategy to conservatively position inventory levels and an improved performance at LOFT, partially offset by aggressive promotional activity at Ann Taylor to clear through Spring inventories in advance of the Fall product launch.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2009 declined by approximately $20.3 million, or approximately 8% versus year-ago, to $240.0 million, relative to a 2% decline in square footage for the quarter. This significant decline in expenses reflected restructuring program savings, as well as continued aggressive management of expenses.
During the quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $31.1 million, associated with its previously announced strategic restructuring program, compared with pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2008. Of these pre-tax second-quarter restructuring charges, approximately $21 million were costs associated with the optimization of our real estate portfolio and approximately $10 million were costs associated primarily with the further streamlining of the organization.
Excluding restructuring charges, the Company reported operating income of $6.0 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $49.7 million in the second quarter of 2008. On the same basis, the Company reported net income in the quarter of $3.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared with net income of $31.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported an operating loss of $25.2 million in the second quarter of 2009, compared with operating income of $46.5 million in the second quarter of 2008. On the same basis, the Company reported a net loss of $18.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009, compared with net income of $29.3 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2008.
The Company ended the second quarter with $129 million in cash and cash equivalents, excluding the benefit of $75 million of borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility. During the quarter, the Company paid down $50 million on its revolving credit facility.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the second quarter of 2009 was down 28% versus year-ago, reflecting a 30% decline at Ann Taylor and a 30% decline at LOFT.
During the second quarter of 2009, the Company opened two LOFT stores, one Ann Taylor Factory store and one LOFT Outlet store and closed three Ann Taylor stores and seven LOFT stores. The total store count at the end of the second quarter was 933, comprised of 315 Ann Taylor stores, 508 LOFT stores, 92 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 18 LOFT Outlet stores.
During the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position EITF 03-6-1, , which required recasting of earnings per share data in prior periods to conform to current periods. The Company indicated that there was minimal impact from this accounting change in the 2008 and 2009 second quarter and first half periods.
Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions are Participating Securities
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2009 were $897 million, compared with net sales of $1,184 million in the first half of fiscal 2008. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $216.3 million in the first half of 2009, compared with net sales of $383.3 million in the first half of 2008. At LOFT, net sales were $473.8 million in the first half of 2009, compared with net sales of $594.1 million in the first half of 2008.
Comparable store sales for the first half of 2009 declined 26.6%, with a 40.4% decline at Ann Taylor and a 19.8% decline at LOFT.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased 1.1 margin points to 53.9% in the first half of 2009, compared to the first half of 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined by approximately $51.7 million, or nearly 10% versus year-ago, to $478.8 million in the first half of 2009, relative to a square footage decline of 2%.
During the first six months of 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $32.1 million, compared with $6.9 million in the first six months of 2008. On an after-tax basis, restructuring charges totaled $22.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2009, compared with restructuring charges of $4.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2008.
Excluding the aforementioned pre-tax restructuring costs, operating income in the first half of 2009 was $4.2 million, compared with operating income of $94.6 million in the first half of 2008. On a GAAP basis, including restructuring costs, operating loss in the first half of 2009 was $27.9 million, compared with operating income of $87.7 million in the first half of 2008.
Net income, excluding the aforementioned after-tax restructuring charges, totaled $2.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2009, compared with net income of $59.4 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, for the first six months of 2008. On a GAAP basis, including restructuring costs, net loss for the first half of 2009 was $20.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared with net income of $55.1 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the first half of 2008.
On July 30, 2009, the Company updated expectations related to its strategic restructuring program. The program is expected to generate total ongoing annualized savings of $125 million over the 2008-2010 period. Of these, approximately $40 million in savings were realized in fiscal 2008, an incremental $60 million is expected to be generated in fiscal 2009, and the remainder is expected in fiscal 2010.
Costs for the multi-year program are expected to total $130-140 million, of which approximately $80 million are expected to be non-cash costs and $50-60 million are expected to be cash costs. Approximately $124 million of these program costs have already been incurred as of the second quarter of 2009.
The Company will continue to manage the business conservatively through the current environment, with an ongoing focus on maximizing gross margin dollar performance and tightly managing inventories and expenses, while investing prudently in marketing initiatives for both Ann Taylor and LOFT throughout the remainder of fiscal 2009.
For the third quarter, the Company expects a slight sequential improvement in both total sales and gross margin rate performance from the levels achieved in the second quarter of 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter are estimated to be approximately $250 million, with the sequential increase versus the second quarter of 2009 primarily reflecting an incremental marketing investment of approximately $10 million in support of the new Fall product launch at both divisions.
For the full year, the Company provided the following outlook:

Exhibit 99.1
:
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the third quarter of fiscal 2009, ended October 31, 2009.
New York, NY, November 20, 2009
For the quarter, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.20 excluding after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of $0.17 per diluted share, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.03 in the third quarter of 2008, excluding after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling $0.27 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring and impairment charges, earnings per diluted share was $0.03 in the third quarter of 2009, compared with a loss per diluted share of $0.24 in the third quarter of 2008.
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our results for the quarter were a direct result of our strategy to maximize gross margin performance by tightly managing inventories, focusing on full-price selling and controlling costs. I am pleased that our performance also reflects the cumulative benefits of our ongoing restructuring program initiatives. Today, we are a more efficient and effective Company. Our emphasis going forward is to continue the repositioning of the Ann Taylor division and to ensure that LOFT further strengthens its positioning as the destination for casual, feminine and stylish product at great value.
"We have made significant progress on enhancing and differentiating our brands and providing our clients with style, quality and value. LOFT's product offering resonated with our clients, with casual apparel performing particularly well. I am pleased with the response to our newer categories, which expand the LOFT brand to better serve our clients' lifestyle needs. At Ann Taylor, the launch of the new Fall collection was an important first step in our multi-season strategy to reposition the brand. The initial client response has been encouraging, and we look forward to further progress as we continue to test, learn from and refine the assortment. Looking ahead, we expect to build on the product successes we've achieved to date and move forward on our objective of building sales momentum and profitable growth."
Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2009 were $462.4 million, compared with net sales of $527.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2008. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $112.3 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared with net sales of $159.5 million in the third quarter of 2008. At LOFT, net sales were $234.0 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared with net sales of $263.0 million in the third quarter of 2008.
Comparable store sales for the quarter declined 13.7% versus the prior year. At Ann Taylor, comparable store sales declined 25.8% and at LOFT, comparable stores sales declined 9.7%.
Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, was 57.3%, 850 basis points higher than the gross margin rate achieved in the third quarter of 2008. This strong gross margin performance reflected the success of the Company's strategy to conservatively position inventory levels across both divisions as well as a lower level of promotional activity in the quarter.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2009 declined by approximately $8.6 million, or 3.4% versus year-ago, to $246.2 million, relative to a 2.5% decline in weighted average square footage for the quarter. This decline in expenses reflected restructuring program savings, as well as continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by an increase in performance-based compensation versus the 2008 period.
During the quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $0.6 million associated with its previously announced strategic restructuring program, compared with pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $19.9 million in the third quarter of 2008. On an after-tax basis, third quarter 2009 restructuring charges totaled $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared with total restructuring charges of $13.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008.
The Company also recorded pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges totaling $15.3 million related to stores not included in the Company's restructuring program, compared with pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges totaling $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2008. On an after-tax basis, third quarter 2009 asset impairment charges totaled $10.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared with after-tax asset impairment charges of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008.
Excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, the Company reported operating income of $18.7 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2008. On the same basis, the Company reported net income in the quarter of $12.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared with net income of $1.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2008. The tax rate used to calculate non-GAAP after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges and non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2009 was adjusted to remove the cumulative impact of an updated full year estimated effective tax rate, and therefore reflects the expected rate for the period.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported operating income of $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2009, compared with an operating loss of $20.2 million in the third quarter of 2008. On the same basis, the Company reported net income of $2.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009, compared with a net loss of $13.4 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2008.
During the third quarter of 2009, the Company opened one LOFT store and closed one Ann Taylor store and one LOFT store. In addition, we converted one Ann Taylor store to LOFT. The total store count at the end of the third quarter was 932, comprised of 313 Ann Taylor stores, 509 LOFT stores, 92 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 18 LOFT Outlet stores.
During the quarter, the Company paid down the balance of outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility, totaling $75 million. Following the debt pay down, the Company ended the third quarter with $134 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the third quarter of 2009 was down 20.7% versus year-ago, primarily reflecting total inventory declines of 19.4% and 17.0% per square foot at the LOFT and Ann Taylor divisions, respectively.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2009 were $1.4 billion, compared with net sales of $1.7 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2008. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $328.6 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared with net sales of $542.9 million in the first nine months of 2008. At LOFT, net sales were $707.7 million in the first nine months of 2009, compared with net sales of $857.1 million in the first nine months of 2008.
Comparable store sales for the first nine months of 2009 declined 22.6%, with a 36.1% decline at Ann Taylor and a 16.7% decline at LOFT.
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, increased 340 basis points to 55.0% in the first nine months of 2009, compared to the first nine months of 2008. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined by approximately $60.2 million, or 7.7% versus year-ago, to $725.0 million in the first nine months of 2009, relative to a weighted average square footage decline of 0.6%.
During the first nine months of 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $32.7 million, compared with pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $26.8 million in the first nine months of 2008. On an after-tax basis, restructuring charges for the first nine months of 2009 totaled $22.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with total restructuring charges of $16.4 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2008.
The Company also recorded pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges totaling $15.3 million in the first nine months of 2009, related to stores not included in the Company's restructuring program, compared with pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges totaling $2.8 million in the first nine months of 2008. On an after-tax basis, asset impairment charges in the first nine months of 2009 totaled $10.3 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared with after-tax asset impairment charges of $1.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2008.
Excluding the aforementioned pre-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges, operating income in the first nine months of 2009 was $22.9 million, compared with operating income of $97.0 million in the first nine months of 2008. On a GAAP basis, including restructuring and asset impairment charges, operating loss in the first nine months of 2009 was $25.2 million, compared with operating income of $67.5 million in the first nine months of 2008.
Net income, excluding the aforementioned after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges, totaled $14.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2009, compared with net income of $59.8 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2008. On a GAAP basis, including restructuring and asset impairment charges, net loss for the first nine months of 2009 was $18.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with net income of $41.7 million, or $0.71 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2008.
The Company's Strategic Restructuring Program, which was launched in January 2008, is expected to generate total ongoing annualized savings of $125 million over the 2008-2010 period. Of these, approximately $40 million in savings were realized in fiscal 2008, an incremental $60 million is expected to be generated in fiscal 2009, and the remainder is expected in fiscal 2010.
Costs for the multi-year program are expected to total $130-140 million, of which approximately $80 million are expected to be non-cash costs and $50-60 million are expected to be cash costs. Approximately $125 million of these program costs have already been incurred as of the third quarter of 2009.
The Company will continue to manage the business with a focus on gross margin performance, tightly managing inventories and expenses, and being competitive in what the Company expects to be a highly promotional retail environment in the fourth quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2009, ended January 30, 2010, and provided an outlook for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2010.
New York, NY, March 12, 2010
For the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.05, excluding after-tax restructuring charges of $0.05 per diluted share, compared with a net loss per diluted share of $1.03 in the fourth quarter of 2008, excluding after-tax restructuring, goodwill and asset impairment charges totaling $5.63 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring and impairment charges, earnings per diluted share were breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with a loss per diluted share of $6.66 in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "Fiscal 2009 ended on a strong note, with fourth quarter results coming in ahead of our expectations. Our success was driven by compelling product at both Ann Taylor and LOFT, our well-executed promotional strategy and effective inventory management. Together, these accomplishments during the quarter translated into significantly improved sales and margin trends, including a substantial increase in full-price selling compared to last year, as well as higher profitability and earnings.
"We are pleased that we entered fiscal 2010 in a solid position. We have strong momentum into the first quarter, with both brands achieving comparable store sales increases of approximately 10% in February. Ann Taylor's repositioning continues to gain traction and we are excited about the product and marketing initiatives we have underway to drive continued sales improvement. LOFT also continues to refine and expand upon its proven formula of offering compelling and relevant fashion at great value, and we look forward to this brand's ongoing growth. We ended the year with a healthy balance sheet and no bank debt. Importantly, even as we take steps to enhance sales growth in 2010, we will be focused on delivering strong gross margin performance with a disciplined approach to inventory management. We have a talented team in place to drive profitable results and future growth."
Net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 were $469.1 million, compared with net sales of $483.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. By division, net sales at Ann Taylor were $128.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with net sales of $146.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. At LOFT, net sales were $232.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with net sales of $231.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Comparable store sales for the quarter were essentially flat, at negative 0.6% versus the prior year. At Ann Taylor, comparable store sales declined 7.3% while at LOFT, comparable stores sales increased 2.1%.
Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, was 52.5%, reflecting a 1,680 basis point increase versus the gross margin rate achieved in the fourth quarter of 2008. This strong gross margin performance reflected improved product at both divisions, a lower level of promotional activity during the quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, and the success of the Company's strategy to conservatively position inventory levels.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2009 declined by nearly $24 million, or approximately 9% versus year-ago, to $241.6 million, relative to a 3% decline in weighted average square footage for the quarter. This decline in expenses reflected restructuring program savings, as well as continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by incremental marketing investment as well as an increase in performance-based compensation expense versus the 2008 period.
During the quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $3.6 million associated with its previously announced strategic restructuring program, compared with $33.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. On an after-tax basis, fourth quarter 2009 restructuring charges totaled $2.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with $21.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges related to stores not included in the Company's restructuring program and a pre-tax non-cash goodwill charge that, together, totaled $313.4 million. On an after-tax basis, these charges totaled $296.4 million, or $5.26 per diluted share. There were no such charges recorded during the fourth quarter of 2009.
Excluding the aforementioned charges, the Company reported operating income of $4.9 million for the quarter, compared with an operating loss of $92.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. On the same basis, the Company reported net income in the quarter of $2.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $58.1 million, or $1.03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008. The tax rate used to calculate non-GAAP after-tax restructuring charges and non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was based on the Company's full year effective tax rate.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported operating income of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with an operating loss of $439.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. On the same basis, the Company reported net income that was approximately breakeven, or $0.00 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with a net loss of $375.6 million, or $6.66 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2008.

The Company ended the year with approximately $204 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of fiscal 2009 was flat versus year-ago, reflecting increases at both Ann Taylor and LOFT offset by a decline in factory channel inventory. Total inventory per square foot increased 13.5% at the Ann Taylor division and 6.4% at the LOFT division, reflecting the earlier delivery of Spring product compared to last year.
During fiscal 2009, the Company opened nine LOFT stores, one Ann Taylor Factory store and four LOFT Outlet stores, and closed 18 Ann Taylor stores and 24 LOFT stores. In addition, the Company converted 11 Ann Taylor stores to LOFT. The total store count at the end of the fiscal year was 907, comprised of 291 Ann Taylor stores, 506 LOFT stores, 92 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 18 LOFT Outlet stores.
The Company's Strategic Restructuring Program, which was launched in January 2008, is expected to generate total ongoing annualized savings of approximately $125 million over the 2008-2010 period, of which approximately $90 million represents SG&A savings and the remaining $35 million represents gross margin savings. Approximately $40 million in restructuring savings were generated in fiscal 2008, an incremental $65 million were generated in fiscal 2009, and the remainder is expected to be realized in fiscal 2010.
Costs for the multi-year program are expected to total $130-140 million, of which approximately $85 million are expected to be non-cash costs and $45-55 million are expected to be cash costs. Approximately $128 million of these program costs have been incurred through the end of fiscal 2009.
The Company also updated expectations related to the store closure component of its strategic restructuring program. Under the program, the Company closed 60 stores in fiscal 2008, 42 stores in fiscal 2009, and expects to close approximately 72 stores in fiscal 2010, for a total of approximately 174 store closures under the 3-year program. Of these, approximately half are expected to be Ann Taylor stores and half are expected to be LOFT stores.
For the fiscal first quarter of 2010, the Company expects total net sales to be approximately $445 million. Gross margin rate performance is expected to be approximately 100 basis points better than the levels achieved in the first quarter of 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to be approximately $240 million, including approximately $5 million in incremental marketing investment to drive ongoing sales momentum, compared with the first quarter of 2009.
In line with its strategic objectives, the Company will continue to focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet, including a disciplined approach to inventory management.
In terms of the full year, the Company provided the following outlook:

Thank you, Katherine and good morning everyone. We're very pleased you could join us to review our results for the first quarter of 2010. I'm here today with Kay Krill, AnnTaylor's President and CEO and Mike Nicholson, our CFO. Kay will begin with an overview of the quarter, then Mike will review the financials in more detail and provide an update for our outlook for the balance of the year. After that, we'll open it up for questions.
Before turning it over to Kay, we would like to remind you that our discussion this morning includes forward-looking statements which are subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements reflect the Company's current expectations concerning future events, and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, let me turn it over to Kay.
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
Good morning. And thanks for joining us. I'm pleased to report on the Company's strong performance for the first quarter of 2010. The year is off to an excellent start, with both AnnTaylor and Loft performing well ahead of our initial expectations. A dramatic uptick in sales, coupled with our continued focus on maximizing gross margins, enabled us to deliver significantly stronger results, both sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2009, and versus the year-ago period. We are very excited about our progress in both brands and all channels. When I spoke to you in March, I noted that a key objective for 2010 was to profitably grow our top line sales.
Clearly, the first quarter performance was a significant step in that direction. For the Company, comparable sales rose 14%, with both brands achieving a significant increase in sales and profitability. As you saw in our press release this morning, we are now providing enhanced transparency on our results by brand and channel. Beginning this quarter, we are giving you our results as we, and frankly our clients, view the business. As two brands, each with three channels. The AnnTaylor brand, including stores, our e-commerce channel, and AnnTaylor Factory, delivered positive comps during the quarter of 16.4%. For the Loft brand, again including stores, our e-commerce channel and Loft Outlet, achieved a comp gain of 12.5%.
Another highlight of the quarter was our gross margin rate, which reached 59.4%, and reflects our ongoing focus on growing full priced sales. One more compelling product assortment was the primary reason for our success, which bodes well for the future, as we are winning back customers and appealing to new customers as well. An effective promotional strategy and well-managed inventory levels were also key drivers of the performance, as we continue to run the business to optimize profitability. Both brands started the quarter on a strong note, with sales accelerating in March in advance of the Easter holiday. Traffic was up at both brands, and our clients' response to the product remained positive throughout the quarter as our newer spring assortments hit the floor. In fact, we achieved positive comps in every month of the quarter. Clearly, we have been delivering compelling fashion and value and she is responding.
Let's take a closer look at each of the brands. Turning first to AnnTaylor. Overall, the AnnTaylor brand achieved an excellent performance, with both sales and gross margin coming in well ahead of our expectations. We continue to make meaningful progress in our multi-season strategy to enhance and grow the brand and this is reflected in the improved metrics across the business. In the AnnTaylor stores and e-commerce channel, the combined 19% comp increase represents an acceleration of positive momentum, since the brand evolution began in fall 2009. Strong full priced selling drove this performance, with the full priced sales comp significantly outpacing the overall comp performance. Our Ann client is demonstrating a strong appetite for fashion and newness and she is clearly recognizing our value proposition and compelling assortment, both in-store and online.
From a product perspective, our wear to work categories performed well, including suiting, sportswear separates and dresses. We achieved greater momentum in tops in both knits and wovens and improved results in pants, where we have tweaked our assortments, adding new fits and fabrications, and greater diversity to the category. Accessories remained a standout and we continue to chase inventory across the category in response to the high demand. Another primary driver of our success was
 
our strategy to offer more attractive opening price points across the assortment, particularly in the categories of pants and tops. The value we offered resonated positively with our clients, and also contributed to our significantly improved results. AnnTaylor's strong product offering was supported by a successful promotional strategy that drove sales while delivering a significantly higher gross margin.
Importantly, all of AnnTaylor's promotions were pre-planned. We even canceled a number of our planned promotions throughout the quarter, because of the strength of the business. In AnnTaylor's e-commerce channel, the product performance mirrored the success of the store performance and was also further enhanced by an expanded style assortment. We are very pleased with the significant improvement in sales, double-digit traffic growth and gross margin delivery in this channel, and continue to view our online business as an area of great opportunity.
On the marketing front, we continue to move forward with our multi-touch strategy to drive greater interest and excitement in the brand. We engaged lapsed clients and attract new ones. We are encouraged by the results we are generating including positive traffic increases in-store and online, and we will continue to invest, albeit cost effectively, to support the brand's top line growth.
From a real estate perspective, our 2010 strategy for AnnTaylor Stores focuses on optimizing the productivity and enhancing the in-store environment of our existing fleet, while the brand evolution continues to gain momentum. We will also introduce our new AnnTaylor store prototype in three markets during the third quarter. The new environment better reflects our updated brand aesthetic. We expect the new prototype to deliver a highly engaging client experience within a box that is roughly 40% smaller than our current average store.
Within the Outlet channel, AnnTaylor Factory's performance remains strong, delivering comps of nearly 11% for the quarter, which reflected improved conversion as well as an increase in dollars per transaction. This channel continues to offer the AnnTaylor aesthetic at tremendous value to the Outlet shopper, allowing us to further extend the reach of the brand. In summary, the AnnTaylor brand made significant progress, and our team is very energized and focused on the opportunities that lie ahead.
Now, let's turn to Loft. As you know, our focus in 2010 is to continue the strong momentum Loft has achieved over the past year, and to further capitalize on the growth potential of the brand. Certainly, the momentum continued this quarter, with the positive results we generated in each of the brand's channels. Loft stores and Loft online delivered a combined 12% comp sales increase, and continued to generate strong gross margin. Higher full priced sales drove this performance, with clients responding strongly to the accessible fashion and newness that Loft provides. During the quarter, our metrics showed much improvement over last year, and we are particularly pleased that in stores, every region generated a positive comp in both traffic and sales.
In terms of product, pants, shorts, skirts, denim, woven tops, jackets and outerwear all performed particularly well, accessories continue to be an area of strength highlighted by exceptional results in jewelry, and a positive response to our expanded shoe assortment. Loft Lounge also exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Our strong product offering, coupled with a prudent inventory position, enabled us to be strategic in our promotional stance. We effectively timed promotional activity to be competitive, and to respond to our clients' desire for value. Loft too stepped back from planned promotions during the quarter due to the strength of its performance.
Within the online channel, Loft experienced a nearly 40% improvement in traffic versus last year's first quarter. This, coupled with a notable increase in dollars per transaction, were the primary drivers of the 60% sales growth in Loft's e-commerce channel for the quarter. Loft Outlet also performed ahead of our expectations during the quarter, achieving a 24% comp. Compelling product and price points drove higher units and dollars per transaction. From a marketing perspective, we continue to be pleased with the results of Loft's strategy, which utilizes a combination of direct outreach, advertising, PR, and in-store events. A highlight for the quarter was Loft's March style event, which received an outstanding response from clients and drove significant incremental sales.
 
With respect to real estate, we are moving forward with our plans to add approximately 10 Loft stores in 2010, and we successfully opened a new Loft prototype earlier this month. For the Outlet channel, with just 18 stores as of the first quarter, Loft Outlet is an attractive growth vehicle with significant long-term potential. We plan to open approximately 20 Loft Outlet locations in the second half of the year. The selective growth of our Loft and Loft Outlet store base will complement our continued strategy to drive sales growth and enhance the overall productivity of our existing fleet, to help drive further profitable expansion of the brand. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for Loft, as our client responded positively to our product assortments and tremendous value.
So in summary, this year's first quarter represented a dramatic improvement from a year ago, and we believe our progress will continue throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. The AnnTaylor brand is making significant headway in its evolution, and Loft is building on its already strong foundation, and we are encouraged that both of our brands are demonstrating a high degree of differentiation in the marketplace and both delivered strong results. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, our plan is focused on increasing top line sales and productivity, investing in the growth of our successful e-commerce business, continuing to elevate the client experience across all of our channels through consistent delivery of high quality fashion at compelling value, remaining disciplined in our approach to maximizing gross margin, managing inventory, and controlling expenses, and utilizing our strong balance sheet and free cash to further enhance shareholder value.
We have a highly talented and seasoned management team in place. Our strategies continue to gain traction and our financial position is strong. Let me now turn it over to Mike.
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
Thanks, Kay. And good morning, everyone. As Kaye mentioned, we are pleased with our results for the first quarter, and I find it particularly rewarding that the hard work we've done internally over the past two years to reduce our cost structure and improve our efficiency is translating into greater profitability as we deliver improved top line productivity.
We remain committed to maintaining the discipline we've instilled in our business through the restructuring process. Let me start this morning with a review of our results for the first quarter. Net sales for the quarter increased 11.6% versus year-ago, to $476.2 million, on total comps that were up 14.1%. Net sales at the AnnTaylor brand, including stores, e-commerce, and the Outlet channel, increased 11.3% to $198.4 million, on a comp improvement of 16.4%. At Loft, total brand net sales increased 11.8% to $277.8 million on a comp increase of 12.5%.
As Kay mentioned earlier, our brand comparable sales figures now incorporate stores, e-commerce, and Outlet channels, and a detailed breakdown by channel may be found on table three of this morning's earnings release. Our gross margin rate for the quarter of 59.4% reflected an increase of 390 basis points above the 55.5% reported last year. This performance primarily reflected improved product at both divisions, a lower level of promotional activity during the quarter compared with the first quarter of 2009, and disciplined inventory management. We closed the quarter with total inventory per square foot that was down 2.3% compared to last year, reflecting an 11.5% increase at AnnTaylor Stores, a 3.1% decline at Loft stores and double-digit declines in the Outlet channels at both brands.
Both brands entered the second quarter with very low levels of carryover inventory. At AnnTaylor Stores, carryover, which we define as March store set and prior, is down approximately 35% compared to last year. As of the end of the first quarter, more than 85% of our mix consisted of fresh spring product. At Loft stores, carryover inventory is essentially in line with last year, and approximately 95% of Loft's mix consisted of fresh spring product.
Turning now to SG&A. Total SG&A expenses for the quarter increased 2.2% or approximately $5 million to $244 million. This reflected savings from our restructuring program, offset by an incremental $7 million in marketing investment to support our brands, variable store operating expenses related to an improvement in volume, and an increase in performance based compensation relative to the first quarter of 2009. During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of approximately
 
$400,000, compared with a pretax restructuring charge of $1 million in last year's first quarter. On an after tax basis, restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2010 totaled $200,000, with no impact on EPS, compared with an after tax restructuring charge of $700,000 or $0.01 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
Excluding the aforementioned restructuring charges, we reported operating income in the quarter of $39.1 million, compared with an operating loss of $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2009. On the same basis, we reported net income of $22.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share during the quarter, compared with a net loss of $1.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter increased 3.3% to 58.4 million shares, versus 56.6 million shares in the first quarter of 2009 and was primarily due to the effect of stock options and restricted stock in the current year, which were excluded from diluted shares outstanding in 2009 due to the net loss for the period.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 41.3% versus 28.2% in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter tax rate reflected the impact of permanent items in a period of net income versus a period of net loss, a change in the mix of earnings in various state taxing jurisdictions, and certain discrete items. We anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 40% for the full year. Depreciation and amortization in the first quarter totaled approximately $24.8 million, compared with approximately $27 million in the first quarter of 2009. Capital expenditures in the first quarter totaled $8.3 million, compared with $11.7 million in the first quarter of 2009.
During the first quarter, we closed a total of four stores, three AnnTaylor Stores and one Loft store, and did not open any new stores. In addition, we converted five stores from AnnTaylor to Loft during the quarter. You'll note in our release that we now expect to close a total of 61 stores in fiscal 2010, down from our earlier target of 72 stores. Since we began our three-year strategic restructuring program in January of 2008, our store closure program has fluctuated to reflect both macroeconomic dynamics as well as real estate opportunities and we plan to continue to proactively manage our real estate portfolio going forward.
During the quarter, as part of our ongoing analysis of our real estate base, we've noted improved performance at several stores, and consequently decided that they will not be closed in 2010. As we have done since launching our restructuring program in early 2008, we continue to actively manage and review our portfolio to optimize performance in today's volatile consumer spending and commercial real estate market. We ended the quarter with 903 stores, comprised of 283 Ann Taylor stores and 92 Ann Taylor factory stores and 510 Loft stores, plus 18 Loft Outlet stores at the Loft brand.
Moving now to our store square footage, which at the end of the quarter totaled approximately 5.3 million square feet, an approximate 3.5% decrease versus the 5.5 million square feet recorded at the end of the first quarter of 2009. On a weighted average basis, square footage declined 3.3% over the same period. In terms of our strong balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of $207 million, and no bank debt. We generated operating cash flow during the quarter of nearly $14 million, and net cash flow of approximately $3 million. As we've stated previously, we remain committed to using our strong balance sheet and free cash flow to further enhance shareholder value.
Now turning to our outlook for the second quarter and full year 2010. For the second quarter, we expect total net sales to approach $500 million, reflecting double-digit comparable sales performance for the quarter. Gross margin rate performance is expected to be approximately 250 basis points better than the 52.4% level we achieved in the second quarter of 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to be approximately $245 million, which includes approximately $5 million in incremental marketing investment compared to last year's second quarter.
In terms of the full year, our outlook calls for total net sales for the year in the range of $1.95 billion to $1.975 billion, with positive comparable sales at both brands and in all channels in each of the fiscal quarters of 2010. As opposed to our earlier forecast for flat gross margin in fiscal 2010, we now anticipate our gross margin rate performance to be approximately 150 basis points better than the 54.4% level achieved in fiscal 2009. And this improvement is based on favorable sourcing costs and our expectations for higher full price selling.
 
Selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $985 million, reflecting the ongoing benefits of the Company's strategic restructuring program, offset primarily by variable costs associated with higher sales in our existing stores, and incremental investment in marketing as well as operating costs associated with the 30 new stores planned for the back half of 2010. Incremental restructuring savings for the year are expected to total approximately $20 million, and one-time restructuring costs are estimated to be in the range of $2 million to $12 million. Our total weighted average square footage is expected to decline approximately 3% by year end, reflecting the impact of approximately 61 store closures in fiscal 2010, under the Company's previously announced restructuring program, partially offset by the expected opening of approximately 30 new stores, 10 of which will be Loft stores and 20 of which will be Loft Outlet locations to support the continued growth of the Loft brand. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $70 million. And finally, we will continue to focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet and expect a year-end cash position that will exceed our cash position at year-end 2009, and we will maintain our disciplined approach to inventory management throughout the fiscal year.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Kay.

I was wondering if you could give us a little color on your comp guidance by just the stores channel versus the total brand. And then also, we're hearing about a lot about weather related choppiness. Can you give us a sense of where you're tracking in May versus your plan for the quarter?
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
I'll jump in first, Michelle on that. We're pleased with our performance to date. We're positive comping month to date and we're on track to have a good month. Directionally, we're experiencing a trend that's similar to the first quarter with Ann slightly ahead of the Company average. Overall, fashion color and novelty is really what's performing well and as we stated in our release, we're expecting second quarter sales to approach $500 million, with double-digit comps.
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
Michelle, beyond that, we're not going to provide any further specifics with respect to our outlook at the brand or channel level as it relates to Q2 or the full year.

I was wondering if we could get a little bit more color regarding inventory. Again, I know you gave some explanation. I was wondering if we're now at that inflection point you had talked about where we feel good about the products, we really would like to invest and make sure we have the proper in stock and improved Customer Service and, therefore, that's why we're up as we are at AnnTaylor division and whether we could see this kind of level of inventory increase at the end of Q2 and the balance of the second half as well?
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
Sure. I'll be happy to take that. Just to recap briefly, in terms of where we ended the first quarter, again, total Company was down about 2% on a dollars per square foot basis. Ann was up slightly north of 10%. But I think it's important for us to look at the composition of the store  Ann store's channel inventory where their carryover was down about 35% as compared to last year, so the majority of the product that they're carrying into Q2 is extremely fresh and will fuel the anticipated growth that we expect from that brand and that channel as we head into the second quarter. As it relates to Loft, Loft was down low single digits on a dollars per square foot basis, again, composition of Loft's inventory extremely clean. Carryover was about equal to last year but from a composition perspective, about 95% of their inventory was in fact April store set and forward. So we feel very good about the overall level of inventory at the total Company level, as well as our overall level of inventory at the brands.
The other thing I want to highlight is if I look at our inventory position as of the end of the first quarter, as compared to where we've been historically, I think we need to keep in mind that at the end of the first quarter 10 as compared to first quarter 2007, our inventory is down about 30% on a dollars per square foot basis. So as we move forward, we remain committed to being
 
very disciplined in our approach with respect to inventory. But I think the reality is, as we expect this business to grow going forward and to comp positive across the brands and channels, there will be some level of incremental investment as compared to the prior year going forward.
 
 
Betty Chen
- Wedbush Morgan - Analyst
To follow-up with that, Mike, then what should we expect at the end of Q2?
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
At the end of Q2 what I'd say is for the total Company at this point from where I sit I'd expect a mid to high single digit increase.

Our next question from Lorraine Hutchinson, Banc of America, your line is open.

With seeing so much success with the opening price points, can you talk about how you're thinking about pricing going forward for the next few seasons and also as we start to see inflation come in to the sourcing costs, will you expect to raise prices to offset that or I guess just any thoughts on strategy going forward for pricing.
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
Okay. We believe that the first quarter results, especially in AnnTaylor, reflected a much better balance of good, better and best pricing strategy. And as we discussed last quarter, we reduced our spring average initial retail by 15% for the first quarter and for the entire spring season and I think that was very successful for us. We also identified and sourced into key areas such as pants and tops where we recognized the need for more product at opening price points in order for us to be competitive and to appeal to a broader audience in this macro environment. I also want to tell you that we've already affected in the AnnTaylor division our fall 2010 buy and we reduced our average initial retail from 2009 by 18%. So I think for the entire year, and go forward, we are going to offer more compelling price points and a better balance in the AnnTaylor division. In Loft, I think that we absolutely have kept our prices very consistent with the brand expectation and we see no level of change in that division.
 
 
Mike Nicholson -
AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
Lorraine, in terms of product cost, what I'd say is in terms of IMU we expect to deliver improved IMU in 2010, as compared to 2009, despite the headwinds that we see related to both commodity and freight prices as well as declining factory capacity as well as candidly some potential currency pressures. What I would also say is moving forward into 2011, we're committed to protecting the levels that we realized in 2010, and we expect, we fully expect in 2011 that we'll be able to deliver an IMU that is in line with what we anticipate delivering in 2010. In terms of the specific strategies to mitigate this pressure, we continue to rationalize our supply base. We're further consolidating our volume with our strategic suppliers. We're looking at strategies to shift penetration to countries that pose less currency and risk. We're rationalizing our mill base. So as you can see, there are a number of strategies that are under way in the business that give us confidence in 2010 that we will be able to deliver improved IMU as compared to 2009 and as we transition into 2010, we believe that these strategies  into 2011, that these strategies will enable us to anniversary what we expect to deliver in 2010.

I just had one point of clarification regarding the guidance. I wanted to make sure that the $285 million in SG&A guidance did not include the restructuring charges. And then my real question is regarding the e-commerce business, looks like it's about 9% of our total mix. Where do you see that going over time? Do you have a goal there?
 
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
I'll take the SG&A question. For the second quarter, our outlook reflected SG&A of 245, and the 245 excludes the impact of potential restructuring charges.
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
And I would really add on the e-commerce business, it's on fire. It is significantly growing at a very rapid rate and what we are excited about is that we are replatforming this summer and we think that that strategy is going to help us improve that channel even greater. For example, we're adding technology enhancements that will make checkout simpler and quicker so she can add items to her cart, enhance conversion. We're also adding the capability for clients to post reviews and comment on our products. Thus, enhance really client to client sales. We're mobile enabling our sites.
We are adding personalization and segmentation ability to the site which I think is going to be a huge win, huge win for both brands and we're enhancing our international shipping capabilities. We continue to  we had for the first quarter and we continue to focus on expanding online assortment and also online categories, such as weddings and beach and swim and maternity for Loft which I think is going to further propel this business. So, you know, I think that we're in great shape on e-commerce. We continue to think it's a significant driver for us and we're really optimistic about the future.

Kay, clearly, you guys are doing a better job, especially here I'm thinking about the core AnnTaylor division. I'm wondering for fall how we should be thinking about inventory flows. As a shopper I almost had to pull the don't you know I know Kay Krill to get the lace skirt. Are you going to go more in depth in fall for delivery or maybe flow an additional delivery.
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
We're still focused on constant flow, Neely, because she is so responding to fashion and newness and we feel like the more flows we get out there every couple of weeks is really better for us. I think we learned a lot so far this year as to where we need to add depth and where we need to sell out. And you know what, quite honestly, those sellouts are creating demand and buzz and I don't know if you saw but that lace dress was on eBay and sold for three times the amount of what we offered in the store. So that was great PR and buzz for us but we are adding depth behind our marketing looks and key categories and key fashion items that we think she's going to love.

Roxanne Meyer

My question is I mean you've had only two seasons behind you and your results are so impressive knowing you really haven't had much of an opportunity to take your learnings and really apply them to the next season yet. I'm wondering in light of the success you've already had what are the opportunities for fall where you're able to capitalize on some of the learnings since August and then just quickly, secondarily, you alluded to returning cash to shareholders and enhancing value, wondering if you have any buybacks planned and if you could remind us of what you have in mind there and the timing. Thanks.
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
Okay. I'll address our learnings so far. Because it's really  it's different by brand.
In the AnnTaylor brand, I think that definitely the wear to work category has significantly improved for us this quarter, in suiting, in wear to work separates and dresses, and all the tops related to that. We saw tremendous improvement in that category. So she definitely has an appetite for wear to work which as you can imagine we have definitely made sure we have the right inventory, for the remainder of the year in those categories. And as I just said to Neely, we have definitely added depth in the right areas that we know she's responding to also. So we feel great about that.
For the Loft division, she is definitely responding to fashion and newness and print and pattern and novelty, and anything that has got embellishment or novel trends. She is really not responding to basics as much as she had been. So our inventory flow go-forward for the remainder of the year is really focused on fashion and newness and novelty and print and pattern which is really what she has an appetite for so I feel great about the future pipeline of the inventory for the remainder of the year in both brands.
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
Roxanne, to your second question, we remained committed to delivering and creating value for shareholders and we expect to do so in a way that is both prudent and conducive to our long-term success. I'd just remind you that currently we're investing in new, more productive stores. We're focused on building an improved e-commerce channel and we continue to spend on technologies that we believe will enhance our efficiency and productivity longer term. Looking ahead, as we continue to demonstrate momentum in the business, we absolutely will consider other opportunities to deliver and return value to shareholders, and as a reminder, the Company does have approximately $160 million remaining on its previously announced share buyback plan.

Brian Tunick

So huge improvements obviously thus far. The customer obviously loves the merchandise at both brands. How do you guys think about your longer term operating margin goals? Do both businesses  do you need to get AnnTaylor Stores back above $350, $400 a foot in productivity? Does Loft need to be over $450 as well, given your e-commerce penetration, your store rationalization today and the growth of Outlets, and then my second question maybe is as the turnaround's under way, have you completely tabled the new growth concept. I think a year or two ago you talked about one. Or is that something we could hear about again in the next year or so if the continued stabilization continues.
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
I'll take the first part of your question. Our near term or mid-term goal is to get our EBIT margins back to double-digits, say in the 10 to 12% range. And as I look at the business on a total Company basis, we need to focus on a total Company productivity performance that begins to approach $400 a square foot. That is essentially what we are focused on when we talk about enhancing our top line, focus on delivering improvements in overall square foot and productivity, that's the goal the management team is currently focused on.
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
And we are focused  Brian, we are highly focused right now on both of our existing brands, to optimize profitability and growth on those brands right now in all channels, in the store channel and in e-commerce and the Factory channels and that's really where our focus is today. We don't want to be sidetracked.

Katherine Krill

Thank you.
 
 
Jeff Black
- Barclays Capital - Analyst
Mike, on the  just to drill down on the prior question, you know, is that 400 what really unlocks us and gives us the ability to take the SG&A rate back down, sort of underneath the 50 level? I just wonder what kind of spend is really coming back into the business near term and where you see that rate long-term and what's the lever to take it down back closer to historical levels. Thanks.
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
So Jeff, when I say is I'm not in a position to provide you definitive outlook or framework with regard to SG&A rate longer term. What I would say, though, with respect to our outlook for the full year 2010, essentially that suggests a rate that is approximately 50%. So I have confidence in the current year on a rate basis that we will approach 50%, and if you assume growth on top of 2010 and 2011, I see no reason why the next few years that we can't get back to a rate that is more respectable in the low to mid-40s.

You've made great strides with your denim assortments and I wondered how large of an opportunity you think it is from this point, and with the huge trend in khakis and cargoes, skinny cargoes especially, where are you positioned for the fall.
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
As far as denim goes, it's really different by brand. In the AnnTaylor division, we really have to be more polished in darker denim, and work-to-work, denim you would wear to work is really where we win in the AnnTaylor brand. When it's a little more beat up and washed, that really doesn't work as well there. So we feel like we finally figured out what denim needs to be in AnnTaylor and we have that offering flowing through the remainder of the year.
However, in Loft, what really is important is not to have the full denim assortment of bootlegs and everything, it's really about what the fashion is. She is responding right now in Loft to skinny, skinny legs and boyfriend fits. So that's really where we are in multiple washes, as well as denim skirts, denim shorts at all lengths, that's really what's selling and you are absolutely right, cargoes are on fire and we absolutely have those in the pipeline through the remainder of the year, in Loft, from a crop perspective, in the slim leg and in all  and in multiple fabrics because I think that's important too. It's not just a cotton based cargo. So we feel very covered on that.
 
 
Jeff Black
- Barclays Capital - Analyst
What about AnnTaylor for cargoes?
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
We have a more refined one for the back part of the year, let me just say that. Not cotton based.

Our next question comes from Robin Murchison with SunTrust. Your line is open.
 
 
Robin Murchison
- SunTrust - Analyst
thank you very much and good morning. The other thing, the current style events, looks like you're dialing back a little bit on the promotion. I think the Loft this weekend, the e-mail said something like from 11 to 5, so maybe you're going to contain the hours, and then at Ann, buy one, get one 50% off. Can you just comment, are you dialing back a little bit on the promo?
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
Absolutely. And as I said in the  in my remarks, we had a lot of preplanned promotions baked into our expectations for the first quarter, really based on the run rate from the fourth quarter of what we had to do. And we were able to cancel a lot of those. So we are seeing a greater appetite for full price. We definitely will have some promotions baked in the second quarter and pull them if needed. But we absolutely are able to pull back on the overall amount of offers as well as the overall deal. The richness of them. So we're very pleased about that.

Hi.
 
 
Stacy Pak
- SP Research - Analyst
Very, very good. Couple  just one follow-up there on Robin's, just to clarify. You're saying you pulled back on promos in this quarter, not just Q1, so that's number one. Also, can you just say, Mike, explain why is Loft able to deliver double-digit comps on inventories down low singles, but Ann needs inventories up doubles? I'm wondering if you can turn faster and control your risk. And then also, can you just  you guys give the comp metrics by brand? Thanks.
 
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
Stacy, I'm just going to take real quick the promo. What I was referring to is we absolutely were able to pull back on first quarter. We have been able to pull back a little on second quarter. But you know, we're a couple of weeks in, so we'll see how the quarter plays out. But so far, so far, we're positive comping for the month and we're pleased so we were able to pull back on the richness of the order, of the promotion, which I think is important.
 
 
Stacy Pak
- SP Research - Analyst
Great.
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
To answer your other two questions, just in terms of the Loft comp performance, I want to clarify. Our perspective on comps for the second quarter was a total Company perspective, so first let me provide that clarification. Then I would also say as it relates to Loft's comp performance in Q1, on inventory that finished the quarter down a low single digit, it was really a function of improved full priced selling, better product, and quite frankly, timing of receipts and as we move, transition into the second quarter, we will actually begin to see Loft's inventory better aligned to the comp trend of the business. In terms of your question on comp metrics, what I'll do is just provide you some perspective on the store channel metrics. So within AnnTaylor, the comp as we mentioned and reported in our release today for the quarter was up about 15%. Traffic was up a mid single digit positive with transactions also up to the same degree. And then a big driver of Ann's 15% comp performance in that channel was DPT, and it was really driven by a significant increase year on year in AUR. As it relates to Loft, Loft's comp performance, very healthy traffic, traffic that approached 10% growth versus last year, a similar corresponding growth year on year in terms of transactions. And DPT was essentially flat within the Loft store's channel for the first quarter.
 
 
Stacy Pak

And just to follow up there, Mike, is there opportunity to do better on the  (multiple speakers)
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
Go ahead.
 
 
Stacy Pak
- SP Research - Analyst
I'm just asking on the inventory, is there opportunity to do better on the inventory turns so that you don't need inventory up as much to drive comps?
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
What I say is that we believe it's prudent to invest to support growth going forward. We will continue to do it in a measured, prudent fashion. And at the same time, we are focused on improving turns. We're exploring opportunities to hold and flow. All of that is on the table and our goal longer term is to improve turns, but also we want to be mindful that it's important to fuel the top line growth for the business.
 
 
 
Katherine Krill
- AnnTaylor Stores - President, CEO
And Stacy, I'm going to add one more thing and then we need to move on. We also have recently improved our ability to chase product and Loft specifically, we're chasing a lot in 12 weeks and under and that is chasing back obviously to best sellers so there is not risk there. So we've got multiple levers that we're pushing right now.

I guess a question for Mike. Should AnnTaylor and Loft deliver similar operating margins over time, this is as you head towards 2010, theoretically could they do that and should direct to consumer be higher and could you give us an idea of sort of what you're thinking the magnitude of margins in direct would be.
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
Barbara, what I'd say is we don't disclose and we don't provide a forward-looking perspective on bottom line operating margins by brand or channel. In terms of E-com, what I'd say is sitting here today, longer term I think the management believes that a goal of doubling the business, doubling the business for the E-com business is a very achievable goal for the corporation.

As you think about the gross margin and the opportunities there, how do you see the come complexion of it going forward? Is merchandise margin an opportunity? Product cost? S and what do you see in inflationary pressure for the balance of 2010 and 2011.
 
 
Mike Nicholson
- AnnTaylor Stores - EVP, CFO
I guess I would reiterate what I said previously regarding IMU. In 2010, we do expect to deliver an improved IMU off of 2009. We recognize that there is significant headwinds out there but we've got a number of strategies under way in the supply chain arena that we believe will help us mitigate the pressure of cost as we transition from 2010 into 2011. Again, in terms of longer term goal, let me step back for a moment. In terms of 2010, our overall perspective with respect to gross margin, we anticipate being able to deliver about 150 basis points in improvement in gross margin in 2010 off of 2009. Longer term, within the business, we have a goal to longer-term, head towards 60%.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal second quarter ended July 31, 2010, and commented on its outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year 2010.
New York, NY, August 20, 2010
For the second quarter of 2010, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.32, excluding after-tax restructuring charges totaling approximately $0.01 per share, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.06 in the second quarter of 2009, excluding after-tax restructuring charges totaling $0.38 per share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring charges, earnings per diluted share were $0.31 in the second quarter of 2010, compared with a loss per diluted share of ($0.32) in the second quarter of 2009.
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "The Company generated substantially stronger earnings for the second quarter, including a more than fivefold increase in operating profit, excluding restructuring charges, when compared with the second quarter of 2009. Significantly higher sales and gross margin rate at the Ann Taylor brand drove the increase.
"Specifically, the Ann Taylor brand delivered an excellent quarter as momentum continued to build since the brand's evolution began in Fall 2009. Comparable sales at the brand of more than 15%  including approximately 20% at Ann Taylor stores  underscore the strong client response to our product and the positive impact of our marketing initiatives. The brand continues to perform extremely well as we enter the third quarter. At the LOFT brand, results were mixed, reflecting some sales softness in the stores channel related to select product categories. LOFT's e-commerce and outlet channels, however, delivered very strong top-line performance, and all channels at the brand delivered solid gross margin results. Importantly, both Ann Taylor and LOFT have entered the third quarter with clean inventories at levels that, we believe, position the Company for profitable top-line growth."
In commenting on the Company's financial strength, Ms. Krill noted that the Company ended the fiscal second quarter with cash on hand of more than $260 million, approximately double the cash excluding the revolver, that it had at the same period last year. The Company has no bank debt. "We remain firmly committed to using our strong balance sheet and free cash flow to further enhance shareholder value and, as such, I am pleased to report that our Board has voted to expand our existing share repurchase authorization to $400 million, resulting in nearly $260 million currently available under the authorization to repurchase our shares," she said.
Total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2010 were $483.5 million, compared with net sales of $470.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $207.2 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with net sales of $191.8 million in the second quarter of 2009. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $276.2 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with net sales of $278.4 million in the second quarter of 2009.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 6.1%, versus a decline of 22.4% in the prior year. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 15.2%, reflecting increases of 19.6% at Ann Taylor stores, 28.5% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 6.3% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales were flat, reflecting a decrease of 3.1% at LOFT stores that was offset by an increase of 54.6% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and a 13.2% increase in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 55.0%, reflecting a 260 basis point improvement over the 52.4% gross margin rate achieved in the second quarter of 2009. This record second quarter gross margin rate performance was primarily driven by improved product offerings and higher full-price selling at the Ann Taylor brand, effective marketing initiatives and the success of the Company's strategy to appropriately position inventory levels.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2010 were $235.4 million, versus $240.2 million in the second quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting payroll, benefits and tenancy-related savings associated with the Company's restructuring program and continued stringent expense management, partially offset by incremental marketing investment versus the second quarter of 2009.
During the quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.8 million associated with its previously announced strategic restructuring program, compared with $31.1 million in the second quarter of 2009. On an after-tax basis, second quarter 2010 restructuring charges totaled $0.5 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share, compared with $21.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009.
Excluding restructuring charges, the Company reported operating income of $30.7 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $6.0 million in the second quarter of 2009. On the same basis, the Company reported net income in the quarter of $19.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared with net income of $3.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported operating income of $29.9 million in the second quarter of 2010, compared with an operating loss of ($25.2) million in the second quarter of 2009. On the same basis, the Company reported net income of $18.6 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2010, compared with a net loss of ($18.0) million, or ($0.32) per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009.
The Company closed the quarter with approximately $263 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, at the end of the second quarter increased 8.3% versus year-ago, reflecting a 25.2% increase at Ann Taylor stores and a 1.9% increase at LOFT stores, while our factory/outlet channel was essentially flat. The increase at Ann Taylor stores reflects earlier receipt of the full complement of the brand's seasonal core wardrobe essentials versus last year, without which, inventory per square foot at Ann Taylor stores would have increased approximately 10%.
During the second quarter of 2010, the Ann Taylor brand closed four Ann Taylor stores and converted one Ann Taylor store to a LOFT store. At the LOFT brand, the Company closed five LOFT stores. The Company did not open any new stores during the quarter. The total store count at the end of the second quarter was 894, comprised of 278 Ann Taylor stores, 92 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 506 LOFT stores, and 18 LOFT Outlet stores. The Company updated expectations related to the store closure component of its previously announced strategic restructuring program. Under the program, the Company now expects to close approximately 56 stores in fiscal 2010, bringing the total closures associated with the three-year program to approximately 158. Of these, approximately half are expected to be Ann Taylor stores and half are expected to be LOFT stores.
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2010 were $959.7 million, compared with net sales of $897 million in the first half of fiscal 2009. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand were $405.6 million in the first half of 2010, compared with net sales of $370.1 million in the first half of 2009. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $554.1 million in the first half of 2010, compared with net sales of $526.9 million in the first half of 2009.
Total Company comparable sales for the first half of 2010 increased 9.9%, versus a decline of 26.3% in the prior year. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 15.8%, including increases of 17.3% at Ann Taylor stores, 39.8% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 8.3% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales increased by 5.9%, including an increase of 2.7% at LOFT stores, an increase of 57.5% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and a 17.8% increase in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 57.2%, reflecting a 330 basis point improvement over the 53.9% gross margin rate achieved in the first half of 2009. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first half of 2010 were $479.2 million, versus $478.8 million in the first half of 2009, primarily reflecting higher marketing and performance-based compensation costs and an increase in variable costs related to higher sales, partially offset by restructuring program savings.
During the first six months of 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $1.1 million, compared with $32.1 million in the first six months of 2009. On an after- tax basis, restructuring charges totaled $0.7 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2010, compared with restructuring charges of $22.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2009.
Excluding restructuring charges, the Company reported operating income of $69.7 million for the first half of 2010, compared with operating income of $4.2 million in the first half of 2009. On the same basis, the Company reported net income in the first half of 2010 of $41.9 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.1 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the first half of 2009.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported operating income of $68.6 million in the first half of 2010, compared with an operating loss of ($27.9) million in the first half of 2009. On the same basis, the Company reported net income of $41.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the first half of 2010, compared with a net loss of ($20.3) million, or ($0.36) per diluted share, in the first half of 2009.
For the fiscal third quarter of 2010, the Company expects total net sales to approach $495 million, reflecting mid- to high-single digit comparable sales performance at the Company, including a strong double-digit comparable sales increase at the Ann Taylor brand and a low single-digit comparable sales increase at the LOFT brand. Gross margin rate performance is expected to be slightly better than 56%. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to be $245 million, including approximately $5 million in incremental marketing investment versus last year. In terms of the full year, the Company updated its outlook as follows:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal third quarter ended October 30, 2010, and commented on its outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2010.
New York, NY, November 19, 2010
For the third quarter of 2010, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.42, excluding after-tax restructuring charges totaling $0.01 per diluted share, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.20 in the third quarter of 2009, excluding after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling $0.17 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned charges, earnings per diluted share were $0.41 in the third quarter of 2010, compared with $0.03 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009.
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are extremely pleased with the Company's excellent performance for the third quarter of 2010, with earnings for the quarter more than doubling from the year-ago period. The significantly higher sales and near-record gross margin rate reflect another standout quarter at the Ann Taylor brand and improved results at the LOFT brand for the third quarter.
"The Ann Taylor brand delivered meaningful gains across all of its channels, resulting in a 22% comparable sales increase for the brand. We continue to see an enthusiastic client response to the compelling fashion, quality and value Ann Taylor offers and are capturing a greater share of her overall spend. The LOFT brand also showed progress during the quarter, with outstanding performance in the online and outlet channels and steady improvement in the stores channel, which, as expected, delivered stronger sales in September and October as we received new product.
"While we anticipate a promotional environment in the upcoming months, we feel good about our overall business as we enter the fourth quarter and believe we are well-positioned in terms of our product, inventories, marketing initiatives and our planned promotional strategies for the Holiday season," Ms. Krill said.
Total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2010 were $505.3 million, compared with net sales of $462.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $223.2 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with net sales of $195.0 million in the third quarter of 2009. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $282.1 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with net sales of $267.4 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 11.7%, versus a decline of 13.0% in the prior year. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 21.9%, reflecting increases of 23.4% at Ann Taylor stores, 57.0% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 11.3% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales were up 4.5%, reflecting a decrease of 0.6% at LOFT stores, which was more than offset by an increase of 64.6% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and a 22.0% increase in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 57.2%, compared to the 57.3% gross margin rate achieved in the third quarter of 2009. This strong third quarter gross margin rate performance was primarily driven by improved product offerings and higher full-price selling at the Ann Taylor brand, effective marketing initiatives and the success of the Company's strategy to appropriately position inventory levels at both brands.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2010 were essentially flat at $247.4 million, versus $246.2 million in the third quarter of 2009, on a $43 million increase in sales.
During the quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.6 million associated with its previously announced strategic restructuring program, compared with $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2009. On an after-tax basis, third quarter 2010 restructuring charges totaled $0.3 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share, compared with $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009.
The Company did not have any non-cash asset impairment charges related to stores not included in the Company's restructuring program, compared to pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges totaling $15.3 million in the third quarter of 2009. On an after-tax basis, third quarter 2009 asset impairment charges totaled $10.2 million, or $0.16 per diluted share.
Excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges, the Company reported operating income of $41.4 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $18.7 million in the third quarter of 2009. On the same basis, the Company reported net income in the quarter of $24.5 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared with net income of $12.0 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009.
On a GAAP basis, the Company reported operating income of $40.8 million in the third quarter of 2010, compared with an operating income of $2.7 million in the third quarter of 2009. On the same basis, the Company reported net income of $24.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2010, compared with a net income of $2.1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2009.
The Company closed the quarter with approximately $224 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the fiscal third quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock at an approximate cost of $19.8 million.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, at the end of the third quarter increased eight percent versus year-ago, reflecting a 16% increase at Ann Taylor stores, a one percent increase at LOFT stores, and an 18% increase in the factory outlet channel to support new LOFT Outlet stores.
During the third quarter of 2010, the Ann Taylor brand closed two Ann Taylor stores. At the LOFT brand, the Company closed one LOFT store and converted four LOFT stores to LOFT Outlet stores. The Company opened five new LOFT stores and 11 new LOFT Outlet stores during the quarter. The total store count at the end of the third quarter was 907, comprised of 276 Ann Taylor stores, 92 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 506 LOFT stores, and 33 LOFT Outlet stores. The Company updated expectations related to the store closure component of its previously announced strategic restructuring program. Under the program, the Company now expects to close approximately 43 stores in fiscal 2010, bringing the total closures associated with the three-year program to approximately 145. Of these, approximately half are expected to be Ann Taylor stores and half are expected to be LOFT stores.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2010 were $1.5 billion, compared with net sales of $1.4 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2009. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand were $628.8 million in the first nine months of 2010, compared with net sales of $565.1 million in the first nine months of 2009. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $836.1 million in the first nine months of 2010, compared with net sales of $794.3 million in the first nine months of 2009.
Total Company comparable sales for the first nine months of 2010 increased 10.5%, versus a decline of 22.2% in the prior year.

(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2010 were $726.6 million, versus $725.0 million in the first nine months of 2009.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 Ann Taylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today announced that, based upon stronger than anticipated fourth quarter sales, including positive comparable sales at both the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands, the Company expects to report top-line and bottom-line results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010 that will exceed the current consensus of analyst expectations and be substantially higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. The Company also expects to report substantially stronger sales and earnings for fiscal year 2010 over fiscal year 2009.
New York, NY, February 2, 2011

Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance, driven by stronger-than-anticipated sales. Importantly, we generated positive comparable sales at both brands in each month of the quarter. The higher sales performance more than offset the impact of several significant weather events as well as margin pressure at LOFT and enabled us to deliver strong bottom line results and a clean inventory position at the end of the quarter. Overall, the quarter represented a solid finish to a strong fiscal 2010, with sales and earnings for the year that are substantially higher than fiscal 2009 levels."

The Company is providing operating income, net income and earnings per share data for the quarters and years ended January 29, 2011 and January 30, 2010 that exclude costs associated with the Company's previously-announced restructuring program and, for the year ended January 30, 2010, asset impairment charges.

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 AnnTaylor Stores Corporation (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2010, ended January 29, 2011, and provided an outlook for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2011.
New York, NY, March 11, 2011
For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2010, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.19, excluding after-tax restructuring charges of $0.05 per diluted share, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.05 in the fourth quarter of 2009, excluding after-tax restructuring charges totaling $0.05 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring charges, earnings per diluted share were $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with breakeven earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009.
For the full year of fiscal 2010, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $1.30, excluding after-tax restructuring charges of $0.06 per diluted share, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.32 in the full year of fiscal 2009, excluding after-tax restructuring and asset impairment charges totaling $0.64 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned restructuring and asset impairment charges, earnings per diluted share were $1.24 in fiscal 2010, compared with a net loss per diluted share of $0.32 in fiscal 2009.
Kay Krill, President and CEO, commented, "Our strong performance in the fourth quarter capped off an excellent year for our Company. For both the quarter and the fiscal year, we achieved substantial increases in sales and profitability, while positioning both the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands for continued growth. We delivered an 11 percent comparable sales increase for the quarter, with both brands achieving positive comparable sales performance. In fact, the Company achieved positive comparable sales in every quarter of fiscal 2010. For the quarter, diluted EPS before charges was up almost fourfold from the prior year's fourth quarter and, for the full year, diluted EPS before charges increased by nearly $1.00 per share from the $0.32 reported in fiscal 2009.
"We have also delivered on our commitment to further enhance shareholder value through the repurchase of 4.2 million shares at a total cost of $100 million in 2010 and, during the first quarter of 2011, we have repurchased an additional 4.2 million shares at a cost of $100 million. I am also pleased that our Board has voted to expand our share repurchase program by an additional $200 million, giving us nearly $260 million available for repurchase under the authorization."
"As we look to fiscal 2011, we are excited about the potential to build on our momentum. Our talented and experienced team is moving forward strategically to capitalize on the opportunities across our multiple channels, with a focus on delivering continued sales and profit growth while maintaining our exceptionally strong balance sheet.
"Finally, I am pleased to announce today that, in order to better reflect the multi-channel focus we have on our business, we have decided to change our corporate name from Ann Taylor Stores Corporation to ANN INC. Today, our Company is far more than a traditional store-based' retailer. We have two distinct brands  Ann Taylor and LOFT  each of which operates across three channels and enables us to reach our client whether she is making her purchases at our stores, online or at our factory outlet locations." stated Ms. Krill.
Total net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were $515.3 million, compared with net sales of $469.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $234.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with net sales of $206.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $280.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with net sales of $263.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 11.0% versus the fourth quarter of 2009. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 20.9%, reflecting increases of 19.1% at Ann Taylor stores, 74.3% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 9.2% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales were up 3.5%, reflecting a decrease of 3.2% at LOFT stores, which was more than offset by increases of 77.2% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and 26.9% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 51.7%, versus the 52.5% gross margin rate achieved in the fourth quarter of 2009. This solid gross margin performance reflected strong product performance at the Ann Taylor brand and conservative inventory positions at both brands, offset by a higher level of promotional activity at the LOFT brand during the quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2010 were $252.0 million versus $241.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 260 basis points versus the prior year to 48.9%. This decline in expenses as a percentage of net sales reflected substantially higher
net sales, restructuring program savings, and continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by higher marketing investment and performance-based compensation costs as well as an increase in variable costs related to higher sales versus the 2009 period.
During the quarter, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $3.9 million associated with its previously announced strategic restructuring program, compared with $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. On an after-tax basis, fourth quarter 2010 restructuring charges totaled $3.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with $2.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Excluding the aforementioned charges, the Company reported operating income of $14.3 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. On the same basis, the Company reported net income in the quarter of $11.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.5 million, or $0.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009. On a GAAP basis, the Company reported operating income of $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with operating income of $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. On the same basis, the Company reported net income of $8.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with net income and diluted earnings per share that were approximately breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2009.
During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company opened eight new stores, comprised of five LOFT stores and three LOFT Outlet stores, and closed 10 Ann Taylor stores and nine LOFT stores.
Total net sales for the full year of fiscal 2010 were nearly $2 billion, compared with net sales of $1.8 billion in the full year of fiscal 2009. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $863.7 million in fiscal 2010, compared with net sales of $771.3 million in fiscal 2009. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $1,116.5 million in 2010, compared with net sales of $1,057.2 million in 2009.
Total Company comparable sales for fiscal 2010 increased 10.7% versus the prior year. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 18.7%, reflecting increases of 19.3% at Ann Taylor stores, 54.3% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 9.3% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales were up 5.0%, reflecting increases of 0.5% at LOFT stores, 65.3% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and 21.2% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was a record 55.8% in fiscal 2010, an increase of 140 basis points compared to fiscal 2009.
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $978.6 million versus $966.6 million in fiscal 2009. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 350 basis points versus the prior year to 49.4%.
During fiscal 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $5.6 million, compared with pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $36.4 million in fiscal 2009. On an after-tax basis, restructuring charges totaled $3.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010 compared with $25.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in fiscal 2009.
During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash asset impairment charges totaling $15.3 million related to stores not included in the Company's restructuring program. On an after-tax basis, these fiscal 2009 asset impairment charges totaled $10.7 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. There were no such asset impairment charges in fiscal 2010.
Excluding the aforementioned pre-tax restructuring charges and, for fiscal 2009, the asset impairment charges, operating income for the full year of fiscal 2010 was $125.4 million, compared with operating income of $27.7 million in 2009. On a GAAP basis, the Company reported operating income of $119.8 million in 2010, compared with an operating loss of $24.0 million in 2009.
Net income, excluding the aforementioned after-tax restructuring and, for fiscal 2009, asset impairment charges, totaled $76.9 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, for the full year of fiscal 2010, compared with net income of $17.8 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in 2009. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned charges, net income for 2010 was $73.4 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $18.2 million, or $0.32 per diluted share in 2009.
The Company ended the year with approximately $227 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, at the end of fiscal 2010 increased 14%, in line with our comparable sales performance and reflected incremental inventory to support our plans to open 44 factory outlet stores in the first half of fiscal 2011. Inventory per square foot increased 24% at Ann Taylor stores and 1% at LOFT stores.
During fiscal 2010, the Company opened 24 stores, comprised of 10 LOFT stores and 14 LOFT Outlet stores and closed 35 stores, comprised of 19 Ann Taylor stores and 16 LOFT stores. In addition, the Company converted six Ann Taylor stores to LOFT stores and four LOFT stores to LOFT Outlet stores. The total store count at the end of the fiscal year was 896, comprised of 266 Ann Taylor stores, 502 LOFT stores, 92 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 36 LOFT Outlet stores.
During fiscal 2010, the Company completed its 3-year Strategic Restructuring Program, which was launched in January 2008. The Company achieved its goal under the Program to generate total ongoing annualized savings of approximately $125 million, of which approximately $90 million represents SG&A savings and the remaining $35 million represents gross margin savings.
Total pre-tax expenses associated with our restructuring initiatives were $134.0 million, of which $84.2 million were non-cash expenses, primarily associated with the write-down of assets related to store closures, and $49.8 million were cash charges for severance and various other costs. In fiscal 2010, the Company recorded $5.6 million in pre-tax restructuring charges. In fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, the Company recorded $36.4 million, $59.7 million and $32.3 million, respectively, in pre-tax restructuring charges.
Under the program, the Company closed 60 stores in fiscal 2008, 42 stores in fiscal 2009, and 35 stores in fiscal 2010, for a total of 137 store closures under the 3-year program. Of these, approximately half were Ann Taylor stores and half were LOFT stores.
For the fiscal first quarter of 2011, the Company expects total net sales to approach $510 million, reflecting a total Company comparable sales increase in the mid-to-high single digits. Gross margin rate performance is expected to be approximately 58.5%. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to be approximately $255 million, reflecting support for the Company's strategic growth initiative to accelerate factory outlet expansion in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as the first quarter 2011 impact of 18 new LOFT outlet stores opened in the second half of fiscal 2010.
In terms of the full year, the Company provided the following outlook:

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
Section 1. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings other Than Those by or in the Right of the Corporation
nolo contendere
. Subject to Section 3 of this Article VIII, the Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
Section 2. Power to Indemnify in Actions, Suits or Proceedings by or in the Right of the Corporation
 
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.
. Any indemnification under this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director or officer is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 1 or Section 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director or officer of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.
Section 3. Authorization of Indemnification
. For purposes of any determination under Section 3 of this Article VIII, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another enterprise" as used in this Section 4 shall mean any other corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this Section 4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive
Section 4. Good Faith Defined
 
or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be.
. Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII, and notwithstanding the absence of any determination thereunder, any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a determination by such court that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII, as the case may be. Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 3 of this Article VIII nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a defense to such application or create a presumption that the director or officer seeking indemnification has not met any applicable standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to this Section 5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director or officer seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such application.
Section 5. Indemnification by a Court
. Expenses incurred by a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in defending or investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this Article VIII.
Section 6. Expenses Payable in Advance
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the persons specified in Sections 1 and 2 of this Article VIII shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article VIII shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in Sections 1 or 2 of this Article VIII but whom the Corporation has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.
Section 7. Nonexclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a
Section 8. Insurance
 
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.
. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Article VIII, references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director or officer of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Article VIII.
Section 9. Certain Definitions
. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
Section 10. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses
. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article VIII to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by Section 5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Section 11. Limitation on Indemnification
. The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to those conferred in this Article VIII to directors and officers of the Corporation.
Section 12. Indemnification of Employees and Agents
 
These Bylaws may be altered, amended or repealed, in whole or in part, or new Bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that notice of such alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption of new Bylaws be contained in the notice of such meeting of stockholders or Board of Directors as the case may be. All such amendments must be approved by either the holders of a majority of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in office. Any alteration, amendment or repeal of Article VIII of these Bylaws shall not adversely affect any rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses of a person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such alteration, amendment or repeal with respect to any acts or omissions occurring prior to such alteration, amendment or repeal.
Section 1.

ANN INC. (the "Company") issued a Press Release, dated May 20, 2011. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal first quarter of 2011, ended April 30, 2011. The Company also provided its outlook for the second quarter of 2011 and increased its outlook for the full year.
New York, NY, May 20, 2011
For the fiscal first quarter of 2011, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.51, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.38 in the first quarter of 2010.
Kay Krill, President and CEO, commented, "ANN INC. delivered a very strong first quarter performance, achieving significant double-digit growth in sales, earnings and earnings per share. We are particularly gratified that this performance came on top of very strong results in last year's first quarter, as comparable sales for the Company rose 8% on top of last year's 14% increase, with both the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands delivering positive comparable sales.
"Looking ahead, and coming off of a very strong April in both brands, we fully expect to deliver positive comparable sales performance in both brands and across all channels for the second quarter. We are also well-positioned to achieve continued profitable growth in 2011 and beyond."
Total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 were $523.6 million, compared with net sales of $476.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $222.9 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with net sales of $198.4 million in the first quarter of 2010. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels totaled $300.8 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with net sales of $277.8 million in the first quarter of 2010.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 7.8% versus the first quarter of 2010. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 15.3%, reflecting increases of 13.7% at Ann Taylor stores, 43.1% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 9.2% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales were up 2.4%, reflecting a slight decrease of 1.0% at LOFT stores, which was more than offset by increases of 32.8% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and 15.7% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 57.3%, versus the record 59.4% gross margin rate achieved in the first quarter of 2010. The strong gross margin performance in the first quarter of 2011 reflected solid product execution at both brands, offset by a promotional strategy to drive traffic and mitigate the combined impact of an unseasonably cool Spring, a very late Easter holiday and a highly competitive promotional environment.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2011 were $254.0 million versus $243.8 million reported in the first quarter of 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 270 basis points versus the prior year to 48.5%. This decline in expenses as a percentage of net sales reflected substantially higher net sales and continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by costs associated with the Company's accelerated factory outlet strategy as well as an increase in variable costs associated with higher sales versus the 2010 period.
The Company reported operating income of $45.9 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $38.7 million in the first quarter of 2010. Net income for the first quarter was $27.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, compared with net income of $22.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2010.
The Company ended the quarter with approximately $104 million in cash and cash equivalents, following the previously-reported repurchase of approximately 4.2 million shares totaling $100 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2011.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2011 increased 9%, in line with our comparable sales performance, and reflected incremental inventory to support the opening of 44 factory outlet stores in the first half of fiscal 2011. Inventory per square foot increased 20% at Ann Taylor stores and declined 6% at LOFT stores.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company opened 32 stores, comprised of three LOFT stores, 25 LOFT Outlet stores, and four Ann Taylor Factory stores. During the quarter, the company closed five LOFT stores. The total store count at the end of the fiscal first quarter was 923, comprised of 266 Ann Taylor stores, 500 LOFT stores, 96 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 61 LOFT Outlet stores.
For the fiscal second quarter of 2011, the Company expects total net sales to be $550 million, reflecting a total Company comparable sales increase in the mid-single digits. Gross margin rate performance is expected to be approximately 55.5%. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to be $265 million, with the increase versus last year primarily reflecting support for the Company's strategic growth initiative to accelerate factory outlet expansion in the first half of fiscal 2011, as well as the second quarter 2011 impact of 18 new LOFT outlet stores opened in the second half of fiscal 2010. Earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of 2011 is anticipated to be slightly higher than the current consensus of analyst expectations.
In terms of fiscal 2011, the Company increased its expectations for the year, as follows:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal second quarter of 2011, ended July 30, 2011. The Company also provided its outlook for the third quarter and full year of fiscal 2011.
New York, NY, August 19, 2011
For the fiscal second quarter of 2011, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.47, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.31 in the second quarter of 2010.
Kay Krill, President and CEO, commented, "With our second quarter results, ANN INC. delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in earnings and diluted earnings per share. Our results reflect strong performance at the LOFT brand across all channels for the quarter, as clients responded to the assortment of feminine basics and fashion at great value. We also delivered solid results in the Ann Taylor brand, with strong performance in the e-commerce and factory channels and positive, but softer-than-expected, performance in the stores channel.
"During the second quarter, we continued to expand our presence in highly profitable channels through the addition of 12 factory outlet stores and the successful transition of both brands to a new e-commerce platform, which will enable accelerated growth in this important channel. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we are pleased by client response to our new pre-Fall product assortments, and we fully expect to deliver positive comparable sales performance at both brands in all channels."
Total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2011 were $558.2 million, compared with net sales of $483.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $217.9 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared with net sales of $207.2 million in the second quarter of 2010. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels totaled $340.3 million in the second quarter of 2011, compared with net sales of $276.2 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 8.6% versus the second quarter of 2010. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 5.3%, reflecting increases of 0.6% at Ann Taylor stores, 32.0% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 6.5% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales were up 11.0%, reflecting increases of 8.6% at LOFT stores, 33.5% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and 23.7% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 55.0%, equivalent to the record gross margin rate achieved in the second quarter of 2010. The strong gross margin performance in the second quarter of 2011 reflected excellent product execution and lower promotional activity at LOFT stores, and a higher promotional cadence at Ann Taylor stores to move through select Summer product that did not resonate with our client.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2011 were $265.1 million versus $235.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 120 basis points versus the prior year to 47.5%. The improvement in SG&A rate reflected substantially higher net sales and continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by costs associated with the Company's accelerated factory outlet strategy, an increase in variable costs associated with higher sales versus the 2010 period and higher performance-based compensation expense.
During the second quarter of 2011, the Company did not incur any pre-tax restructuring charges, but did record pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.8 million in the second quarter of 2010. On an after-tax basis, these second quarter 2010 charges totaled $0.5 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share.
The Company reported operating income of $41.7 million in the second quarter of 2011, an increase of 39% compared with operating income of $29.9 million in the second quarter of 2010. Net income was $24.8 million in the second quarter of 2011, an increase of 33% versus the $18.6 million reported in the second quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per share were $0.47, an increase of 52% compared to the $0.31 per diluted share reported in the second quarter of 2010.
The Company ended the quarter with approximately $145 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2011 increased 9%, reflecting an 8% increase at Ann Taylor stores, a 3% increase at LOFT stores and an increase in the factory outlet channel in the mid-teens.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, the Company opened 24 stores, comprised of seven Ann Taylor stores, one Ann Taylor Factory store, five LOFT stores and 11 LOFT Outlet stores. During the quarter, the company closed four LOFT stores and one Ann Taylor store. The total store count at the end of the fiscal second quarter was 942,
comprised of 272 Ann Taylor stores, 97 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 501 LOFT stores, and 72 LOFT Outlet stores.
Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2011 were $1,081.8 million, compared with net sales of $959.7 million in the first half of fiscal 2010. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand were $440.8 million in the first half of 2011, compared with net sales of $405.6 million in the first half of 2010. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $641.1 million in the first half of 2011, compared with net sales of $554.1 million in the first half of 2010.
Total Company comparable sales for the first half of 2011 increased 8.2%, on top of an increase of 9.9% in the prior year. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 10.2%, including increases of 7.0% at Ann Taylor stores, 38.1% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 7.8% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales increased by 6.7%, including an increase of 3.8% at LOFT stores, an increase of 33.1% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and a 20.0% increase in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 56.1% in the first half of 2011.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first half of 2011 were $519.2 million, versus $479.2 million in the first half of 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 190 basis points versus the prior year to 48.0%. The improvement in the SG&A rate reflected substantially higher net sales and continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by costs associated with the Company's accelerated factory outlet strategy and an increase in variable costs associated with higher sales versus the 2010 period.
During the first six months of 2011, the Company did not record any restructuring charges, compared with pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $1.1 million recorded in the first six months of 2010. On an after-tax basis, restructuring charges totaled $0.7 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the first six months of 2010.
The Company reported operating income of $87.6 million in the first half of 2011, an increase of 28% compared with operating income of $68.6 million in the first half of 2010. Net income was $52.1 million in the first half of 2011, an increase of 26% versus the $41.2 million reported in the first half of 2010. Diluted earnings per share in the first half of 2011 were $0.97 per diluted share, an increase of 41% over the $0.69 per diluted share reported in the first half of 2010.
For the fiscal third quarter of 2011, the Company expects total net sales to be $565 million, reflecting a total Company comparable sales increase in the mid-single digits. Gross margin rate performance is expected to be slightly better than last year's performance of 57.2%. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to approach $275 million, with the increase versus last year primarily reflecting support for the Company's strategic growth initiative to accelerate factory outlet expansion, an increased investment in marketing compared to the third quarter of 2010 and higher variable store operating costs to support planned top-line growth.
In terms of the full year, the Company has updated its outlook for fiscal 2011, as follows:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal third quarter of 2011, ended October 29, 2011. The Company also provided its outlook for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2011.
New York, NY, November 18, 2011
For the fiscal third quarter of 2011, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.61, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.41 in the third quarter of 2010.
Kay Krill, President and CEO commented, "ANN INC. delivered another outstanding quarter, generating our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth and our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in earnings and diluted earnings per share. Looking ahead to the balance of the fiscal year, we are on track to achieve another year of significant growth in sales and earnings.
"By brand, LOFT generated exceptional results, as compelling product and effective marketing drove significantly higher sales and profitability across all LOFT channels. The Ann Taylor brand delivered solid performance, reflecting outstanding results in the e-commerce channel, solid performance in the factory channel and softer-than-expected sales in the stores channel."
Total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2011 were $564.0 million, compared with net sales of $505.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2010. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $229.7 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with net sales of $223.2 million in the third quarter of 2010. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $334.3 million in the third quarter of 2011, compared with net sales of $282.1 million in the third quarter of 2010.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.5%, on top of an increase of 11.7% in the prior year. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 2.5%, reflecting a decline of 5.8% at Ann Taylor stores, and increases of 45.8% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 1.8% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales were up 7.9%, reflecting increases of 5.9% at LOFT stores, 23.0% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and 10.9% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 57.5%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the 57.2% gross margin rate achieved in the third quarter of 2010. Our strong third quarter gross margin performance was primarily driven by improved product offerings and higher full-price selling at the LOFT brand, as well as the benefits realized from growth in the e-commerce and factory/outlet channels since the third quarter of 2010.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2011 were $269.5 million, up 9% from $247.4 million in the third quarter of 2010, on a 12% increase in net sales. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 120 basis points to 47.8%, versus the prior year period. This improvement in SG&A rate reflected substantially higher net sales and continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by costs associated with the Company's accelerated factory outlet strategy and an increase in variable costs associated with higher sales versus the 2010 period.
During the third quarter of 2011, the Company did not incur any pre-tax restructuring charges, but did record pre-tax restructuring charges of $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2010. On an after-tax basis, these third quarter 2010 charges totaled $0.3 million, or approximately $0.01 per diluted share.
The Company reported operating income of $54.7 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 34.0% compared with operating income of $40.8 million in the third quarter of 2010. Net income was $32.3 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 33.4% versus the $24.2 million reported in the third quarter of 2010. Diluted earnings per share were $0.61, an increase of 48.8% compared to the $0.41 per diluted share reported in the third quarter of 2010.
The Company ended the quarter with approximately $140 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, at the end of the third quarter was up 11% versus year-ago, reflecting increases of approximately 8% at Ann Taylor stores, 13% at LOFT stores and 10% in the factory outlet channel.
During the third quarter of 2011, the Company opened six new Ann Taylor stores, four new LOFT stores and two new LOFT Outlet stores. The Company also closed two Ann Taylor stores and two LOFT stores. The total store count at the end of the third quarter was 950, comprised of 276 Ann Taylor stores, 97 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 503 LOFT stores, and 74 LOFT Outlet stores.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2011 were $1.6 billion, compared with net sales of $1.5 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2010. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand were $670.5 million in the first nine months of 2011, compared with net sales of $628.8 million in the first nine months of 2010. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $975.3 million in the first nine months of 2011, compared with net sales of $836.1 million in the first nine months of 2010.
Total Company comparable sales for the first nine months of 2011 increased 7.3%, on top of an increase of 10.5% in the prior year. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 7.5%, including increases of 2.6% at Ann Taylor stores, 41.1% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 5.8% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales increased by 7.1%, including an increase of 4.5% at LOFT stores, an increase of 29.0% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and a 16.3% increase in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 56.6%, compared to the 57.2% gross margin rate achieved in the first nine months of 2010.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2011 were $788.7 million, versus $726.6 million in the first nine months of 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 170 basis points versus the prior year to 47.9%. The improvement in the SG&A rate reflected substantially higher net sales and continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by costs associated with the Company's accelerated factory outlet strategy and an increase in variable costs associated with higher sales versus the 2010 period.
During the first nine months of 2011, the Company did not record any restructuring charges, compared with pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $1.7 million in the first nine months of 2010. On an after-tax basis, restructuring charges totaled $1.0 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2010.
The Company reported operating income of $142.3 million in the first nine months of 2011, an increase of 30.1% compared with operating income of $109.4 million in the first nine months of 2010. Net income was $84.4 million in the first nine months of 2011, an increase of 29.0% versus the $65.4 million reported in the first nine months of 2010. Diluted earnings per share in the first nine months of 2011 were $1.58 per diluted share, an increase of 43.6% over the $1.10 per diluted share reported in the first nine months of 2010.
For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011, the Company expects total net sales to be $580 million, reflecting mid-single digit comparable sales performance. Gross margin rate performance is expected to approach 52%. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to approach $275 million, with the increase versus last year primarily reflecting support for the Company's strategic growth initiative to accelerate factory outlet expansion, an increased investment in marketing compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and higher variable store operating costs to support planned top-line growth.
In terms of the full year, the Company has updated its outlook for fiscal 2011, as follows:

Exhibit 99.1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today announced that, based on weaker-than-anticipated fourth quarter performance in the Ann Taylor stores channel, the Company expects to report results for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011 that will be below expectations.
New York, NY, February 2, 2012
In addition, the Company announced that it has named ANN INC. veteran Brian Lynch to the position of Brand President of the Ann Taylor Division. Mr. Lynch, who has been with the Company since 2004, was formerly President of Ann Taylor Factory and LOFT Outlet, and led the e-commerce channels for both brands.
Based on preliminary results, the Company is also providing the following update to the fiscal fourth quarter outlook it provided on November 18, 2011, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, during the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 3.1 million shares of its stock, totaling approximately $75 million.
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are disappointed with our fourth quarter results in the Ann Taylor stores channel, but are pleased that the brand's online and factory channels continued to deliver strong results. Importantly, our LOFT brand delivered outstanding results across all three channels, reflecting very positive client response to LOFT's product offering during the quarter.
"Overall, our strategies to deliver profitable growth in 2011 resulted in a more than 25 percent increase in earnings per diluted share on a 12 percent increase in total net sales, compared to 2010. Looking ahead to fiscal 2012, we have entered the Spring season with inventories well positioned at both brands, and we look forward to capitalizing on the opportunities to continue our profitable growth and improve performance in the Ann Taylor stores channel in the coming year.
In commenting on Mr. Lynch's appointment, Ms. Krill stated, "Brian has driven outstanding results across diverse businesses, channels and responsibilities at ANN INC. over the past 8 years. I am confident that, under his leadership, the Ann Taylor brand will grow and deliver increased productivity and profitability."
During his tenure, Mr. Lynch substantially grew the highly profitable factory outlet channel from $150 million in annual revenues to approximately $500 million in fiscal 2011. Also under his leadership, the Company's e-commerce channels have grown significantly and are expected to deliver approximately $250 million in sales this year, doubling the business in the last two years.
As a result of the reorganization, Christine Beauchamp, former Brand President of the Ann Taylor Division, has left the Company to pursue other opportunities. Stated Ms. Krill, "We appreciate Christine's contributions towards evolving the Ann Taylor brand and wish her much success in her future endeavors."
Based on preliminary fourth quarter results, the Company also updated the outlook for the full year of fiscal 2011 it provided on November 18, 2011, as follows:
 
 
 
 
ANN INC (NYSE: ANN) will release its fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2011 results on Friday, March 9, 2012. Results will be released over PR Newswire at approximately 8:00 A.M. Eastern Time.

 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2011, ended January 28, 2012. The Company also provided its outlook for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2012.
New York, NY, March 9, 2012
For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2011, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.10, excluding $0.06 per diluted share in after-tax charges associated with its previously announced management realignment, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.19 in the fourth quarter of 2010, excluding after-tax restructuring charges of $0.05 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned charges, earnings per diluted share were $0.04 in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2010.
For the full year of fiscal 2011, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $1.70, excluding $0.06 per diluted share in after-tax management realignment charges, an increase of 31% compared with earnings per diluted share of $1.30 in the full year of fiscal 2010, excluding after-tax restructuring charges totaling $0.06 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, including the aforementioned management realignment and restructuring charges, earnings per diluted share were $1.64 in fiscal 2011, compared with $1.24 per diluted share in fiscal 2010.
Kay Krill, President and CEO commented, "For 2011, ANN INC. delivered another year of significant profitable growth, reflecting double digit increases in sales, net income and earnings per diluted share. Total net sales for the year rose 12 percent, with net income, excluding charges, up 17 percent and diluted earnings per share, excluding charges, up 31 percent. During 2011, we also delivered on our commitment to further enhance shareholder value through the repurchase of 7.3 million shares, or nearly 15 percent of our outstanding shares.
"For the fourth quarter, the Company delivered a ten percent increase in total net sales. However, our overall bottom-line results were impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated promotional activity in the Ann Taylor stores channel. Importantly, the Anntaylor.com and Ann Taylor Factory channels delivered strong results in the quarter. Our LOFT brand delivered outstanding results across all three channels. We achieved very positive client response to LOFT's product offering in LOFT stores, as well as in our e-commerce and outlet channels during the quarter.
"Looking ahead to 2012, we are focused on continuing LOFT's strong momentum as well as improving the sales productivity and profitability at Ann Taylor stores. We will continue to aggressively manage all operational aspects of the business, while remaining focused on accelerating our strategic growth initiatives that are expected to benefit this year and beyond."
Total net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 were $566.7 million, compared with net sales of $515.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $237.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with net sales of $234.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $329.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with net sales of $280.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2010. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales decreased 1.1%, reflecting a decrease of 10.9% at Ann Taylor stores, partially offset by increases of 28.0% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 5.7% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales increased 10.5%, reflecting increases of 8.1% at LOFT stores, 28.1% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and 10.3% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 48.9%, versus the 51.7% gross margin rate achieved in the fourth quarter of 2010. This gross margin performance primarily reflected a significantly higher level of promotional activity in the Ann Taylor stores channel versus the fourth quarter of 2010.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2011 were $274.0 million versus $252.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved 50 basis points versus the prior year to 48.4%. This improvement in SG&A rate reflected higher net sales and continued aggressive management of expenses, partially offset by one-time costs associated with the aforementioned management realignment.
During the quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $5.5 million associated with its previously announced management realignment. During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $3.9 million associated with its strategic restructuring program. On an after-tax basis, these charges totaled $3.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011 and $3.0 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Excluding the aforementioned pre-tax charges, the Company reported operating income of $8.7 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. On the same basis, the Company reported net income in the quarter of $5.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared with net income of $11.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. On a GAAP basis, the Company reported operating income of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with operating income of $10.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. On the same basis, the Company reported net income of $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared with net income of $8.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2010. The tax rate used to calculate non-GAAP after-tax charges and non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2011 was based on the Company's full year effective tax rate.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company opened eight new stores, comprised of four Ann Taylor stores, two LOFT stores and two Ann Taylor Factory stores, and closed five LOFT stores.
Total net sales for the full year of fiscal 2011 were $2.2 billion, compared with net sales of nearly $2.0 billion in the full year of fiscal 2010. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $907.9 million in fiscal 2011, compared with net sales of $863.7 million in fiscal 2010. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $1,304.6 million in 2011, compared with net sales of $1,116.5 million in 2010.
Total Company comparable sales for fiscal 2011 increased 6.8% versus the prior year. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 5.2%, reflecting a decrease of 1.2% at Ann Taylor stores, which was more than offset by increases of 36.8% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 5.7% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $1,062.6 million versus $978.6 million in fiscal 2010. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 48.0% in fiscal 2011, reflecting 140 basis points leverage versus 49.4% in fiscal 2010.
During fiscal 2011, the Company recorded pre-tax management realignment charges of $5.5 million, compared with pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $5.6 million in fiscal 2010. On an after-tax basis, these charges totaled $3.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in fiscal 2011, compared with $3.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in fiscal 2010.
Excluding the aforementioned pre-tax charges, operating income for the full year of fiscal 2011 was $151.0 million, compared with operating income of $125.4 million in 2010.

The Company ended the year with approximately $150 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, declined 1% at the end of fiscal 2011. This reflected an inventory per square foot decrease of 11% at Ann Taylor stores, an increase of 6% at LOFT stores and a decrease of 6% in the factory outlet channel.
During fiscal 2011, the Company opened 76 stores, comprised of 17 Ann Taylor stores, seven Ann Taylor Factory stores, 14 LOFT stores and 38 LOFT Outlet stores and closed 19 stores, comprised of three Ann Taylor stores and 16 LOFT stores. The total store count at the end of the fiscal year was 953, comprised of 280 Ann Taylor stores, 99 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 500 LOFT stores, and 74 LOFT Outlet stores.
For the fiscal first quarter of 2012, the Company expects total net sales to be $560 million, reflecting a total Company comparable sales increase in the low-single digits.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal first quarter of 2012, ended April 28, 2012. The Company also provided its outlook for the second quarter and the full year of fiscal 2012.
New York, NY, May 18, 2012
For the fiscal first quarter of 2012, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.58, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.51 in the first quarter of 2011.
Kay Krill, President and CEO, said, "We are very pleased that our 2012 fiscal year is off to a strong start. We reported an excellent first quarter with significant increases in both sales and earnings per share. Our gross margin rate also improved dramatically from the fourth quarter of 2011, driven by increased profits at both the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands.
"By brand, LOFT once again delivered a phenomenal quarter, continuing its strong momentum across all channels. Clients responded positively to LOFT's entire product offering, its compelling value proposition and engaging in-store experience, all of which contributed to very strong conversion. During the quarter, the Ann Taylor brand continued to deliver top-line growth in its online and outlet channels. In the stores channel, we significantly reduced promotional activity as we focused on reinforcing the aspirational nature of the brand, which resulted in a higher gross margin rate and lower comparable sales versus the first quarter of 2011.
"Looking forward, ANN INC. is well-positioned to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives for the year."
Total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were $560.4 million, compared with net sales of $523.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $212.4 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with net sales of $222.9 million in the first quarter of 2011. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $348.0 million in the first quarter of 2012, compared with net sales of $300.8 million in the first quarter of 2011.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 3.8% versus the first quarter of 2011. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales decreased 6.9%, reflecting a decrease of 15.5% at Ann Taylor stores, partially offset by increases of 9.6% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 0.7% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales increased 11.3%, reflecting increases of 10.0% at LOFT stores, 29.1% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and 6.1% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 56.6%, versus the 57.3% gross margin rate achieved in the first quarter of 2011, reflecting a strong gross margin rate performance at Ann Taylor and a slightly lower gross margin rate at LOFT.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2012 were $272.0 million versus $254.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2011. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were flat with the prior year at 48.5%, reflecting the benefit of increased cost leverage as a result of higher net sales compared with the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, offset by an increase in expenses associated with our year-over-year store growth and other expenses supporting the expansion of our business.
The Company reported operating income of $45.4 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $45.9 million in the first quarter of 2011. Net income for the first quarter was $28.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared with net income of $27.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011.
The Company ended the quarter with approximately $106 million in cash and cash equivalents, following the repurchase of approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $35 million during the fiscal first quarter of 2012.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, at the end of the first quarter increased 3% versus year-ago, reflecting a 3% increase at Ann Taylor stores, a 7% increase at LOFT stores and a 6% decrease in the factory/outlet channel. The increase at Ann Taylor stores reflects earlier receipt of goods in-transit versus last year, without which, inventory per square foot at Ann Taylor stores would have declined by approximately 5%.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company opened seven new stores, comprised of two Ann Taylor stores, four LOFT stores and one LOFT Outlet store, and closed eight Ann Taylor stores, four LOFT stores and one LOFT Outlet store. Total store count at the end of the fiscal first quarter was 947, comprised of 274 Ann Taylor stores, 500 LOFT stores, 99 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 74 LOFT Outlet stores.
For the fiscal second quarter of 2012, the Company expects total net sales to be $585 million, reflecting a total Company comparable sales increase in the mid-single digits. Gross margin rate performance is expected to approach 55.0%. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to approach $280 million.
In terms of the full year outlook, the Company provided the following:

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal second quarter of 2012, ended July 28, 2012. The Company also provided its outlook for the third quarter and raised its outlook for the full year of fiscal 2012.
New York, NY, August 17, 2012
For the fiscal second quarter of 2012, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.63, an increase of 34 percent compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.47 in the second quarter of 2011.
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We are extremely pleased with ANN INC.'s record earnings per share of $0.63 this quarter, up 34% over last year. Our outstanding results were driven by a seven percent increase in sales, including a comparable sales increase of five percent, a record gross margin rate of 56 percent and a 27 percent increase in operating income.
"At the Ann Taylor brand, performance accelerated significantly from the first quarter, reflecting stronger sales and profitability, including positive comps in the Ann Taylor stores channel and continued profitable growth in the e-commerce and factory outlet channels. LOFT also delivered excellent sales and profitability results, including strong margin and continued solid comp growth on top of last year's double-digit increase. Clearly, our performance at both brands demonstrated strong product acceptance driven by the successful delivery of compelling fashion, excellent quality, outstanding value and an engaging shopping experience, in store and online."
Total net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2012 were $594.9 million, compared with net sales of $558.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2011. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $233.3 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with net sales of $217.9 million in the second quarter of 2011. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels totaled $361.6 million in the second quarter of 2012, compared with net sales of $340.3 million in the second quarter of 2011.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 4.7% versus the second quarter of 2011. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 5.6%, reflecting increases of 3.2% at Ann Taylor stores, 29.0% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 2.1% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel.

(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, reached a record 55.9%, compared with the 55.0% gross margin rate achieved in the second quarter of 2011. The outstanding gross margin performance in the second quarter of 2012 reflected strong client response to our product and lower promotional activity versus the second quarter of 2011 at both brands.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2012 were $279.5 million versus $265.1 million reported in the second quarter of 2011. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 47.0% compared to the second quarter 2011 rate of 47.5%. The improved SG&A rate during the second quarter of 2012 primarily reflected fixed cost leveraging resulting from higher net sales, partially offset by expenses associated with our year-over-year store growth and other expenses supporting the expansion of the business.
The Company reported operating income of $52.9 million in the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 27% compared with operating income of $41.7 million in the second quarter of 2011.

Diluted earnings per share was $0.63, an increase of 34% compared to the $0.47 per diluted share reported in the second quarter of 2011.
The Company ended the quarter with approximately $133 million in cash and cash equivalents, following the repurchase of approximately 1.6 million shares of its stock at a cost of approximately $40 million during the fiscal second quarter of 2012.
Total inventory per square foot, excluding e-commerce, at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2012 increased 2%, reflecting an 11% increase at Ann Taylor stores, a 2% increase at LOFT stores and a 9% decrease in the factory outlet channel. The increase at Ann Taylor stores reflects earlier receipt of goods in-transit versus last year, without which, inventory per square foot at Ann Taylor stores would have increased by approximately 3%.
During the second quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company opened 17 stores, comprised of three Ann Taylor stores, one Ann Taylor Factory store, seven LOFT stores and six LOFT Outlet stores, and closed two LOFT stores. The total store count at the end of the fiscal second quarter was 962, comprised of 277 Ann Taylor stores, 100 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 505 LOFT stores, and 80 LOFT Outlet stores.

At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales decreased 0.8%, including a decrease of 6.6% at Ann Taylor stores, partially offset by increases of 18.0% in the Ann Taylor e-commerce channel and 1.5% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales increased by 7.5%, including increases of 6.9% at LOFT stores, 22.4% in the LOFT e-commerce channel and 2.5% in the LOFT Outlet channel.

As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved 30 basis points versus the prior year to 47.7%. The improvement in the SG&A rate primarily reflected fixed cost leveraging resulting from higher net sales, partially offset by expenses associated with our year-over-year store growth and other expenses supporting the expansion of the business.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal third quarter of 2012, ended October 27, 2012. The Company also provided its outlook for the fourth quarter and increased its outlook for the full year of fiscal 2012.
New York, NY, November 28, 2012
For the fiscal third quarter of 2012, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.61 in the third quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per share for the fiscal third quarter of 2012 included a benefit of $0.08 related to the recognition of gift card and merchandise credit breakage, without which, diluted earnings per share reached a third quarter record of $0.76.
Kay Krill, President and CEO, said, "We are very pleased to report that ANN INC. delivered record EPS results again this quarter. Significant top-line growth, coupled with a double-digit percentage increase in operating income, contributed to a 25 percent increase in diluted earnings per share, excluding the $0.08 benefit. Our strong performance was driven by both Ann Taylor and LOFT. Both brands delivered a positive comp for the quarter by remaining clearly focused on what's important to our clients: great fashion, excellent quality, outstanding value and a seamless and engaging shopping experience.
"In addition, we have made significant progress on our strategic initiatives to drive future growth and profitability. Among the highlights, in September we successfully launched the first phase of our multi-channel initiative, which is off to a strong start and will provide meaningful opportunities to better leverage our inventory investment and maximize sales and gross margin. During the quarter, we also made our entry into Canada, opening our first store in Toronto in September, followed by two additional stores in November. The response has been outstanding, and we are very excited about the opportunities in this market. Overall, it was an excellent quarter for ANN INC., and we have entered the fourth quarter in a strong position."
Total net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2012 were $612.5 million, compared with total net sales of $564.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $244.6 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared with net sales of $229.7 million in the third quarter of 2011. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $368.0 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared with net sales of $334.3 million in the third quarter of 2011.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter increased 5.5%, on top of an increase of 5.5% in the third quarter of 2011. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 4.3%, reflecting increases of 5.6% at Ann Taylor, which includes sales results from both Ann Taylor stores and anntaylor.com, and 1.7% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales were up 6.2%, reflecting an increase of 8.0% at LOFT, which includes sales results from both LOFT stores and LOFT.com, slightly offset by a decline of 3.0% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 57.9%, compared with the 57.5% gross margin rate achieved in the third quarter of 2011. The strong gross margin performance in the third quarter of 2012 reflected favorable client response to our product and lower promotional activity versus the third quarter of 2011 at both brands.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2012 were $287.5 million versus $269.5 million reported in the third quarter of 2011. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved 90 basis points to 46.9% compared to the third quarter 2011 rate of 47.8%. The improved SG&A rate during the third quarter of 2012 primarily reflected fixed cost leveraging resulting from higher net sales, partially offset by expenses associated with our year-over-year store growth and other expenses supporting the expansion of the business.
The Company reported operating income of $66.9 million in the third quarter of 2012, compared with operating income of $54.7 million in the third quarter of 2011. Net income was $40.7 million in the third quarter of 2012, versus the $32.3 million reported in the third quarter of 2011. Diluted earnings per share of $0.84 included the aforementioned benefit of $0.08 related to recognition of a portion of the unredeemed value of gift cards and merchandise credits. Excluding this benefit, diluted earnings per share was $0.76, an increase of 25 percent compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.61 in the third quarter of 2011.
The Company ended the quarter with approximately $167 million in cash and cash equivalents.
Total Company inventory per square foot, including inventory for both stores and e-commerce, at the end of the fiscal third quarter of 2012 decreased 5%, reflecting a 1% increase at Ann Taylor, a 1% decrease at LOFT and an 18% decrease in the factory outlet channel.
During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company opened 25 stores, comprised of four Ann Taylor stores, one Ann Taylor Factory store, eight LOFT stores and twelve LOFT Outlet stores. The Company also closed three Ann Taylor and three LOFT stores. The total store count at the end of the fiscal third quarter was 981, comprised of 278 Ann Taylor stores, 101 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 510 LOFT stores, and 92 LOFT Outlet stores.
Net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2012 were $1.8 billion, compared with net sales of $1.6 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2011. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand were $690.2 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared with net sales of $670.5 million in the first nine months of 2011. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $1,077.6 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared with net sales of $975.3 million in the first nine months of 2011.
Total Company comparable sales for the first nine months of 2012 increased 4.7%, on top of an increase of 7.3% in the comparable period of 2011. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 0.9%, including increases of 0.6% at our multichannel Ann Taylor business and 1.5% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales increased 7.1%, including increases of 8.2% at our multichannel LOFT business and 0.4% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 56.8% in the first nine months of 2012, compared with 56.6% in the first nine months of 2011.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first nine months of 2012 were $839.0 million, versus $788.7 million in the first nine months of 2011. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved 40 basis points versus the prior year to 47.5%. The improvement in the SG&A rate primarily reflected fixed cost leveraging resulting from higher net sales, partially offset by expenses associated with our year-over-year store growth and other expenses supporting the expansion of the business.
The Company reported operating income of $165.2 million in the first nine months of 2012, an increase of 16% compared with operating income of $142.3 million in the first nine months of 2011. Net income was $100.2 million in the first nine months of 2012, an increase of 19% versus the $84.4 million reported in the first nine months of 2011. Diluted earnings per share in the first nine months of 2012 was $2.05, an increase of 30% over the $1.58 per diluted share reported in the first nine months of 2011.

EXHIBIT 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today announced that it expects to report record earnings per share for the full year of fiscal 2012, notwithstanding lower-than-anticipated results for the fourth quarter.
New York, NY, February 7, 2013
Based on preliminary results, the Company is providing an update to the full year fiscal 2012 outlook it provided on November 28, 2012, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "We are pleased that we will be reporting very strong year-over-year results for fiscal 2012. For the full year, we expect to report record earnings per share and double-digit growth in net income. We will also report strong sales and increased operating profit, as well as strong double-digit growth in e-commerce for the year, all of which reflect the benefit of our strategic growth initiatives.
"In terms of the fourth quarter, the drivers of the softer-than-expected results were twofold: First, ANN INC. has a high concentration of sales in the Northeast region, which were negatively impacted by the lingering effects of Hurricane Sandy. In addition, LOFT's fourth-quarter investment in bright colors did not resonate with our clients this holiday season. As a result,
promotions at LOFT ramped up in the back half of the quarter, which pressured margins but effectively cleared through Holiday inventories in order to enter the Spring season in a healthy position.
"At Ann Taylor, we were pleased that the brand continued to make meaningful progress, achieving higher sales and gross margin for the quarter, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011. In addition, the factory outlet channel was successful in delivering profitable growth despite soft traffic and comparable sales.
"Looking ahead, we have entered the first quarter with clean inventories at both brands, and we are well positioned to deliver profitable growth in fiscal 2013. We remain focused on continuing the successful roll-out of our strategic initiatives and remain confident that these will drive further long-term growth," she said.
Based on preliminary results, the Company is providing an update to the fiscal fourth quarter 2012 outlook it provided on November 28, 2012, as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) will release its fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2012 results on Friday, March 8, 2013. Results will be released over PR Newswire at approximately 8:00 A.M. Eastern Time. The Company will also host a live conference call and simultaneous audio webcast from 8:30 A.M. to 9:30 A.M. Eastern Time which will include comments from management and a question and answer session.

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2012, ended February 2, 2013. The Company also provided its outlook for the first quarter and full year of fiscal 2013.
New York, NY, March 8, 2013
For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.05, compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.04 in the fourth quarter of 2011.
For the full year of fiscal 2012, the Company reported record earnings per diluted share of $2.10, an increase of 28% compared with earnings per diluted share of $1.64 in the full year of fiscal 2011.
Kay Krill, President and CEO commented, "Fiscal 2012 was another strong year for ANN INC., including record EPS results and double-digit growth in net income. This performance reflects our third consecutive year of positive comparable sales and our fourth year of operating profit expansion. Our 2012 results were driven by strong client response to our product offering as well as the positive impact of our strategic initiatives. In addition, we delivered on our commitment to further enhance shareholder value through the repurchase of nearly 5 million shares.
"For the fourth quarter, as previously reported, the results reflected the negative impact of Superstorm Sandy and disappointing performance at LOFT due to an investment in bright colors that did not resonate with our client during the Holiday season. At Ann Taylor, the brand continued to show meaningful progress during the quarter, delivering higher sales and profitability. We also achieved profitable growth in the outlet channel, as Ann Taylor Factory and LOFT Outlet delivered stronger bottom-line results versus the fourth quarter of 2011, despite lower comparable sales.
"Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to build on our progress and further grow our Ann Taylor and LOFT brands. We see significant potential to expand the reach of both brands and are very excited about the progress we are achieving as we continue to execute on our growth strategies. Our investment in our multi-channel capability has created meaningful new opportunities and together with our real estate initiatives, entry into Canada and launch of international shipping  provide a strong foundation for future growth in 2013," Ms. Krill said.
Total net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were $607.7 million, compared with net sales of $566.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $255.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with net sales of $237.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $352.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with net sales of $329.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter decreased 0.7% versus the fourth quarter of 2011. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 1.4%, reflecting an increase of 5.0% at Ann Taylor, which includes sales results from both Ann Taylor stores and anntaylor.com, and a decline of 6.8% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales decreased 2.1%, reflecting a decrease of 1.2% at LOFT, which includes sales results from both LOFT stores and LOFT.com, and a decrease of 7.1% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 49.1%, an increase of 20 basis points compared with the 48.9% gross margin rate achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011. This gross margin performance primarily reflected lower promotional activity at Ann Taylor, partially offset by a higher level of promotional activity at LOFT, versus the fourth quarter of 2011.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2012 were $296.6 million versus $274.0 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2011. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 48.8%, compared with 48.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase in SG&A rate during the fourth quarter of 2012 primarily reflected fixed cost deleveraging related to our year-over-year store growth and other expenses supporting the expansion of the business that were partially offset by higher net sales, compared with the fourth quarter of 2011.
The Company reported operating income of $1.6 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income in the quarter was $2.4 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net income of $2.2 million, or $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company opened 14 new stores, comprised of two Ann Taylor stores, seven LOFT stores, one Ann Taylor Factory store and four LOFT Outlet stores. The Company closed five Ann Taylor stores, five LOFT stores and one Ann Taylor Factory store.
Total net sales for the full year of fiscal 2012 were $2.4 billion, compared with net sales of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2011. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $945.2 million in fiscal 2012, compared with net sales of $907.9 million in fiscal 2011. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $1,430.3 million in 2012, compared with net sales of $1,304.6 million in 2011.
Total Company comparable sales for the full year of fiscal 2012 increased 3.3%. At the Ann Taylor brand, total comparable sales increased 1.1%, including an increase of 1.8% at Ann Taylor, which was partially offset by a decrease of 0.5% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At the LOFT brand, total comparable sales increased 4.8%, including an increase of 5.8% at LOFT, which was partially offset by a decrease of 1.5% in the LOFT Outlet channel.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales, was 54.8%, compared with 54.6% in fiscal 2011.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,135.6 million versus $1,062.6 million in fiscal 2011. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 47.8% in fiscal 2012, reflecting a 20 basis-point improvement from the prior year.
Operating income for the full year of fiscal 2012 was $166.8 million, reflecting a 15% increase compared with operating income of $145.5 million in 2011.
Net income totaled $102.6 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, for fiscal 2012, compared with net income of $86.6 million, or $1.64 per diluted share, for fiscal 2011.
The Company ended the year with approximately $167 million in cash and cash equivalents. During fiscal 2012, the Company repurchased approximately 4.9 million of its outstanding shares at a total cost of $135 million.
Total Company inventory per square foot, including inventory for stores and e-commerce, was flat at the end of fiscal 2012, compared with fiscal 2011, which reflected flat inventory per square foot at Ann Taylor, LOFT and the factory outlet channel, over the same period last year.
During fiscal 2012, the Company opened 63 stores, comprised of 11 Ann Taylor stores, three Ann Taylor Factory stores, 26 LOFT stores and 23 LOFT Outlet stores and closed 32 stores, comprised of 16 Ann Taylor stores, 14 LOFT stores, one Ann Taylor Factory store and one LOFT Outlet store. The total store count at the end of the fiscal year was 984, comprised of 275 Ann Taylor stores, 101 Ann Taylor Factory stores, 512 LOFT stores, and 96 LOFT Outlet stores.
For the fiscal first quarter of 2013, the Company expects total net sales to be $600 million, reflecting a total Company comparable sales increase in the low-single digits.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today announced that, based on weaker-than-anticipated performance, the Company is updating its outlook for the fiscal first quarter of 2013.
New York, NY, May 9, 2013
Based on preliminary results, the Company's first quarter outlook, provided on March 8, 2013, is being updated as follows:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kay Krill, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, "In light of the unseasonably cold weather this Spring, we were more promotional than planned in order to move through warm weather product categories, particularly at LOFT.
"From a comparable sales standpoint, LOFT's softer-than-anticipated performance reflected the breadth and depth of its warm-weather offering, combined with a challenging comparison to its strong performance in the first quarter of 2012. Ann Taylor's performance reflected a more transitional wear-now assortment, which resonated with clients and delivered positive comparable sales growth. In factory outlet centers, soft traffic continued to pressure comps at both Ann Taylor Factory and Loft Outlet stores, although margins remained strong in these channels. Importantly, we entered the second quarter with very clean inventories and are well-positioned with fresh new fashion at both brands.
"Finally, we are pleased to note that sales have improved since late April with the arrival of more seasonable temperatures, resulting in positive comparable sales at both brands," Ms. Krill said.
ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) will release its fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, June 6, 2013. Results will be released over PR Newswire at approximately 8:00 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time. The Company will also host a live conference call and simultaneous audio webcast from 8:30 A.M. to 9:30 A.M. Eastern Daylight Time which will include comments from management and a question and answer session.

Exhibit 3.1
 
 
 
 
ANN INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), does hereby certify as follows:
: That Section (3) of Article SIXTH of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:
FIRST
"(3) The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three nor more than fifteen directors, with the exact number of directors to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office. The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. Each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting at which the director was elected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) at the 2014 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders; (ii) at the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting shall be elected to hold office for a one-year term expiring at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders; and (iii) at the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders and each annual meeting of stockholders thereafter, all directors shall be elected for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders. Pursuant to such procedures, effective as of the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, the Board of Directors will no longer be classified under Section 141(d) of the GCL and directors shall no longer be divided into three classes. Prior to the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting
for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director of a class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor. Until the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, and in accordance with Section 141(k) of the GCL, directors may be removed by the stockholders of the Corporation only for cause, and from and after the 2016 annual meeting of stockholders, directors of the Corporation may be removed by the stockholders of the Corporation with or without cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Section (3) of Article SIXTH unless expressly provided by such terms."
: That this Amendment has been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

(1) The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.
(2) The directors shall have concurrent power with the stockholders to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.
(3) The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three nor more than fifteen directors, with the exact number of directors to be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office. The directors shall be divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class II. Each class shall consist, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third
of the total number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors. The term of the initial Class I directors shall terminate on the date of the 1992 annual meeting of stockholders; the term of the initial Class II directors shall terminate on the date of the 1993 annual meeting of stockholders; and the term of the initial Class III directors shall terminate on the date of the 1994 annual meeting of stockholders. At each annual meeting of stockholders beginning in 1992, successors to the class of directors whose term expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term. If the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office. Any vacancy on the Board of Directors that results from an increase in the number of directors may be filled by a majority of the Board of Directors then in office, provided that a quorum is present, and any other vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Any director of a class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class. Any director elected to fill a vacancy not resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall have the same remaining term as that of his or her predecessor. Directors of the Corporation may be removed by the stockholders of the Corporation only for cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the holders of any one or more classes or series of preferred stock issued by the Corporation shall have the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, filling of
vacancies and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this Restated Certificate of Incorporation applicable thereto, and such directors so elected shall not be divided into classes pursuant to this Section (3) of Article SIXTH unless expressly provided by such terms.

Exhibit 10.1
1. Purpose.
This 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is intended to encourage stock ownership by employees of ANN INC. (the "Corporation"), its divisions and Subsidiary Corporations, so that they may acquire or increase their proprietary interest in the Corporation, and to encourage such employees to remain in the employ of the Corporation, its divisions and Subsidiary Corporations, and to put forth maximum efforts for the success of the business. The Plan is also intended to encourage Directors of the Corporation who are not employees or officers of the Corporation or its Subsidiary Corporations ("Eligible Directors") to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in the Corporation and to further promote and strengthen the interest of such Eligible Directors in the development and financial success of the Corporation and to assist the Corporation in attracting and retaining highly qualified Eligible Directors.
2. Definitions.
As used in this Plan, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings indicated:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. Administration.
The Plan shall be administered by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") (or any duly authorized subcommittee of the Committee). The Committee shall consist solely of two or more members of the Board, each of whom shall be an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m), a "nonemployee director" within the meaning of Rule 16b-3, as from time to time amended, promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and an "independent director" within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual.
The Committee shall have the authority in its discretion, subject to and not inconsistent with the express provisions of the Plan, to administer the Plan and to exercise all the powers and authorities either specifically granted to it under the Plan or necessary or advisable in the administration of the Plan, including, without limitation, the authority to grant Awards; to determine the purchase price of the shares of Common Stock covered by each Option (the "Option Price"); to determine the exercise price of the shares of Common Stock covered by each SAR (the "SAR Exercise Price"); to determine the persons to whom, and the time or times at which, Awards shall be granted; to determine the number of shares to be covered by each Option, SAR or Other Award and to determine the number of Restricted Shares and Restricted Units to be covered by each Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Unit Award; to interpret the Plan; to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Plan; to determine the terms and provisions of the agreements (which need not be identical) entered into in connection with grants of Options and SARs ("Option Agreements" and "SAR Agreements"), Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Unit Awards ("Restricted Award Agreements") or Other Awards ("Other Award Agreements"); and to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to the provisions of Section 6(k)), the Committee shall not have the authority to reduce the exercise price for any Option or SAR by repricing or replacing such Option or SAR unless the Corporation shall have obtained the prior consent of its stockholders.
The determinations of the Committee shall be binding and conclusive on all parties. The Committee may delegate to one or more of its members or to one or more agents such administrative duties as it may deem advisable, and the Committee or any person to whom it has delegated duties as aforesaid may employ one or
 
more persons to render advice with respect to any responsibility the Committee or such person may have under the Plan. The Committee shall have the authority in its discretion to delegate to specified officers of the Corporation the power to make Awards, including, without limitation, to determine the terms of such Awards, and the power to extend the exercisability of Options and SARs pursuant to Section 6(g) or 6(h) hereof, in each case consistent with the terms of this Plan (but only to the extent permissible under Section 409A of the Code, hereinafter, "Section 409A," and the provisions of Section 157 of the Delaware General Corporations Law) and subject to such restrictions, if any, as the Committee may specify when making such delegation; that the delegates shall not have authority to make Awards to, or extend the exercisability of Options and SARs held by, such delegates or any Executive Officer or Eligible Director. Any delegation of duties by the Committee pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the requirements of Section 162(m), Rule 16b-3 and the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, as applicable.
provided
No member of the Board or Committee shall be liable for any action taken or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award made hereunder.
4. Eligibility.
Awards may be granted to employees (including, without limitation, officers who are employees) of the Corporation or its present or future divisions and Subsidiary Corporations, and to Eligible Directors. In determining the persons to whom Awards shall be granted and the number of shares to be covered by each Award, the Committee shall take into account the duties of the respective persons, their present and potential contributions to the success of the Corporation and such other factors as the Committee shall deem relevant in connection with accomplishing the purpose of the Plan. A person to whom an Option has been granted hereunder is sometimes referred to herein as an "Optionee."
A Grantee shall be eligible to receive more than one Award during the term of the Plan, but only on the terms and subject to the restrictions hereinafter set forth.
5. Stock.
The shares of Common Stock available to be delivered upon issuance or settlement of an Award hereunder may, in whole or in part, be authorized but unissued shares or shares that shall have been or may be reacquired by the Corporation. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock as to which Awards may be granted from time to time under this Plan on or after the date of the 2013 meeting of the shareholders of the Corporation shall not exceed 3,425,000, it being understood that one (1) share shall count against such limit for each share of Common Stock underlying an Award granted pursuant to the Plan after February 2, 2013. The maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be covered by Incentive Stock Options shall not exceed 800,000 in the aggregate.
Under the Plan, no single Grantee may be granted Awards in the aggregate covering more than 800,000 shares of Common Stock, of which up to 800,000 Awards may be Incentive Stock Options, during any fiscal year of the Corporation. The limitations set forth in this Section 5 shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section 6(k) or 7(f) hereof, as applicable.
If after February 2, 2013 any shares subject to an Award are forfeited, canceled, exchanged or surrendered, or if an Award otherwise terminates or expires without a distribution or payment required to be made to the Grantee in respect of all or a portion of the shares subject to the Award, the shares of Common Stock with respect to such Award shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture, cancellation, exchange, surrender, termination or expiration, again be available for Awards under the Plan. In connection with the exercise of an Option or SAR (whether settled in cash or in shares of Common Stock) the excess of the number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Option or SAR is exercised over the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered to the Grantee (or in the case of a cash settlement, the number of shares equivalent in value to the cash
 
delivered) in connection with such exercise shall again be available for Awards under the Plan. Shares of Common Stock available for Awards under the Plan shall be increased by the following: (i) shares tendered or withheld in payment of the exercise price of an award and (ii) shares tendered or withheld in respect of tax withholding obligations.
Substitute Awards shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock available for Awards under the Plan, nor shall shares of Common Stock subject to Substitute Awards again be available for Awards under the Plan pursuant to the preceding paragraph. Additionally, in the event that a company which is acquired by or combined with the Corporation or any Subsidiary Corporation has shares available under a pre-existing plan approved by shareholders and not adopted in contemplation of such acquisition or combination, the shares available for grant pursuant to the terms of such pre-existing plan (as adjusted, to the extent appropriate, using the exchange ratio or other adjustment or valuation ratio or formula used in such acquisition or combination to determine the consideration payable to the holders of common stock of the entities party to such acquisition or combination) may be used for Awards under the Plan and shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for grant under the Plan (and shares subject to such Awards shall not be again available for grant under this Plan); , that Awards granted using such available shares shall not be made after the date awards or grants could have been made under the terms of the pre-existing plan, absent the acquisition or combination, and shall only be made to individuals who were not employees or directors of the Corporation or any Subsidiary Corporation immediately prior to such acquisition or combination.
provided
6. Terms and Conditions of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights.
Each Option and SAR granted pursuant to the Plan shall be evidenced by a written Option Agreement or SAR Agreement (as applicable) between the Corporation and the Grantee, which agreement shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions (and with such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as the Committee, in its discretion, shall establish):
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(2) If an Acceleration Event (as defined below) shall occur while unexercisable Options or SARs remain outstanding under the Plan, such Options and SARs not theretofore exercisable by their terms shall become exercisable in full. An "Acceleration Event" shall occur if:
(A) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act), other than any person who on the date hereof is a director or officer of the Corporation, any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Corporation, or any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Corporation in substantially the same
 
proportions as their ownership of stock of the Corporation, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Corporation representing 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Corporation's then outstanding securities;
(B) during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board, and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Corporation to effect a transaction described in clause (A) or (C) of this Section 6(k)(2)) whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Corporation's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof;
(C) there is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Corporation with any other entity other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than 80% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Corporation or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; or
(D) the stockholders of the Corporation approve a plan of complete liquidation of the Corporation or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Corporation of all or substantially all of the Corporation's assets.
Following the Acceleration Event, the Committee may provide for the cancellation of all Options or SARs then outstanding. Upon such cancellation, the Corporation shall make, in exchange for each such Option or SAR, a payment either in (i) cash; (ii) shares of the successor entity; or (iii) some combination of cash or shares thereof, at the discretion of the Committee, and in each case in an amount per share subject to such Option or SAR equal to the difference between the per share exercise price of such Option or SAR and the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of the Acceleration Event. In the event that the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of the Acceleration Event is less than the per share exercise price of an Option or SAR, the Committee may cancel such Option or SAR without consideration therefor.
(3) In the event of a change in the Common Stock of the Corporation as presently constituted which is limited to a change of all of its authorized shares with par value into the same number of shares with a different par value or without par value, the shares resulting from any such change shall be deemed to be the Common Stock within the meaning of the Plan.
(4) The foregoing adjustments shall be made by the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive.
(5) Except as hereinbefore expressly provided in this Section 6(k), the Grantee shall have no rights by reason of any subdivision or consolidation of shares of stock of any class or the payment of any stock dividend or any other increase or decrease in the number of shares of stock of any class or by reason of any dissolution, liquidation, merger, or consolidation or spin-off of assets or stock of another corporation; and any issue by the Corporation of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option or SAR. The grant of an Option or SAR pursuant to the Plan shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Corporation to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations or changes of its capital or business structures or to merge or to consolidate or to dissolve, liquidate or sell, or transfer all or part of its business or assets.
 
 
 
 
7. Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Unit Awards.
Each Restricted Stock Award and Restricted Unit Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by a written Restricted Award Agreement between the Corporation and the Grantee, which agreement shall comply with, and be subject to, the following terms and conditions (and with such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as the Committee, in its discretion, shall establish):
 
 
In determining the Restricted Period of an award, the Committee may provide that the restrictions shall lapse with respect to specified percentages of the awarded shares or units on successive anniversaries of the date of such award or upon the satisfaction of such other conditions as the Committee may
 
impose, including, without limitation, the attainment of one or more Performance Goals. To the extent that the vesting of a Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Unit Award is subject to the attainment of one or more Performance Goals, any rights of the Grantee to receive dividends or dividend equivalents in respect of such Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Stock Unit Award shall also be subject to the attainment of such Performance Goals, and may not be paid prior to the achievement of such Performance Goals. The Committee may require that dividend and dividend equivalents on Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Unit Awards which are subject to time-based vesting requirements may not be paid until the Restricted Period with respect to such Restricted Stock Awards or Restricted Stock Unit Award has lapsed.
In no event shall the Restricted Period end with respect to a Restricted Stock Award or Restricted Unit Award prior to the satisfaction by the Grantee of any liability arising under Section 10 hereof. Any attempt to dispose of any Restricted Shares in contravention of any such restrictions shall be null and void and without effect. The period during which such restrictions on transfer, and such other restrictions as the Committee may impose, are in effect is referred to as the "Restricted Period."
 
 
 
 
 
 
8. Other Awards.
The Committee may grant equity-based or equity-related awards not otherwise described herein in such amounts and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine ("Other Awards"), which such Other Awards shall be evidenced by agreement in such form as the Committee shall from time to time approve. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, each such Other Awards may (i) involve the transfer of actual shares of Common Stock to Grantees, either at the time of grant or thereafter, or payment in cash or otherwise of amounts based on the value of shares of Common Stock, (ii) be subject to performance-based and/or service-based conditions, (iii) be in the form of phantom stock, performance shares, deferred share units, stock bonuses or share-denominated performance units, and (iv) be designed to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation; provided that to the extent that any such Other Award is subject to Section 409A, the agreement evidencing the grant of such Other Award shall contain terms and conditions (including, without limitation, deferral and payment provisions), that comply with Section 409A. To the extent the vesting of any Other Award is subject to the achievement of one or more Performance Goals, any rights of the Grantee to receive dividends or dividend equivalents in respect of such Other Awards shall be subject to the attainment of such Performance Goals, and may not be paid prior to the achievement of such Performance Goals.
9. Performance-Based Compensation.
The Committee may grant Awards intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation pursuant to the Plan which shall comply with and be subject to the following terms and conditions:
 
 
 
 
The Committee shall determine the length of the Performance Period with respect to each Award that is intended to be Performance-Based Compensation; provided that in no event shall such Performance Period be shorter than one fiscal year of the Corporation. Performance Periods may be overlapping. The Committee shall establish the Performance Targets and Performance Schedules for each Performance Period within ninety (90) days of the commencement of such Performance Period and not later than the expiration of the first 25% of the Performance Period.
The Committee may provide, in connection with the setting of the Performance Goals applicable to Awards intended to be Performance-Based Compensation, that any evaluation of performance may include or exclude certain unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Corporation, its financial statements or its shares, including, without limitation, the following: (i) asset write downs; (ii) litigation or claim judgments or settlements; (iii) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles or other laws or provisions affecting reported results; (iv) any reorganization and restructuring programs; (v) extraordinary nonrecurring items as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board 225-20 "Extraordinary and Unusual Items" and/or in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the applicable year; (vi) acquisitions or divestitures; and (vii) foreign exchange gains and losses. Such inclusions or exclusions shall be prescribed in a form that meets the requirements of Section 162(m) for deductibility.
Accounting Standards Codification
Nothing in this Section 9 is intended to limit the Committee's discretion to adopt conditions with respect to any Award that is not intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation that relate to performance other than the Performance Goals. In addition, the Committee may, subject to the terms of the Plan, amend previously granted Awards in a way that disqualifies them as Performance-Based Compensation.
In the event that the requirements of Section 162(m) and the regulations thereunder change to permit Committee discretion to alter the Performance Goals without obtaining stockholder approval of such changes, the Committee shall have sole discretion to make such changes without obtaining stockholder approval.
 
10. Withholding Taxes.
When a Grantee or other person becomes entitled to receive shares of Common Stock or cash pursuant to the exercise of an Option or SAR or upon the lapse of restrictions relating to a Restricted Stock Award, or to receive a cash payment or shares with respect to a Restricted Unit Award or Other Award upon the lapse of restrictions relating thereto, the Corporation shall have the right to require the Grantee or such other person to remit to the Corporation an amount sufficient to satisfy any federal, state and local withholding tax requirements related thereto. Unless otherwise prohibited by the Committee or by applicable law, satisfaction of the withholding tax obligation may be accomplished by any of the following methods or by a combination of such methods: (a) tendering a cash payment, (b) authorizing the Corporation to withhold from the shares of Common Stock or cash otherwise payable (1) one or more of such shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date the withholding tax obligation arises, less than or equal to the amount of the withholding tax obligation (which shall be calculated at the minimum required statutory rate) or (2) cash in an amount less than or equal to the amount of the total withholding tax obligation and (c) delivering to the Corporation previously-owned shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value, determined as of the date the withholding tax obligation arises, less than or equal to the amount of the total withholding tax obligation.
11. Term of Plan.
Unless terminated earlier by the Board, the term of this Plan shall be 10 years from the date the Plan was amended as of March 6, 2013. No Award shall be granted pursuant to this Plan later than March 6, 2023, but Awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date in accordance with their terms.
12. Amendment and Termination of the Plan.
The Board may, at any time and from time to time, suspend, terminate, modify or amend the Plan. Except as provided in Section 6 hereof, no suspension, termination, modification or amendment of the Plan may adversely affect any Award previously made, unless the written consent of the Grantee is obtained. Furthermore, except as provided in Section 6 hereof, no modification or amendment of the Plan shall be made that, without the approval of stockholders, would:
(a) increase the total number of shares reserved for the purpose of the Plan;
(b) reduce the exercise price for Options or SARs by repricing or replacing such Awards; or
(c) otherwise require approval under applicable law or the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (or such other national stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is listed) or to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m).
Other than as expressly provided in Section 6(k) herein, the Committee shall not have the authority to cancel any outstanding Option or SAR in exchange for cash, securities or another Award, or the issuance of a new Option or SAR (as applicable) in its place with a lower exercise price; provided, however, that this sentence shall not prohibit an exchange offer whereby the Corporation provides certain Grantees with an election to cancel an outstanding Option or SAR and receive cash or a grant of a new Option or SAR (as applicable) at a future date if such exchange offer only occurs with stockholder approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee shall have the authority to amend the Plan and any award made hereunder to the extent necessary to cause the Plan or such award to comply with the provisions of Section 409A and such amendment shall not require the consent of the Grantee.
13. Effective Date.
The Plan was initially adopted on March 11, 2003 by the Board of Directors. The Amended and Restated Plan dated March 6, 2013 is subject to approval by the shareholders of the Corporation.
 
14. Code Section 409A.
The Corporation intends that the Plan and each Award made hereunder that is subject to Section 409A shall comply with Section 409A and that the Plan shall be interpreted, operated and administered accordingly. In the event any term and/or condition of an Award made hereunder would cause the application of an accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A, such term and/or condition shall be restructured, to the extent possible, in a manner, determined by the Committee, that does not cause such an accelerated or additional tax. Any reservation of rights by the Corporation hereunder affecting the timing of payment of any Award subject to Section 409A will only be as broad as is permitted by Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Corporation or the Committee be liable for the payment of or gross up in connection with any taxes and or penalties owed by the Participant pursuant to Section 409A.
15. Clawback Policies.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Corporation will be entitled, to the extent permitted or required by applicable law, Corporation policy and/or the requirements of an exchange on which the Corporation's shares are listed for trading, in each case, as in effect from time to time, to recoup compensation of whatever kind paid by the Corporation or any of its Affiliates at any time to a Grantee under this Plan and each Grantee, by accepting an Award pursuant to this Plan, agrees to comply with any Corporation request or demand for such recoupment.
16. Miscellaneous.
 
 
 
 
 
17. Governing Law.
The Plan shall be construed and administered in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its principles of conflicts of law.

ANN INC. issued a Press Release, dated June 6, 2013. A copy of the Press Release is appended to this report as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 
 

Exhibit 99.1
 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 ANN INC. (NYSE: ANN) today reported results for the fiscal first quarter of 2013, ended May 4, 2013. The Company also provided its outlook for the second quarter and the full year of fiscal 2013.
New York, NY, June 6, 2013
For the fiscal first quarter of 2013, the Company reported earnings per diluted share of $0.44 compared with earnings per diluted share of $0.58 in the first quarter of 2012.
Kay Krill, President and CEO commented, "As previously noted, our first quarter performance reflected the impact of unseasonably cold weather, which negatively affected sales of warm weather product, primarily at LOFT. As a result, we were more promotional than planned to clear through inventory in advance of second quarter deliveries.
"The onset of more seasonable weather in May resulted in positive comparable sales performance at both brands and in all channels for the month, and we are on track to achieve higher profitability and positive comp performance at both brands for the second quarter.
"Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to deliver another consecutive year of profitable growth for ANN INC., driven by the success of our strategic initiatives and strong performance at both brands," Ms. Krill concluded.
Total net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were $574.5 million, compared with net sales of $560.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. By brand, net sales across all channels of the Ann Taylor brand totaled $219.3 million in the first quarter of 2013, compared with net sales of $212.4 million in the first quarter of 2012. At the LOFT brand, net sales across all channels were $355.2 million in the first quarter of 2013, compared with net sales of $348.0 million in the first quarter of 2012.
Total Company comparable sales for the quarter decreased 0.5% versus the first quarter of 2012. At Ann Taylor, total brand comparable sales increased 1.9%, reflecting an increase of 6.2% at Ann Taylor, partially offset by a decrease of 5.8% in the Ann Taylor Factory channel. At LOFT, total brand comparable sales decreased 1.9%, reflecting decreases of 0.9% at LOFT and 7.9% at LOFT Outlet.
(Please refer to Table 3 for a breakdown of sales by brand and channel.)
Gross margin, as a percentage of net sales was 55.8%, versus the 56.6% gross margin rate achieved in the first quarter of 2012, reflecting an overall increase in merchandise margin rate, offset by the effect
of higher shipping costs associated with multi-channel sales. The merchandise margin rate improvement reflected stronger performance at Ann Taylor as well as the factory outlet channels for both brands, partially offset by lower performance at LOFT, compared with the first quarter of 2012.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2013 were $286.7 million, versus $272.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2012. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 49.9%, reflecting the impact of increased expenses associated with our year-over-year store growth and increased investments in marketing and other expenses to support the expansion of our business.
The Company reported operating income of $33.9 million for the quarter, compared with operating income of $45.4 million in the first quarter of 2012. Net income for the first quarter was $20.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with net income of $28.7 million, or $0.58 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012.
The Company ended the quarter with approximately $80 million in cash.
Total inventory per square foot at the end of the first quarter increased 6% versus year-ago, reflecting a 3% increase at Ann Taylor, a 13% increase at LOFT and a 3% decrease in the factory/outlet channel. The increase at LOFT reflects the impact of a timing shift in the receipt of a Summer merchandise delivery versus last year.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company opened 13 new stores, comprised of one Ann Taylor store, one Ann Taylor Factory store, nine LOFT stores and two LOFT Outlet stores, and closed three Ann Taylor stores and five LOFT stores. Our total store count at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2013 was 989, comprised of 273 Ann Taylor stores, 516 LOFT stores, 102 Ann Taylor Factory stores and 98 LOFT Outlet stores.
For the fiscal second quarter of 2013, the Company expects total net sales to be $640 million, reflecting a total Company comparable sales increase in the mid-single digits. Gross margin rate performance is expected to be 55.0%. Selling, general and administrative expenses are estimated to approach $300 million.
In terms of the full year, the Company provided the following outlook:
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Company expects to maintain its healthy balance sheet, including a disciplined approach to inventory management throughout the fiscal year.
