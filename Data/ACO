Exhibit 99.1 For further information, contact: Jennifer Melsheimer Investor Relations Manager 847/394-8730 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE:ACO) REPORTS SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, ILL., April 21, 2003--AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE:ACO) today reported first quarter net income of $2.9 million or $0.10 cents per diluted share, compared with $532 thousand or $0.02 cents per diluted share in the same prior-year period. Net sales rose 39 percent to $79.5 million for the period ended March 31, 2003, compared to $57.3 million for the period in 2002. Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer said, "We are pleased to report an increase in sales throughout our major business divisions in both the domestic and international markets over the difficult 2002 first quarter. AMCOL demonstrated leadership in its core markets this quarter, with both our mineral and environmental groups delivering solid gains in both revenue and profit." SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS Minerals The minerals segment, which accounted for approximately 63 percent of AMCOL's consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2003, reported a sales increase of 49 percent, and an operating profit increase of 122 percent over the prior-year period. Washow said, "Approximately 60 percent of the sales increase and 90 percent of the operating profit increase in the minerals segment was generated from our core groups outside of CSM, which was acquired in May 2002. Domestic metalcasting had a positive performance with sales volume improvement over the 2002 quarter. Our Pet Products Group saw not only increased sales over the prior year quarter, but the benefit of significant profit improvement from the ongoing restructuring at our production operations. Export shipments from the U.S. improved over a weak 2002 first quarter and we saw continued improvement in our Asian operations." MORE
AMCOL Q1 2003 EARNINGS Page 2 of 7 Environmental AMCOL's environmental segment, which accounted for 30 percent of the company's consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2003, reported a 27 percent increase in sales and a 154 percent increase in operating profit in year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter. Washow said, "Our environmental segment delivered very good results during the first quarter. Similar to minerals, we experienced improvement in sales and operating profit across a number of business units. Sales were particularly strong in the domestic and international lining technologies markets." Washow commented that the segment's strategy to globalize its business was continuing. He added, "A new production facility near Shanghai, China is on track to start-up in the first quarter of 2004. This will expand our capability for selling lining technology and building materials products in the burgeoning Chinese market." Transportation AMCOL's transportation segment, which accounted for 7 percent of the company's consolidated net sales, reported a 19 percent increase in sales, and a 66 percent increase in operating profit for the 2003 first quarter. Washow noted, "First quarter sales improved with new accounts contributing significantly to the increase. While fuel costs continue to impact results, operational cost controls yielded improved margins." Financial Overview Total short-term and long-term debt was $ 22.3 million at March 31, 2003 compared to $18.2 million at December 31, 2002. Debt represented 12.8 percent of total capitalization at March 31, 2003, compared to 10.7 percent at Dec. 31, 2002. General, selling and administrative expenses were $14.3 million in the 2003 first quarter, an increase of $2.3 million or 19 percent, over the 2002 period. Selling and administrative costs associated with CSM, which was not owned by the Company in the 2002 quarter, were the principal reason for the increase. The Company also incurred higher pension and insurance related expenses in the 2003 quarter. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares of 29.7 million decreased by approximately 1.2 million shares, or approximately 4 percent, from March 31, 2002. MORE

Exhibit 99.1 For further information, contact: Jennifer Melsheimer Investor Relations Manager 847.394.8730 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE:ACO) REPORTS 46 PERCENT INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER PRIOR YEAR QUARTER ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, ILL., July 21, 2003--AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE:ACO) today reported that second quarter income was $5.7 million, or $.19 per diluted share, compared with $4.1 million, or $.13 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. AMCOL reported net sales of $93.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, compared to $78.5 million for the same period in 2002. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2003, net sales were $172.7 million compared to $135.9 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $8.6 million, or $.29 per diluted share, compared with $4.6 million, or $.15 per diluted share in 2002. Larry Washow, president and chief executive officer said, "AMCOL's ability to deliver strong earnings growth has extended to a fifth consecutive quarter. Our financial results reflect improved performance in all of our operating segments. The stronger Euro and British Pound contributed approximately 10 percent of the increase in year-to-date sales and 6 percent of the increase in net income." Washow continued, "Again, our minerals segment registered a notable increase in profitability, largely due to improved margins in our traditional businesses. The environmental segment enjoyed a surge in the European markets, showing growth in both sales and operating profits. Our smallest segment, transportation, has also shown an operating profit upswing which started at the beginning of the year." MORE
AMCOL INTERNATIONAL CORP. Q2 EARNINGS 2003 PAGE 2 OF 9 SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS Minerals The minerals segment, which accounted for approximately 57 percent of consolidated net sales for the second quarter, reported increased sales and operating profit of 19 percent and 37 percent, respectively. In year-over-year comparisons for the first six months, sales increased 32 percent, while operating profit increased 66 percent. Washow noted, "With a sharp focus on the bottom line, we continue to fuel our growth while realizing a significant improvement in our margins. The momentum in this segment has been complimented this quarter by above average performances from both the International and Petroleum Products Groups. In the second quarter Colin Stewart Minchem (CSM) contributed 55 percent to the sales increase and less than 5 percent to the operating profit increase. Our overseas investments in Asia have also been showing a solid return." Washow continued, "By leveraging the investment in our workforce and infrastructure, we were able to achieve strong operating income growth over and above our excellent top line growth." Environmental The Company's environmental segment, which accounted for approximately 36 percent of AMCOL's consolidated net sales for the 2003 quarter, registered a 16 percent increase in operating profit on 21 percent higher sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, compared to the same prior-year period. For the six-month period, operating profit increased 40 percent and sales increased 23 percent from the prior-year period. Washow commented, "This quarter's results prove that we continue to be successful both in our operational initiatives and in our efforts to increase sales. Our environmental increase was due to several business groups' performance with the largest sales escalation coming from the international businesses." Washow continued, "The Lining Technology Group's ability to enter a variety of new markets provides a sales environment which we expect to continue into the third quarter." MORE
AMCOL INTERNATIONAL CORP. Q2 EARNINGS 2003 PAGE 3 OF 9 Transportation AMCOL's transportation operations accounted for approximately 10 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales, including inter-segment shipping revenue, for the current year second quarter. The segment also reported a 16 percent increase in sales and a 74 percent increase in operating profit for the three month period. Sales and operating profits for the six-month period increased 18 percent and 70 percent, respectively. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Total short-term and long-term debt was $ 22.2 million at June 30, 2003 compared to $18.2 million at December 31, 2002. Debt represented 12.2 percent of total capitalization at June 30, 2003, compared to 10.7 percent at December 31, 2002. General, selling and administrative expenses (G,S&A) increased by 16.2 percent for the six-month period and 13.8 percent for the second quarter. The largest component of the increase was CSM, with higher compensation, including expensing stock options, and employee benefit costs also contributing to the higher levels in G,S&A expenses in both reporting periods. The Company elected to adopt the expensing of stock options in the first quarter of 2003. Shares outstanding at June 30, 2003, were approximately 28.3 million compared to approximately 27.9 million in the prior year. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding decreased by 2 and 3 percent for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2003, respectively. AMCOL's financial condition at June 30, 2003, included working capital of approximately $67.6 million and a current ratio of 2.17-to-1, compared to approximately $58.5 million and a current ratio of 2.11-to-1 at December 31, 2002.

Our ongoing cost improvements for our pet products group, have enabled us to deliver better gross margins." Environmental The Company's environmental segment, which accounted for approximately 38 percent of AMCOL's net sales for the third quarter 2003, registered a 20.5 percent increase in operating profit on a 15.2 percent increase in sales as compared with the third quarter of the previous year.

The results were also bolstered by international sales from the U.S. to Latin America." MORE
AMCOL INTERNATIONAL CORP. Q3 EARNINGS 2003 PAGE 3 OF 9 Washow added that two small acquisitions made this quarter in the Building Materials Group have given us the ability to deliver a full "envelope" of building products.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL International (NYSE: ACO) Reports 25 Percent Increase In Fourth Quarter Diluted Earnings Per Share Over 2002 ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., Jan. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE: ACO) today reported its unaudited results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003. Net income was $4.6 million, or $ 0.15 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with $3.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the prior year period, on 3 percent more weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 were $91.8 million compared to $77.8 million for the same period in 2002. Operating profit was $6.4 million compared to $5.3 million in fourth quarters of 2003 and 2002, respectively. "Our success in both the fourth quarter and full year 2003 reflect excellent performance in all of our operating businesses. The minerals segment had a great year both on the domestic front and overseas," said Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer. "Our environmental segment registered record profitability and growth for the year, experiencing the usual fourth quarter challenges." Net income for 2003 was $19.9 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared with $13.0 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the prior year. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares decreased by 1 percent from 2002. Net sales were $364.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, compared to $298.9 million in the prior year. Operating profit was $28.9 million in 2003 compared with $19.7 million in 2002. Washow added, "AMCOL is making progress in a number of areas. Besides strong earnings and cash flow in 2003, we improved our debt position, raised the quarterly dividend, successfully integrated two small environmental acquisitions and have delivered a significant improvement in our global operations." In December 2003 and January 2004, AMCOL International made two acquisitions. The first is a business line and production facility which will provide AMCOL Health & Beauty Solutions manufacturing capability for a wide array of products used in the personal care and cosmetic industries. Washow noted, "While we are pleased with our operating results, the Company must continue to make the strategic investments which will result in future profitable growth. This acquisition further demonstrates our commitment to being the leading supplier of polymeric delivery systems to the personal care industry." The second acquisition is a leading well-testing services company that will complement the environmental segment's current offshore and pipeline services. Washow commented, "The Environmental Offshore Group continues to operate in a very competitive environment. The benefit of the additional services that this acquisition brings allows us a broader customer base for both the new and existing businesses." Washow noted that the nanocomposite segment's alliances with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical and PolyOne continue to move forward. "As the commercial development continues in 2004 we should see the benefit of stronger demand for products incorporating our Nanomer(R)." SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS Minerals The minerals segment, which accounted for approximately 59 percent of consolidated net sales for 2003, reported a sales increase of 26 percent, and a 48 percent increase in operating profit. Fourth quarter sales and operating profits for the minerals segment were up 24 percent and 32 percent, respectively. Washow said, "While there were many highlights during the year, the strength of our U.S. metalcasting sales and improvement in our international performance really stand out. Our customers continue to rely on the high value of our products and technical expertise-meeting our objective of providing value beyond just price. This year, we have also seen the benefits from resolving the operational issues that hurt our pet products performance in 2002." Washow continued, "The success achieved by Colin Stewart Minchem was also evident in this year's mineral sales. This group has expanded their product offering to the broader European market and has witnessed significant growth across a range of products." Environmental The Company's environmental segment, which accounted for approximately 34 percent of AMCOL's consolidated net sales for 2003, registered an operating profit of $17.9 million compared with an operating profit of $14.4 million in 2002, on a sales increase of 17 percent. Washow said, "This year was highlighted by the excellent performance of the environmental segment. Our Lining Technologies Group sales rose to record levels, boosted by the expansion of our product line. We are continuing to benefit from the investments that we have been making worldwide. With our new lining facility coming online in China, we are well positioned for the future growth ahead." Transportation AMCOL's transportation operations, which accounted for approximately 10 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales, including inter-segment shipping revenue, reported a 16 percent increase in sales for the year compared to 2002. Operating profit for 2003 was up 60 percent over the prior year. Washow said, "Expanding business with outside customers and strong sales from our lining technology and pet products groups contributed to the significant rebound in our transportation segment. Although fuel and insurance costs remained high, they were steady throughout the year and improved equipment utilization and productivity contributed to this segment's margin improvements."

Exhibit 99.1 For more information: Jennifer Melsheimer Investor Relations Manager 847/394-8730 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AMCOL INTERNATIONAL CORP. (NYSE:ACO) RECORDS $8.9 MILLION FOR INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS; PREVIOUSLY REPORTED 2003 YEAR-END UNAUDITED RESULTS TO BE REVISED ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, ILL., Feb. 25, 2004-- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE:ACO) today announced that it will revise its previously reported unaudited results for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2003 to include $8.9 million of income from discontinued operations, or $0.29 per diluted share for the fourth quarter and $0.30 per diluted share for the full year. The revision to earnings is associated with a reduction of the Company's estimated income taxes payable related to its discontinued U.K. metalcasting business, which was sold in 2001. This reduction was determined upon the completion of the audits of the Company's federal income tax return for years through 2001 by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Those audits resulted in an actual tax liability that was lower than the estimate of taxes payable related to those periods. The IRS notified the Company, via a letter sent February 18, 2004, that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation had completed a review of their report in connection with its examination of the Company's federal income tax returns for the years through 2001. The Committee agreed with the conclusions in the report and, as a result, the Company adjusted its estimate of taxes payable to reflect the actual amount due as of Dec. 31, 2003, based upon the IRS report.

AMCOL INTERNATIONAL CORP. INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS PAGE 2 OF 2 The Company will revise 2003 fourth quarter and year-end unaudited results originally reported on Jan. 20, 2004. The Company will report fourth quarter 2003 net income of $13.6 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared with the $4.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share previously reported. Full-year results for 2003 will be revised to net income of $28.9 million or $0.97 per diluted share, compared with the $19.9 million or $0.67 per diluted share previously reported.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL International (NYSE: ACO) Reports 60 Percent Increase in First Quarter Diluted Earnings Per Share Over 2003 First Quarter ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., April 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE: ACO) today reported 2004 first quarter net income of $5.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared with $2.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. Net sales rose 28 percent to $102.0 million for the period ended March 31, 2004, compared to $79.5 million for the period in 2003. Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer said, "We are pleased that the first quarter of the new year continued our growth across the Company. Our mineral and environmental segments show double-digit increases in both revenues and operating profit. Growth for the quarter was broad-based across geographic locations and product portfolios, highlighted by strong sales in our minerals segment and excellent European environmental sales." Washow noted, "Stronger foreign currencies, primarily the Euro and British Pound, contributed approximately $0.01 per share of the increase in earnings. Recent acquisitions also accounted for approximately $0.01 per share of earnings." SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS Minerals The minerals segment, which accounted for approximately 63 percent of AMCOL's consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2004, reported a sales increase of 28 percent, and an operating profit increase of 51 percent over the prior-year period. Washow said, "The first quarter results demonstrate our continued success in growing key areas of our business. Our Metalcasting Products Group, 45 percent of the mineral segment's sales, showed improvement as sales of both traditional product lines and our briquette product line drove top-line revenue growth for our minerals segment. Several of our Asia Pacific mineral operations performed very well in the first quarter, due to the rise in the Asian foundry sector. Our Pet Products Group had strong bulk and packaged product sales. Our Specialty Minerals Group also had a good quarter with our U.K.-based detergent business continued its strong performance and the health & beauty business operating results improved this quarter due to the acquisition completed at the end of 2003." Environmental AMCOL's environmental segment, which accounted for 31 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2004, reported a 35 percent increase in sales and a 29 percent increase in operating profit in year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter. Washow commented, "In the past, the first quarter has been slow for our environmental segment. With our current globalization strategy in place our European environmental business remains focused on controlled and sustainable growth leading this segment's sales for the quarter. The acquisition of Linteco also added to our top-line growth." Washow continued, "In our domestic businesses, the Building Materials Group continued to perform well. The Lining Technologies Group has maintained its leading position in the domestic market and continues to concentrate on new lining opportunities. Our Water Treatment Group is starting to see the synergistic effect derived from the LaFayette Well Testing acquisition in terms of combined services on several projects." Transportation AMCOL's transportation segment, which accounted for 9 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales, including inter-segment shipping revenue, reported a 6 percent increase in sales, and a 3 percent increase in operating profit for the 2004 first quarter. Washow noted, "High demand and equipment utilization contributed to our transportation segment's first quarter sales, but continued increases in fuel costs adversely impacted margins and operating profit." FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Long-term debt amounted to $29.7 million at March 31, 2004 compared to $9.0 million at December 31, 2003. Debt represented 14 percent of total capitalization at March 31, 2004, compared to 5.1 percent at December 31, 2003. Cash and cash equivalents were $10.4 million at March 31, 2004 compared with $13.5 million at the end of 2003. General, selling and administrative expenses were $17.3 million in the 2004 first quarter, an increase of $3.0 million or 21 percent, over the 2003 period. Expenses were higher primarily due to increased compensations and benefit costs. Selling and administrative expenses associated with businesses acquired during the first quarter of 2004 also contributed to the increase. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares of 31.0 million increased by approximately 1.2 million shares, or approximately 4 percent, from March 31, 2003. During the first quarter of 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 12,000 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $196,300, or an average price of $15.83 per share. Approximately $3.5 million remains available in the stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2002. AMCOL's financial condition at March 31, 2004 included working capital of approximately $106.5 million and a current ratio of 3.0-to-1 compared to approximately $91.9 million and a ratio of 3.0-to-1 at December 31, 2003.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL International (NYSE: ACO) Reports 32 Percent Increase in Second Quarter Diluted Earnings Per Share Over 2003 Second Quarter ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., July 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE: ACO) today reported that second quarter net income was $7.7 million, or $.25 per diluted share, compared with $5.7 million, or $.19 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. AMCOL reported net sales of $117.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to $93.3 million for the same period in 2003. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2004, net sales were $219.0 million compared to $172.7 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $12.8 million, or $.42 per diluted share, compared with $8.6 million, or $.29 per diluted share in the same period of 2003. Larry Washow, president and chief executive officer said, "While there were many highlights in the quarter impacting the results, growth in our traditional markets in the U.S. and strong international performance really stand out. Our second-quarter results continue several quarters of year-over-year improvement. We are focused on leveraging our established competitive positions and creating additional future growth through our new product developments as well as acquisitions." Washow noted, "Acquisitions and favorable foreign exchange rates each accounted for approximately $.01 per share of the earnings improvement in the second quarter. Those categories each accounted for $.02 per share of the increase in earnings for the six month period." SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS Minerals The minerals segment, which accounted for approximately 57 percent of consolidated net sales for the second quarter, reported increased sales and operating profit of 24 percent and 40 percent, respectively. In year-over-year comparisons for the first six months, sales increased 26 percent, while operating profit increased 45 percent. Washow noted, "We are encouraged by continued demand in both the U.S. and Asia/Pacific metalcasting markets. Automotive sales remain brisk, while additional business from increased rail car and farm equipment production contributed further to the top line." Washow continued, "Higher sales in our specialty minerals group, in particular our detergent products, coupled with continued improvement in gross margin, contributed to the minerals segment's strong results for the quarter." Environmental The Company's environmental segment, which accounted for approximately 38 percent of AMCOL's consolidated net sales for the 2004 second quarter, registered a 16 percent increase in operating profit on 32 percent higher sales for the quarter ended June 30, 2004, compared to the same prior-year period. For the six-month period, operating profit increased 20 percent and sales increased 33 percent from the prior-year period. Washow commented, "The lining technologies group again delivered substantial sales growth including our recent European acquisition, which has expanded our marketshare for the environmental segment in Spain." Washow noted, "The segment's gross profit margin declined in comparison with the second quarter of 2003 due to the relatively lower profit earned on sales from businesses acquired in the past year." Transportation AMCOL's transportation operations accounted for approximately 9 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales, including inter-segment shipping revenue, for the current year second quarter. The segment also reported a 7 percent increase in sales and a 13 percent increase in operating profit for the three-month period. Sales and operating profits for the six-month period increased 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively. Washow commented, "High demand and improved equipment utilization contributed to higher second quarter sales, while improvement in pricing offset higher fuel costs." FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Long-term debt amounted to $31.3 million at June 30, 2004, compared to $9.0 million at December 31, 2003. Debt represented 14.0 percent of total capitalization at June 30, 2004, compared to 5.1 percent at December 31, 2003. The increase in debt was due to recent acquisitions and increases in working capital. Cash and cash equivalents were $16.0 million at June 30, 2004, compared with $13.5 million at the end of 2003. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding at June 30, 2004, were 30.9 million compared to approximately 29.8 million in the prior year. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased by 3.1 and 3.74 percent for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2004, respectively. AMCOL's financial condition at June 30, 2004, included working capital of approximately $111.0 million and a current ratio of 2.9-to-1, compared to approximately $91.9 million and a current ratio of 3.0-to-1 at December 31, 2003. Accounts receivable increased to $86.6 million at June 30, 2004 compared with $61 million at December 31, 2003. This increase is commensurate with growth in sales and greater European accounts receivable. Through the first six months of 2004, AMCOL repurchased 183,400 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $2.9 million, or an average price of $15.70 per share.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL International (NYSE: ACO) Reports 23 Percent Increase in Diluted Earnings Per Share Over Prior Year Third Quarter ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., Oct. 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE: ACO) today reported that third quarter net income was $8.3 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, compared with $6.6 million, or $.22 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. The 2004 third quarter, as compared with the prior year's third quarter, was positively impacted by approximately $0.02 per diluted share due to a lower effective income tax rate. AMCOL reported net sales of $121.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, compared to $99.5 million for the same period in 2003. Operating profit grew to $11.6 million compared with $9.9 million in the prior-year period. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004, net income was $21.1 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared with $15.3 million, or $.51 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net sales for the nine- month period were $340.5 million compared to $272.2 million in the prior-year period. Operating profit was $30.0 million compared with $22.5 million for the 2003 period. Larry Washow, president and chief executive officer, said, "Earnings in the third quarter were held back by adverse weather conditions in the Southeastern United States. While these circumstances affected the performance in a number of environmental markets, the business prospects going forward are quite positive." Washow continued, "Even after considering the impact weather has had on earnings, AMCOL is delivering on its plans of improved profitability and top- line growth-posting a 25 percent increase in year-over-year nine-month revenues. Results for our minerals segment were the bright spot for the third quarter, in part related to the continued strong business levels in metalcasting despite the announced slow-down in U.S. automotive production." Washow added, "We are also making measurable progress building a broader customer base and moving toward revenue mixes which we expect will drive long- term growth in our Specialty Minerals Group." Washow noted that AMCOL has recently completed the purchase of a plant in Cartersville, Ga. from Unilever for $4.1 million. The plant will be used initially for consolidation of several environmental operations in the Southeastern U.S. SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS Minerals The minerals segment, which accounted for approximately 55 percent of consolidated net sales for the 2004 third quarter, reported a net sales increase of approximately 22 percent, and approximately a 34 percent increase in operating profit over the prior-year period. In year-over-year comparisons for the first nine months, net sales increased approximately 24 percent, while operating profit increased approximately 41 percent. Environmental The Company's environmental segment, which accounted for approximately 39 percent of AMCOL's net sales for the third quarter 2004, registered approximately a 3 percent decrease in operating profit on approximately a 25 percent increase in net sales as compared with the third quarter of the previous year. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2004, operating profit increased approximately 9 percent while net sales increased approximately 30 percent from the prior-year period. Transportation AMCOL's transportation segment accounted for approximately 9 percent of the Company's net sales, including inter-segment shipping revenue, for the current year third quarter. The segment reported approximately a 10 percent increase in operating profit, and approximately a 6 percent increase in net sales in year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004, the segment reported a net sales increase of approximately 6 percent, and an increase in operating profit of approximately 9 percent from the prior-year period. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Long-term debt amounted to $29.8 million at September 30, 2004 compared to $9.0 at December 31, 2003. Debt represented 13 percent of total capitalization at September 30, 2004, compared to 5 percent at December 31, 2003. The increase in debt relates to acquisitions and increases in working capital. Cash and cash equivalents were $12.9 million at September 30, 2004, compared with $13.5 million at the end of 2003. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding at September 30, 2004 was 30.8 million compared to approximately 29.8 million at the end of the prior year. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding remained the same and increased three percent for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2004, respectively. AMCOL's financial condition at September 30, 2004 included working capital of approximately $116.2 million and a current ratio of 3.0-to-1, compared to approximately $91.9 million and a current ratio of 3.0-to-1 at December 31, 2003. Accounts receivable increased to $88.3 million at September 30, 2004 compared with $61.0 million at December 31, 2003. This increase is commensurate with growth in sales and acquisitions. AMCOL did not repurchase any Company stock in the third quarter of 2004. Through the first nine months of 2004, AMCOL repurchased 183,400 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $2.9 million, or an average price of $15.70 per share.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE: ACO) REPORTS 34 PERCENT INCREASE IN FOURTH QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OVER 2003 ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., Jan. 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE: ACO) today reported its unaudited results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. Income from continuing operations was $6.3 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with $4.6 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the prior year period. As compared with the prior year's fourth quarter, the 2004 fourth quarter was positively impacted by approximately $0.04 per diluted share from continuing operations due to a lower effective income tax rate. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, including the footnote detailing the reclassification of certain amounts for the 2003 periods to conform to the current year presentation. Net sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $111.6 million compared to $93.6 million for the same period in 2003. Operating profit was $7.1 million compared to $6.4 million in the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003, respectively. Income from continuing operations for 2004 was $27.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared with $19.9 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the prior year. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares increased by 3 percent from 2003. Net sales were $458.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with $372.0 million in the prior year. Operating profit was $37.0 million in 2004 compared with $28.9 million in 2003. "AMCOL International completed a very good year, with sales in excess of $450 million and operating profit of $37 million, increases of approximately 23 percent and 28 percent respectively over 2003. While it is gratifying to have achieved these results, our operating profit increase from continuing operations in the fourth quarter did not keep pace with our increase in sales revenues," said Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer. "This resulted in part from the increase in raw material, energy and transportation costs. It is our objective, however, to achieve earnings growth in excess of sales growth as we go forward." Washow noted, "Our minerals segment continued to be AMCOL's largest sales producer with 57 percent of our 2004 total. Metalcasting remains our largest group with increased sales in the face of a stable U.S. market. This group continued to expand globally in our traditional market, but as a leader in the metalcasting industry, product line expansion is a natural stepping stone to furthering this group's sales." Washow added, "Also in the minerals segment, our detergent group had a weaker fourth quarter as customer product changes impacted our revenues. Margins in the pet products group were also down as packaging and freight costs negatively impacted our results."
Washow continued, "Our environmental segment enjoyed another year of growth, reaching a new level of profitability and sales. With European operations as a major contributor, the environmental segment benefited from internal growth as well as the European lining technology acquisition made in the first quarter of 2004, which contributed immediately to our top line and positioned us for further growth." Washow said, "Our lining technologies and building materials groups continue to grow their market presence around the world. Demand within our targeted markets, technology introductions and increasing performance for our environmental products and services have led to another very positive year for these groups. The oilfield services group did not meet expectations, being hampered in part by the transition of the acquisition completed in early 2004. Critically important to this group's future growth are sales of improved filtration technology to offshore production platforms and onshore pipelines." Washow noted that AMCOL's transportation segment also completed a strong year, in spite of increased diesel fuel costs. Washow concluded, "We have set clear, attainable goals for 2005. With our solid foundation in diverse products and our aggressive global penetration, we expect AMCOL's returns should continue to grow." Net income was $6.3 million, or $ 0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with $13.6 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, in the prior year period. The 2003 fourth quarter included $8.9 million of income from discontinued operations, or $0.29 per diluted share. Net income for 2004 was $27.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared with $28.9 million or $0.97 per diluted share, for the prior year. Net income for 2003 includes $8.9 million of income from discontinued operations, or $0.30 per diluted share. This income resulted from income tax benefits relating to the Company's discontinued U.K. metalcasting business that was sold in 2001. SEGMENT DISCUSSIONS Minerals The minerals segment, which accounted for approximately 57 percent of consolidated net sales for 2004, reported a sales increase of 21 percent, and a 29 percent increase in operating profit. Fourth quarter sales and operating profits for the minerals segment were up 13 percent and down 1 percent, respectively. Environmental The Company's environmental segment, which accounted for approximately 37 percent of AMCOL's consolidated net sales for 2004, registered an operating profit of $20.8 million compared with an operating profit of $17.9 million in 2003, on a sales increase of 30 percent. Transportation AMCOL's transportation operations, which accounted for approximately 9 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales, including inter-segment shipping revenue, reported an 8 percent increase in sales for the year compared to 2003. Operating profit for 2004 was up 11 percent over the prior year.
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Total long-term and short-term debt amounted to $34.3 million at December 31, 2004, compared with $9.0 million at December 31, 2003. Debt was 14 percent of total capitalization as of December 31, 2004, compared with 4.7 percent as of December 31, 2003. Cash and cash equivalents were $17.6 million at the end of 2004 compared with $13.5 million in 2003. For the year 2004, general, selling and administrative expenses were 17 percent of net sales compared with 18 percent in 2003. In the fourth quarter, general, selling and administrative expenses for the environmental segment were reduced by approximately $1.2 million due to a change in the estimate of a long-term incentive compensation accrual. Also in this quarter, as further detailed in the unaudited financial statements accompanying this earnings release, the Company changed its classification of commissions earned by independent sales representatives from a sales deduction to general, selling and administrative expenses. Net interest expense for 2004 was $0.8 million compared with $0.3 million in the previous year. Shares outstanding at December 31, 2004, were approximately 29.4 million compared with approximately 29.1 million at December 31, 2003. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased by 3 percent for the full year and remained the same during the fourth quarter of 2004. For the year, the Company repurchased approximately 183 thousand shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $2.9 million, or an average price of $15.70 per share. Approximately $10 million remains available in the stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2004. AMCOL's financial condition at December 31, 2004, included working capital of approximately $122.5 million and a current ratio of 3.0-to-1. Working capital was $87.0 million and the current ratio was 2.7-to-1 at December 31, 2003.

ITEM 2.02 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. On March 15, 2005, AMCOL International Corporation (sometimes referred to in this Report as the "Company") issued a press release (i) reporting that the Company expects to restate the financial results reported in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as amended, for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 due to an understatement of net income during such period, (ii) reporting revisions to its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004, previously reported in the Company's press release, dated January 18, 2005, (iii) indicating that the Company will report a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting in its Annual Report on Form 10-K resulting from points (i) & (ii), and (iv) reporting that the Company is filing a Form 12b-25 to report the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. A copy of the Company's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference. ITEM 4.02 NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW. (a) In its March 15, 2005 press release, referenced in Item 2.02 above, the Company announced that it expects to restate prior financial results. Specifically, on March 9, 2005, the audit committee of the Company's board of directors concluded that previously issued financial information contained in (i) the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2004, as originally filed on November 8, 2004 and as amended on November 9, 2004, and (ii) the Company's press release, dated January 18, 2005, titled "AMCOL International Reports 34 Percent Increase in Fourth Quarter Diluted Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Over 2003" should not be relied upon because of errors arising from the understatement of net income during its third quarter of 2004. The Company's audit committee and senior management discussed the matter disclosed in this report with KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In September 2004, the Company filed amended federal income tax returns for the 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax years. The amended federal tax returns seek additional refunds for the 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax years on the basis of changes in certain deductions and credits allowed in those years, partly carried back to 1996 (the "Claimed Deduction and Credit Calculation Refunds"). The total amount of refunds sought by the Company in connection with the Claimed Deduction and Credit Calculation Refunds is $5.2 million. Previously, the management of the Company did not recognize any net income in connection with the filing of the amended federal tax returns because it believed that any potential gain was contingent upon various factors which precluded assessing the likelihood of a refund as probable. In connection with the preparation of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, the management of the Company has determined that this belief was erroneous and that that it is probable that the Company will recover at least $4.0 million as a result of the Claimed Deduction and Credit Calculation Refunds. Therefore, the Company is required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to recognize an income tax receivable of $4.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2004 as a result of the Claimed Deduction and Credit Calculation Refunds. Because management considers it
appropriate to record an income tax receivable, it has also determined that an accrual should be recorded for estimated professional accounting fees of $1.2 million ($0.8 million net of taxes) associated with the Claimed Deduction and Credit Calculation Refunds. The net effect of recording the income tax receivable and the professional accounting fees accrual is an increase of $3.2 million in net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. In addition, the Company has determined that it is necessary to make certain adjustments correcting the deferred income tax assets and income taxes payable by a wholly-owned Company subsidiary in the United Kingdom (the "UK Tax Adjustments"). These adjustments include an increase in retained earnings by $1.0 million and a reduction of the Company's income tax expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 by $1.1 million, which in turn increases the Company's net income for such period by an equal amount. Accordingly, the Company expects to restate its financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 to reflect the foregoing, resulting in additional net income of $4.3 million and an increase in retained earnings of $1.0 million. The Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission an amended quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A for such period. The Company expects to file such amended quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A no later than March 31, 2005. The foregoing corrections are also reflected in its revised discussion of financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004 reported in the Company's press release dated March 15, 2005 attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. The discussion of the Company's revised financial results contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K and the attached press release has been prepared by management and represents management's preliminary assessment of the revised results and has not been audited or reviewed by KPMG LLP. Actual revised financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 will be included in the Company's amended quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A for such period. Audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004 will be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's management is in the process of assessing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The fact that the Company will restate its financial statements as described above is indicative of a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, management will report a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 with respect to control over accounting for income taxes, when it completes the assessment required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS. Adjustment of Retained Earnings The amended federal tax returns referenced in Item 4.02 above also seek a refund for the 2000 tax year as a result of the Company's inadvertent failure to deduct certain state taxes paid in connection with the gain realized on the Company's sale of its Chemdal super-absorbent polymer business in 2000 (the "Claimed State Tax Deduction Refund"). The total amount of refunds sought by the Company in connection with the Claimed State Tax Deduction Refund is $5.6 million.
Previously, the management of the Company did not recognize any net income in connection with the filing of the amended federal tax returns because it believed that any potential gain was contingent upon various factors which precluded assessing the likelihood of a refund as probable. In connection with the preparation of its Annual Report on Form 10-K, the management of the Company has determined that this belief was erroneous and that it is probable that the Company will recover $5.6 million as a result of the Claimed State Tax Deduction Refund. Therefore, the Company is required to increase its retained earnings for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 by $5.6 million as a result of the Claimed State Tax Deduction Refund. The Company will include in the restated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 the increase in its third quarter retained earnings from $140.0 million to $146.6 million due to the Claimed State Tax Deduction Refund and the UK Adjustment discussed above. In addition, during the review and investigation of the Claimed Deduction and Credit Calculation Refunds, UK Tax Adjustments and Claimed State Tax Deduction Refund, the Company has determined that certain other nonmaterial adjustments, reclassifications and revised accounting estimates are appropriate to include in its restated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 and its revised discussion of financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. As noted in Item 4.02 above, the discussion of the Company's revised financial results contained in this Current Report on Form 8-K and the attached press release has been prepared by management and represents management's preliminary assessment of the revised results and has not been audited or reviewed by KPMG LLP. Actual revised financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 will be included in the Company's amended quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A for such period. Audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004 will be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. Delay in Filing Form 10-K As a result of the time and resources being devoted by the Company's management to the restatement of the Company's financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company has been unable to devote sufficient resources to timely provide to KPMG LLP all materials necessary to complete the audit of the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. Although the Company is diligently working with KPMG LLP in the performance of its audit, it recently became
clear that the Company will not be able to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K in a timely manner. Accordingly, the Company is filing a Form 12b-25 to report the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which the Company expects to file on or prior to March 31, 2005. ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS (c) Exhibits. 99.1 Press Release titled "AMCOL International (NYSE: ACO) Reports Increase in Net Income for Third Quarter 2004 Results, Restatement of Third Quarter 2004 Financial Statements, Material Weakness in Internal Control resulting from the restatement and Delay in Filing Annual Report on Form 10-K" dated MXarch 15, 2005.
SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized. AMCOL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION Date: March 15, 2005 By: /s/ Lawrence E.Washow ------------------------------------- Lawrence E. Washow President and Chief Executive Officer

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE: ACO) REPORTS INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THIRD QUARTER 2004 RESULTS, RESTATEMENT OF THIRD QUARTER 2004 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN INTERNAL CONTROLS RESULTING FROM THE RESTATEMENT AND DELAY IN FILING ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., March 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) today announced that its net income reported in its third quarter 2004 financial statements was understated due to the failure to recognize expected federal income tax refunds relating to certain deductions and credits and the failure to make certain adjustments to deferred income tax assets and income taxes payable by a wholly-owned Company subsidiary in the United Kingdom. As a result, AMCOL International Corporation (the "Company") will restate its third quarter 2004 financial statements and is revising its previously-released unaudited results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004. The Company also reported that it will report a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting and that it is filing a Form 12b-25 to report the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. RESTATEMENT OF THIRD QUARTER 2004 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In September 2004, the Company filed amended federal income tax returns for the 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 tax years seeking refunds on the basis of changes in certain deductions and credits allowed in those years, partly carried back to 1996. The Company has determined, in consultation with its independent registered public accounting firm, that its failure to recognize the probable refund was incorrect. The Company has determined that the refund of at least $4.0 million is probable and should be recognized as an income tax receivable, although it has also determined that an accrual should be recorded for estimated professional tax accounting fees of $1.2 million ($0.8 million net of taxes) associated with pursuing such refund. The Company has also determined that it is necessary to make certain adjustments correcting the deferred income tax assets and income taxes payable by a Company subsidiary in the United Kingdom. These adjustments include an increase in retained earnings by $1.0 million and a reduction of the Company's income tax expense for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 by $1.1 million, which in turn increases the Company's net income for such period by an equal amount. Due to the foregoing adjustments, the Company is increasing net income by $4.3 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2004 (from the $8.3 million originally reported to $12.6 million) and in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004 (from the $21.1 million originally reported to $25.4 million). This corresponds to an increase of $0.14 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2004 (from the $0.27 per diluted share originally reported to $0.41 per diluted share) and in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2004 (from the $0.69 per diluted share originally reported to $0.83 per diluted share).
As a result, the Company will file an amended quarterly report on Form 10- Q/A for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 restating its third quarter financial statements. Therefore, the previously-issued financial statements contained in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as originally filed on November 8, 2004 and as amended on November 9, 2004, should no longer be relied upon. The Company expects to file such amended quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A no later than March 31, 2005. In addition, the amended federal income tax return for the 2000 tax year seeks an additional refund as a result of the Company's failure to deduct certain state taxes paid in connection with the gain realized on the Company's sale of its Chemdal super-absorbent polymer business in 2000. The Company has now determined that it is required to include a prior period adjustment in its third quarter financial statements increasing its retained earnings by $5.6 million to reflect the probable refund resulting from such additional state tax deductions. This adjustment to retained earnings, together with the $1.0 million adjustment to retained earnings resulting from the tax adjustments in the United Kingdom discussed above, increased its third quarter retained earnings from $140.0 million to $146.6 million, and the Company will include the change in its restated third quarter financial statements. In addition, during the review and investigation of the above-referenced matters, the Company has determined that certain other nonmaterial adjustments, reclassifications and revised accounting estimates are appropriate to include in its restated financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2004. Larry Washow, the Company's president and chief executive officer, commented that "most of the issues relate to tax calculations from the 2000 sale of the superabsorbents business. This was a $650 million transaction generating income taxes in excess of $200 million. We have reviewed the federal and state and international income tax filings and have identified several areas where we believe there are opportunities to recover some of the money that was paid. Additionally, working with outside experts, we also believe that other taxes paid in the past several years can be reduced by using other appropriate methods of calculating the taxes." REVISION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END UNAUDITED FINANCIAL INFORMATION The foregoing corrections also require the revision of the Company's unaudited results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2004, which were previously released in the Company's press release, dated January 18, 2005, titled "AMCOL International Reports 34 Percent Increase in Fourth Quarter Diluted Earnings Per Share From Continuing Operations Over 2003." As a result, these previously released results and the related discussion in the Company's January 18, 2005 press release should no longer be relied upon.
As revised, net income for 2004 was $31.8 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with $28.9 million or $0.97 per diluted share, for the prior year. Net income for 2003 included $8.9 million of income from discontinued operations, or $0.30 per diluted share. This income resulted from income tax benefits relating to the Company's discontinued U.K. metalcasting business that was sold in 2001. Income from continuing operations for 2004 was $31.8 million, or $1.03 per diluted share, compared with $19.9 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for the prior year. The discussion of revised financial results contained in this release has been prepared by management and represents management's preliminary assessment of the revised results and has not been audited or reviewed by KPMG LLP. Actual revised financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 will be included in the Company's amended quarterly report on Form 10-Q/A for such period. Audited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2004 will be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K. INTERNAL CONTROL AND DELAY IN FILING ANNUAL REPORT The Company's management is in the process of assessing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The fact that the Company will restate its financial statements as described above is indicative of a material weakness in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, management will report a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, with respect to controls over accounting for income taxes, when it completes the assessment required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result of the time and resources being devoted by the Company's management to the restatement of the Company's financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2004, the Company has been unable to devote sufficient resources to timely provide to KPMG LLP all materials necessary to complete the audit of the Company's financial statements financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004. Although the Company is diligently working with KPMG LLP in the performance of its audit, it recently became clear that the Company will not be able to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K in a timely manner. Accordingly, the Company is filing a Form 12b-25 to report the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K, which the Company expects to file on or prior to March 31, 2005. This release contains certain forward-looking statements regarding the Company's expected performance for future periods and actual results for such periods might materially differ. Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, actual growth in the Company's various markets, utilization of the Company's plants, currency exchange rates, currency devaluation, delays in development, production and marketing of new products, integration of acquired businesses, and other factors detailed from time to time in the Company's annual report and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE: ACO) REPORTS 44 PERCENT INCREASE IN FIRST QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER 2004 FIRST QUARTER ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., April 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE: ACO) today reported 2005 first quarter net income of $7.0 million or $0.23 per diluted share, compared with $5.1 million or $.16 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. Net sales rose 17 percent to $122.1 million for the period ended March 31, 2005, compared to $104.2 million for the period in 2004. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer said, "The first quarter of 2005 has been challenging, but one in which we delivered strong earnings growth. AMCOL is pleased by our environmental segment's improved margins this quarter. We have seen improvement in several of the markets that were difficult last year. Also a contributor to this segment's operating margin improvement was our oilfield services group, which is now performing closer to our original expectations." Washow noted, "In our minerals segment, net sales increased, but we did not see a similar operating profit increase. We are in the midst of adjusting selling prices to reflect the continuing cost escalation of raw materials, energy and transportation. The highlight of the minerals group was our Asia Pacific operations, which reported not only strong sales, but good operating margins as well." "Another positive during the quarter was the contribution from our overseas joint ventures. These investments, particularly in India and Japan, contributed $0.02 per share to earnings this quarter, up from less than $0.01 in 2004. Earnings were also positively impacted by $0.03 per share due to a lower effective tax rate," Washow commented. Washow continued, "During the first quarter, we have felt significant pressures on our selling, general and administrative costs arising from the impact of Sarbanes-Oxley, increased compensation and benefits, and mineral development expenditures. We will continue to evaluate our selling, general and administrative expenses, aligning them with our expectations for revenue growth." FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Long-term debt amounted to $42.1 million at March 31, 2005 compared to $34.3 million at December 31, 2004. Debt represented 16 percent of total capitalization at March 31, 2005, compared to 13 percent at December 31, 2004. Cash and cash equivalents were $19.5 million at March 31, 2005 compared with $17.6 million at the end of 2004. General, selling and administrative expenses were $21.4 million in the 2005 first quarter, an increase of $2.0 million or 10 percent over the 2004 period. The Company's effective tax rate was 19.1 percent for the first quarter of 2005 versus 31.5 percent for the same period in 2004. The change in the rate favorably impacted earnings by $0.03 per share, and largely resulted from changes in estimates of taxes owed. Had these changes in estimates not been made, the effective tax rate would have been 26.5 percent for the first quarter of 2005. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares of 30.8 million decreased by approximately 217 thousand shares, or approximately 1 percent, from March 31, 2004. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company paid approximately $1.6 million to former owners of acquired businesses. The payments were owed because the operating performance of the businesses met profit targets included in earn-out provisions included in the purchase agreements. During the first quarter of 2005, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock. $10 million remains available in the stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2004.
AMCOL's financial condition at March 31, 2005 included working capital of approximately $139.7 million and a current ratio of 3.3-to-1 compared to approximately $129.4 million and a ratio of 3.1-to-1 at December 31, 2004. Minerals The minerals segment, which accounted for approximately 60 percent of AMCOL's consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2005, reported a sales increase of 14 percent and an operating profit increase of 5 percent over the prior-year period. Environmental AMCOL's environmental segment, which accounted for 35 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales for the first quarter of 2005, reported a 26 percent increase in sales and a 67 percent increase in operating profit in year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter. Transportation AMCOL's transportation segment, which accounted for 9 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales, including inter-segment shipping revenue, reported an 18 percent increase in sales and a 48 percent increase in operating profit for the 2005 first quarter. This release contains certain forward-looking statements regarding AMCOL's expected performance for future periods and actual results for such periods might materially differ. Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, actual growth in AMCOL's various markets, utilization of AMCOL's plants, currency exchange rates, currency devaluation, delays in development, production and marketing of new products, integration of acquired businesses, and other factors detailed from time to time in AMCOL's annual report and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1) Net sales in periods prior to the quarter ended March 31, 2005 were reported net of certain deductions relating to product liability, warranty and royalty expenses. Effective for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, these deductions are included in general, selling, and administrative expenses. Thus, for the quarter ended March 31, 2004, these deductions have been reclassified to conform to the current year accounting presentation. This change in accounting presentation did not impact reported net income or earnings per share.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE: ACO) REPORTS 24 PERCENT INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OVER 2004 SECOND QUARTER AND INCOME OF $0.15 FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., July 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE: ACO) today reported that second quarter net income was $14.3 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. Earnings from continuing operations were $9.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $7.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. AMCOL reported net sales of $136.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2005, compared with $119.8 million for the same period in 2004. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the financial overview. The Company also reported a gain from discontinued operations of $0.15 per diluted share reflecting a state income tax refund associated with the absorbent polymers segment that was sold in the second quarter of 2000. Larry Washow, president and chief executive officer, said, "The sustained growth in our major market segments, mineral and environmental, is shown in AMCOL's current financial results. We continue to incur significant expenses to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley. Additionally, the strengthening of the dollar during the second quarter had a negative impact on earnings." For the six-month period ended June 30, 2005, net sales were $258.4 million compared to $223.9 million in the prior-year period. Net income was $21.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared with $12.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share in the same period of 2004. Washow commented, "In our minerals segment, our metalcasting group saw revenue and profit increases despite the continuing cost pressure. This group has witnessed solid demand from the automotive sector and strong demand from the heavy equipment sectors. Our pet products group operated in a difficult environment with upward pressure on packaging material costs and continued increases in shipping costs. The international business continues to grow, with our China operations having a record quarter." Washow noted, "Revenues in our environmental segment continue to be strong. The growth in our oilfield services group demonstrates our ability to attract customers with innovative products and to make accretive acquisitions that add to growth. Lining technology and building material sales continue to be healthy, both domestically and overseas. We are encouraged by the accelerating global sales contributions in the environmental segment, especially our Asian operations." FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Gross profit for the quarter benefited from legislation enacted by the State of Montana exempting certain minerals, including bentonite, in the state during 2004. As a result of the legislation, the Company recorded a $1.9 million reduction to cost of goods sold in its mineral segment in the second quarter.
General, selling and administrative expenses were $23.1 million in the 2005 second quarter, an increase of $2.6 million or 13 percent over the 2004 period. Approximately $1.0 million of the increase is associated with professional fees related to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and report on internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company expects the costs for professional services relating to external audit services and Sarbanes - Oxley compliance to be approximately $0.4 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Stock compensation costs accounted for approximately $0.2 million of the increase over the second quarter 2004 period. The Company's effective tax rate was 24.5 percent for the second quarter of 2005 versus 31.5 percent for the same period in 2004. The tax rate in 2005 has benefited from higher estimated depletion deductions and greater income earned from foreign countries, which usually have lower statutory income tax rates. Other expense includes approximately $0.9 million in foreign exchange losses due to the strengthening U.S. dollar, particularly against the British Pound and Euro. During the first half of 2005, the Company did not repurchase any of its common stock; $10 million remains available in the stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2004. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding at June 30, 2005 was 30.8 million compared to approximately 30.9 million in the prior year. Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding decreased less than 1 percent for both the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2005, respectively. Long-term debt amounted to $44.6 million at June 30, 2005, compared with $34.3 million at December 31, 2004. Debt represented 16 percent of total capitalization at June 30, 2005, compared with 13 percent at December 31, 2004. Cash and cash equivalents were $14.4 million at June 30, 2005, compared with $17.6 million at the end of 2004. AMCOL's financial condition at June 30, 2005, included working capital of approximately $152.3 million and a current ratio of 3.8-to-1, compared to approximately $129.4 million and a current ratio of 3.1-to-1 at December 31, 2004. AMCOL International Corporation, headquartered in Arlington Heights, Ill., produces and markets a wide range of specialty mineral products used for industrial, environmental and consumer-related applications. AMCOL is the parent of American Colloid Co., CETCO (Colloid Environmental Technologies Co.), Volclay International, Nanocor and the transportation operations, Ameri-co Carriers, Inc. and Ameri-Co Logistics. AMCOL's common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ACO.

ITEM 3.01 NOTICE OF DELISTING OR FAILURE TO SATISFY A CONTINUED LISTING RULE OR STANDARD. The Commentary to Section 303A.03 of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Listed Company Manual requires each listed company to disclose in its proxy statement the procedure by which a presiding director is selected at executive sessions of non-management directors. On September 8, 2005, the NYSE notified counsel for AMCOL International Corporation (the "Company") that the Company failed to identify the procedure by which the director who will preside at the regularly scheduled executive sessions of non-management directors is chosen in its proxy statement dated April 11, 2005. Pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the director who will preside at any such executive session will rotate and will be the Chairman of the Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Governance, and Executive Committees in the first, second, third and fourth calendar quarter of each year respectively. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines and additional information regarding our corporate governance are posted on our website at www.amcol.com. On September 8, 2005, the NYSE advised the Company of alternative methods for curing the non-compliance, including the filing of an 8-K with the required disclosure. Although the Company does not believe that its failure to specify in its proxy statement the procedure by which a presiding director is chosen to preside at executive sessions of non-management directors is material, the Company is correcting its noncompliance by filing this Current Report on a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE: ACO) REPORTS STRONG THIRD QUARTER RESULTS WITH DILUTED EARNINGS OF $0.37 PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, ILL., Oct. 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corp. (NYSE: ACO) today reported that third quarter net income from continuing operations was $11.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share. This is compared with $12.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share in the prior year's quarter, which included a benefit of $0.14 per diluted share from income tax related adjustments. AMCOL reported net sales of $142.9 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2005, compared with $124.7 million for the same period in 2004. Operating profit grew to $16.0 million compared with $10.3 million in the prior-year period. For the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2005, net income was $32.7 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, compared with $25.3 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, in the prior-year period, including $0.14 per share from tax related adjustments. Net sales were $401.3 million compared with $348.6 million in the prior-year period. Operating profit was $37.7 million compared with $28.7 million for the 2004 period. Larry Washow, president and chief executive officer said, "We have been able to deliver another strong quarter to our shareholders in this challenging economic environment. We saw continued growth, particularly in our international business, with improvements in both of our major reporting segments."
Washow continued, "Our minerals business overall is brisk, although this segment still felt margin pressure primarily from energy-related costs driven by the current economic environment. With continued strong demand for our products, we benefited from our global position in several mineral markets." Washow commented, "We did have a record quarter from our environmental segment. Our Oilfield Services Group had a very good quarter, with fairly minimal impact from the hurricanes on the U.S. offshore filtration services group. The group's well testing and international operations were very busy." Washow also noted that the Lining Technology and Building Material Groups again posted solid numbers with strong demand around the world. AMCOL's focus on research and development was also evident this quarter as the Company introduced a nano bentonite with antiviral properties, which has been evaluated by an independent laboratory showing a reduction of viral activity for Human Influenza, Avian Influenza ("Bird Flu"), and Human Immunodeficiency Viruses. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Operating Results Third quarter net sales increased by approximately 15 percent over the 2004 third quarter. The environmental segment contributed a majority of the growth, however, the minerals and transportation segments also delivered double-digit gains. Base businesses contributed approximately 93 percent of the growth, or 13.7 percentage points, with foreign exchange and acquisitions accounting for the remainder of the improvement over the 2004 third quarter. For the third quarter and first nine months of 2005, regional sales distribution was 67 percent for the Americas; 23 percent for Europe and the Middle East; and 10 percent for Asia/Pacific. Gross margin for the quarter was 26.7 percent and approximated 2004 performance. Minerals gross margins suffered due to higher energy-related costs and product mix, while environmental delivered improved gross margins due to leverage on higher sales volumes. General, Selling and Administrative expenses declined by $0.6 million from the 2004 third quarter, which included $1.2 million of professional fees associated with amended tax returns filed in that quarter. Excluding these fees, operating expenses in the third quarter of 2005 increased by $0.6 million over the comparable 2004 period. R&D expenses were approximately $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2005 versus $1.4 million in the prior year's comparable period.
Operating profit improved by approximately 55 percent over the 2004 third quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 11 percent compared with 8 percent in the prior- year period. For the year-to-date period ending September 30, 2005, AMCOL's effective tax rate increased to 27.1 percent versus 22.4 percent as of the end of the second quarter 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to creating $1.5 million of reserves for the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets. As previously mentioned, the prior year's effective tax rate for both the year-to-date and quarter ended September 30, 2004 includes adjustments for tax benefits associated with amended returns and deferred tax adjustments at a UK subsidiary. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the Company's effective tax rate for the year-to-date period ended Sept. 30, 2004 was 30.8 percent. Minority interest and joint venture income contributed approximately $0.03 per share in the 2005 third quarter compared with $0.01 per share in the prior-year period. Our investment in India accounted for a large portion of the improvement. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding at Sept. 30, 2005 and 2004 was 30.8 million. Financial Position Long-term debt amounted to $41.0 million at Sept. 30, 2005 compared with $34.3 million at Dec. 31, 2004. Debt represented 14 percent of total capitalization at Sept. 30, 2005, compared with 13 percent at Dec. 31, 2004. Cash and cash equivalents were $15.1 million at Sept. 30, 2005, compared with $17.6 million at the end of 2004. Working capital increased to $151.8 million at Sept. 30, 2005 from $129.4 million at Dec. 31, 2004 primarily due to increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, which also had the effect of increasing the current ratio to 3.5-to-1 versus 3.1-to-1, respectively. Cash flow generated from operating activities increased to $17.5 million for the first nine months of 2005 as compared with $13.2 million for the prior-year period largely due to the working capital fluctuation mentioned previously and increased income from continuing operations. Capital expenditures amounted to $20.0 million for the first nine months of 2005, compared with $12.0 million for the prior-year period. Comparable period cash flows from investing activities for the prior year included $11.3 million more of capital expended for acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for $2.0 million of investing activities in the 2005 period compared with $13.3 million in the 2004 period.
The Company's financing activities through Sept. 30, 2005 used cash as opposed to having provided cash in the previous year's comparable period due to a decreased need to incur additional debt based on a strong generation of cash flow. Fluctuations in foreign currencies continued to negatively impact cash flows. Through the first nine months of 2005, AMCOL repurchased 104 thousand shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.95 million, or an average price of $18.70 per share. The Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase authorization of $10 million in May 2004 of which $8.05 million remains available for stock repurchases. AMCOL International Corporation, headquartered in Arlington Heights, Ill., produces and markets a wide range of specialty mineral products used for industrial, environmental and consumer-related applications. AMCOL is the parent of American Colloid Co., CETCO (Colloid Environmental Technologies Co.), Volclay International, Nanocor and the transportation operations, Ameri-co Carriers, Inc. and Nationwide Freight Service, Inc.

All capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the same meanings herein as such terms are defined in Section 5.1 hereof. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT The Borrowers have requested, and the Lenders have agreed to extend, certain credit facilities on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: SECTION 1. THE CREDIT FACILITIES. Section 1.1. Revolving Credit Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Lender, by its acceptance hereof, severally agrees to make a loan or loans (individually a "Revolving Loan" and collectively the "Revolving Loans") in U.S. Dollars, Euros and Pound Sterling to the Company, in Euros to Colin Stewart, in Pound Sterling or Euro to CETCO Europe, in Euro to the Polish Borrower, from time to time on a revolving basis in an aggregate outstanding Original Dollar Amount up to the amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment, subject to any reductions thereof pursuant to the terms hereof, before the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided that (i) the sum of the aggregate Original Dollar Amount of Revolving Loans, Swing Loans, and L/C Obligations at any time outstanding shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments in effect at such time, (ii) the sum of the aggregate Original Dollar Amount of all Loans outstanding to the Company denominated in Euros and Pound Sterling shall not exceed $25,000,000, (iii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Loans outstanding to Colin Stewart shall not exceed (euro)5,000,000, (iv) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Loans denominated in Euro outstanding to CETCO Europe shall not exceed (euro)4,000,000 and the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Loan denominated in Pound Sterling to CETCO Europe shall not exceed (pound)10,000,000, and (v) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Loans outstanding to the Polish Borrower shall not exceed (euro)9,000,000. Each Borrowing of Revolving Loans shall be made ratably by the Lenders in proportion to their respective Percentages. As provided in Section 1.5(a) hereof, the Company may elect that each Borrowing of Revolving Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars be either Base Rate Loans or Eurocurrency Loans. All Revolving Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be Eurocurrency Loans. Revolving Loans may be repaid and the principal amount thereof reborrowed before the Revolving Credit Termination Date, subject to the terms and conditions hereof.
Section 1.2. Letters of Credit. (a) General Terms. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, as part of the Revolving Credit, the L/C Issuer shall issue standby letters of credit (each a "Letter of Credit") for the account of the Company in an aggregate undrawn face amount up to the L/C Sublimit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, those certain letters of credit issued for the account of the Company by Harris N.A. and listed on Schedule 1.2 hereof (the "Existing Letters of Credit") shall each constitute a "Letter of Credit" herein for all purposes of this Agreement with the Company as the applicant therefor, to the same extent, and with the same force and effect as if the Existing Letters of Credit had been issued under this Agreement at the request of the Company. Each Letter of Credit shall be issued by the L/C Issuer, but each Lender shall be obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer for such Lender's Percentage of the amount of each drawing thereunder and, accordingly, each Letter of Credit shall constitute usage of the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender pro rata in an amount equal to its Percentage of the L/C Obligations then outstanding. (b) Applications. At any time before the Revolving Credit Termination Date, the L/C Issuer shall, at the request of the Company, issue one or more Letters of Credit in U.S. Dollars, in a form satisfactory to the L/C Issuer, with expiration dates no later than the earlier of 12 months from the date of issuance (or which are cancelable not later than 12 months from the date of issuance and each renewal) or five (5) days prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, in an aggregate face amount as set forth above, upon the receipt of an application duly executed by the Company for the relevant Letter of Credit in the form then customarily prescribed by the L/C Issuer for the Letter of Credit requested (each an "Application"). Notwithstanding anything contained in any Application to the contrary: (i) the Company shall pay fees in connection with each Letter of Credit as set forth in Section 2.1 hereof, (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 1.9 hereof, before the occurrence of an Event of Default, the L/C Issuer will not call for the funding by the Company of any amount under a Letter of Credit before being presented with a drawing thereunder, and (iii) if the L/C Issuer is not timely reimbursed for the amount of any drawing under a Letter of Credit on the date such drawing is paid, the Company's obligation to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of such drawing shall bear interest (which the Company hereby promises to pay) from and after the date such drawing is paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, and the actual number of days elapsed). If the L/C Issuer issues any Letter of Credit with an expiration date that is automatically extended unless the L/C Issuer gives notice that the expiration date will not so extend beyond its then scheduled expiration date, unless the Required Lenders instruct the L/C Issuer otherwise, the L/C Issuer will give such notice of non-renewal before the time necessary to prevent such automatic extension if before such required notice date: (i) the expiration date of such Letter of Credit if so extended would be after the Revolving Credit Termination Date, (ii) the Revolving Credit Commitments have been terminated, or (iii) a Default or an Event of Default exists and the Administrative Agent, at the request or with the consent of the Required Lenders, has given the L/C Issuer instructions not to so permit the extension of the expiration date of such Letter of Credit. The L/C Issuer agrees to issue amendments to the Letter(s) of Credit increasing the amount, or extending the expiration date, thereof at the request of the Company subject to the conditions of Section 7 hereof and the other terms of this Section 1.2. -2-
(c) The Reimbursement Obligations. Subject to Section 1.2(b) hereof, the obligation of the Company to reimburse the L/C Issuer for all drawings under a Letter of Credit (a "Reimbursement Obligation") shall be governed by the Application related to such Letter of Credit, except that reimbursement shall be made by no later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the date when each drawing is to be paid in immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent's principal office in Chicago, Illinois or such other office as the Administrative Agent may designate in writing to the Company (who shall thereafter cause to be distributed to the L/C Issuer such amount(s) in like funds). If the Company does not make any such reimbursement payment on the date due and the Participating Lenders fund their participations therein in the manner set forth in Section 1.2(d) below, then all payments thereafter received by the Administrative Agent in discharge of any of the relevant Reimbursement Obligations shall be distributed in accordance with Section 1.2(d) below. (d) The Participating Interests. Each Lender (other than the Lender acting as L/C Issuer in issuing the relevant Letter of Credit), by its acceptance hereof, severally agrees to purchase from the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer hereby agrees to sell to each such Lender (a "Participating Lender"), an undivided percentage participating interest (a "Participating Interest"), to the extent of its Percentage, in each Letter of Credit issued by, and each Reimbursement Obligation owed to, the L/C Issuer. Upon any failure by the Company to pay any Reimbursement Obligation at the time required on the date the related drawing is to be paid, as set forth in Section 1.2(c) above, or if the L/C Issuer is required at any time to return to the Company or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other Person any portion of any payment of any Reimbursement Obligation, each Participating Lender shall, not later than the Business Day it receives a certificate in the form of Exhibit A hereto from the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to such effect, if such certificate is received before 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time), or not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) the following Business Day, if such certificate is received after such time, pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer an amount equal to such Participating Lender's Percentage of such unpaid or recaptured Reimbursement Obligation together with interest on such amount accrued from the date the related payment was made by the L/C Issuer to the date of such payment by such Participating Lender at a rate per annum equal to: (i) from the date the related payment was made by the L/C Issuer to the date two (2) Business Days after payment by such Participating Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from the date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Participating Lender to the date such payment is made by such Participating Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. Each such Participating Lender shall thereafter be entitled to receive its Percentage of each payment received in respect of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation and of interest paid thereon, with the L/C Issuer retaining its Percentage thereof as a Lender hereunder. The several obligations of the Participating Lenders to the L/C Issuer under this Section 1.3 shall be absolute, irrevocable, and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever and shall not be subject to any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which any Participating Lender may have or have had against any Borrower, the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person whatsoever. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by any Default or Event of Default or by any reduction or termination of any Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender, and each payment by a Participating Lender under this Section 1.2 shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. -3-
(e) Indemnification. The Participating Lenders shall, to the extent of their respective Percentages, indemnify the L/C Issuer (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result from the L/C Issuer's gross negligence or willful misconduct) that the L/C Issuer may suffer or incur in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it. The obligations of the Participating Lenders under this Section 1.2(e) and all other parts of this Section 1.2 shall survive termination of this Agreement and of all Applications, Letters of Credit, and all drafts and other documents presented in connection with drawings thereunder. (f) Manner of Requesting a Letter of Credit. The Company shall provide at least five (5) Business Days' advance written notice to the Administrative Agent of each request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit, such notice in each case to be accompanied by an Application for such Letter of Credit properly completed and executed by the Company and, in the case of an extension or an increase in the amount of a Letter of Credit, a written request therefor, in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, in each case, together with the fees called for by this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the L/C Issuer of the Administrative Agent's receipt of each such notice and the L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of the issuance of the Letter of Credit so requested. Section 1.3. Applicable Interest Rates. (a) Base Rate Loans. Each Base Rate Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest during each Interest Period it is outstanding (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date such Loan is advanced or continued, or created by conversion from a Eurocurrency Loan, until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect, payable on the last day of its Interest Period and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). "Base Rate" means for any day the greater of: (i) the rate of interest announced or otherwise established by the Administrative Agent from time to time as its prime commercial rate as in effect on such day, with any change in the Base Rate resulting from a change in said prime commercial rate to be effective as of the date of the relevant change in said prime commercial rate (it being acknowledged and agreed that such rate may not be the Administrative Agent's best or lowest rate) and (ii) the sum of (x) the rate determined by the Administrative Agent to be the average (rounded upward, if necessary, to the next higher 1/100 of 1%) of the rates per annum quoted to the Administrative Agent at approximately 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) (or as soon thereafter as is practicable) on such day (or, if such day is not a Business Day, on the immediately preceding Business Day) by two or more Federal funds brokers selected by the Administrative Agent for sale to the Administrative Agent at face value of Federal funds in the secondary market in an amount equal or comparable to the principal amount owed to the Administrative Agent for which such rate is being determined, plus (y) 1/2 of 1%. -4-
(b) Eurocurrency Loans. Each Eurocurrency Loan made or maintained by a Lender shall bear interest during each Interest Period it is outstanding (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from the date such Loan is advanced or continued, or created by conversion from a Base Rate Loan, until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Adjusted LIBOR applicable for such Interest Period, payable on the last day of the Interest Period and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), and, if the applicable Interest Period is longer than three months, on each day occurring every three months after the commencement of such Interest Period. "Adjusted LIBOR" means, for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans, a rate per annum determined in accordance with the following formula: LIBOR Adjusted LIBOR = ----------------------------------- 1 - Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage "Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage" means, for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans, the daily average for the applicable Interest Period of the maximum rate, expressed as a decimal, at which reserves (including, without limitation, any supplemental, marginal, and emergency reserves) are imposed during such Interest Period by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (or any successor) on "eurocurrency liabilities", as defined in such Board's Regulation D (or in respect of any other category of liabilities that includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets that include loans by non-United States offices of any Lender to United States residents), subject to any amendments of such reserve requirement by such Board or its successor, taking into account any transitional adjustments thereto. For purposes of this definition, the Eurocurrency Loans shall be deemed to be "eurocurrency liabilities" as defined in Regulation D without benefit or credit for any prorations, exemptions or offsets under Regulation D. "LIBOR" means, for an Interest Period for a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans, (a) the LIBOR Index Rate for such Interest Period, if such rate is available, and (b) if the LIBOR Index Rate cannot be determined, the arithmetic average of the rates of interest per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/100 of 1%) at which deposits in U.S. Dollars or the relevant Alternative Currency, as appropriate, in immediately available funds are offered to the Administrative Agent at 11:00 a.m. (London, England time) two (2) Business Days before the beginning of such Interest Period by three (3) or more major banks in the interbank eurodollar market selected by the Administrative Agent for delivery on the first day of and for a period equal to such Interest Period and in an amount equal or comparable to the principal amount of the Eurocurrency Loan scheduled to be made by the Administrative Agent as part of such Borrowing. -5-
"LIBOR Index Rate" means, for any Interest Period, the rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next higher one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point) for deposits in U.S. Dollars for a period equal to such Interest Period, which appears on the appropriate Telerate Page for such currency as of 11:00 a.m. (London, England time) on the day two (2) Business Days before the commencement of such Interest Period. "Telerate Page" means the display designated on the Telerate Service (or such other service as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association as the information vendor for the purpose of displaying British Bankers' Association Interest Settlement Rates for the applicable currency). (c) Rate Determinations. The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Revolving Loans, Swing Loans and the Reimbursement Obligations hereunder, and its determination thereof shall be conclusive and binding except in the case of manifest error. The Original Dollar Amount of each Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be determined or redetermined, as applicable, effective as of the first day of each Interest Period applicable to such Loan. Section 1.4. Minimum Borrowing Amounts; Maximum Eurocurrency Loans. Each Borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall be in an amount not less than $500,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000. Each Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans advanced, continued or converted shall be in an amount not less than an Original Dollar Amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of 100,000 units of the relevant currency as would have the Original Dollar Amount most closely approximately $100,000 or an integral multiple thereof. Without the Administrative Agent's consent, there shall not be more than eight (8) Borrowings of Eurocurrency Loans outstanding at any one time. Section 1.5. Manner of Borrowing Loans and Designating Applicable Interest Rates. (a) Notice to the Administrative Agent. The Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall give notice to the Administrative Agent by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time): (i) at least four (4) Business Days before the date the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, (ii) at least three (3) Business Days before the date on which the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans and (iii) on the date the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. The Loans included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified in such notice of a new Borrowing. Thereafter, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or, subject to the minimum amount requirement for each outstanding Borrowing contained in Section 1.4, a portion thereof, as follows: (i) if such Borrowing is of Eurocurrency Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, may continue part or all of such Borrowing as Eurocurrency Loans or, if such Eurocurrency Loan is denominated in U.S. Dollars, convert part or all of such Borrowing into Base Rate Loans or (ii) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, on any Business Day, the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, may convert all or part of such Borrowing into Eurocurrency Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars for an Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower. -6-
The Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall give all such notices requesting the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing to the Administrative Agent by telephone or telecopy (which notice shall be irrevocable once given and, if by telephone, shall be promptly confirmed in writing), substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (Notice of Borrowing) or Exhibit C (Notice of Continuation/Conversion), as applicable, or in such other form acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Notice of the continuation of a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars for an additional Interest Period or of the conversion of part or all of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans into Eurocurrency Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars must be given by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three (3) Business Days before the date of the requested continuation or conversion. Notices of the continuation of a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency must be given no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least four (4) Business Day before the requested continuation. All such notices concerning the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), the amount of the requested Borrowing to be advanced, continued or converted, the type of Loans to comprise such new, continued or converted Borrowing and, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurocurrency Loans, the currency and Interest Period applicable thereto. The Borrowers agree that the Administrative Agent may rely on any such telephonic or telecopy notice given by any person the Administrative Agent in good faith believes is an Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent investigation, and in the event any such notice by telephone conflicts with any written confirmation such telephonic notice shall govern if the Administrative Agent has acted in reliance thereon. (b) Notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt telephonic or telecopy notice to each Lender of any notice from the Company received pursuant to Section 1.5(a) above and, if such notice requests the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Loans, the Administrative Agent shall give notice to the applicable Borrower and each Lender by like means of the interest rate applicable thereto and if such Borrowing is denominated in an Alternative Currency, of the Original Dollar Amount thereof, promptly after the Administrative Agent has made such determination. (c) Borrowers' Failure to Notify; Automatic Continuations and Conversions. Any outstanding Borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall automatically be continued for an additional Interest Period on the last day of its then current Interest Period unless the Company has notified the Administrative Agent within the period required by Section 1.5(a) that the applicable Borrower intends to convert such Borrowing, subject to Section 7.1 hereof, into a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans or such Borrowing is prepaid in accordance with Section 1.8(a). If the Company fails to give notice pursuant to Section 1.5(a) above of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding principal amount of a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars before the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 1.5(a) or, whether or not such notice has been given, one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 for the continuation or conversion of a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans would not be satisfied, and such Borrowing is not prepaid in accordance with Section 1.8(a), such Borrowing shall automatically be converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. If the Company fails to give notice pursuant to Section 1.5(a) above of the continuation of any outstanding principal amount of a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency before the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 1.5(a) and has not notified the Administrative Agent within the period required by Section 1.8(a) that it intends to prepay such Borrowing, such Borrowing shall automatically be continued as a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans in the same Alternative Currency with an Interest Period of one month, subject to Section 6.2 hereof, including the application of Section 1.3 and of the restrictions contained in the definition of Interest Period. -7-
(d) Disbursement of Loans. Not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of any requested advance of a new Borrowing, subject to Section 7 hereof, each Lender shall make available its Loan comprising part of such Borrowing in funds immediately available (or, in the case of a Borrowing denominated in an Alternative Currency, in such funds as are then customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency) at the principal office of the Administrative Agent in Chicago, Illinois. The Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of each new Borrowing available to the applicable Borrower at the Administrative Agent's principal office in Chicago, Illinois, by depositing such proceeds to the credit of the applicable Borrower's operating account maintained with the Administrative Agent or as such Borrower and the Administrative Agent may otherwise agree. (e) Administrative Agent Reliance on Lender Funding. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, by 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on) the date on which such Lender is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Revolving Loan (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such payment when due and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the applicable Borrower the proceeds of the Loan to be made by such Lender and, if any Lender has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent the amount made available to the applicable Borrower attributable to such Lender together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to the applicable Borrower and ending on (but excluding) the date such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to: (i) from the date the related advance was made by the Administrative Agent to the date two (2) Business Days after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from the date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made by such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day. If such amount is not received from such Lender by the Administrative Agent immediately upon demand, the applicable Borrower will, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of the Loan attributable to such Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan, but without such payment being considered a payment or prepayment of a Loan under Section 1.12 hereof so that such Borrower will have no liability under such Section with respect to such payment. -8-
Section 1.6. Interest Periods. As provided in Section 1.5(a) and 1.14 hereof, at the time of each request to advance, continue or create by conversion a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans or Swing Loans, the Company, on behalf of the applicable Borrower, shall select an Interest Period applicable to such Loans from among the available options. The term "Interest Period" means the period commencing on the date a Borrowing of Loans is advanced, continued or created by conversion and ending: (a) in the case of Base Rate Loans, on the last day of the calendar quarter (i.e., the last day of March, June, September or December, as applicable) in which such Borrowing is advanced, continued or created by conversion (or on the last day of the following calendar quarter if such Loan is advanced, continued or created by conversion on the last day of a calendar quarter), (b) in the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, 1, 2, 3 or 6 months thereafter, and (c) in the case of a Swing Loan, on the date 1 to 5 days thereafter as mutually agreed to by the Company and the Administrative Agent; provided, however, that: (i) any Interest Period for a Borrowing of Revolving Loans or Swing Loans consisting of Base Rate Loans that otherwise would end after the Revolving Credit Termination Date shall end on the Revolving Credit Termination Date; (ii) no Interest Period with respect to any portion of the Loans shall extend beyond the Revolving Credit Termination Date; (iii) whenever the last day of any Interest Period would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the last day of such Interest Period shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, provided that, if such extension would cause the last day of an Interest Period for a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans to occur in the following calendar month, the last day of such Interest Period shall be the immediately preceding Business Day; and (iv) for purposes of determining an Interest Period for a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans, a month means a period starting on one day in a calendar month and ending on the numerically corresponding day in the next calendar month; provided, however, that if there is no numerically corresponding day in the month in which such an Interest Period is to end or if such an Interest Period begins on the last Business Day of a calendar month, then such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day of the calendar month in which such Interest Period is to end. Section 1.7. Maturity of Loans. Each Revolving Loan and Swing Loan, both for principal and interest not sooner paid, shall mature and become due and payable by the applicable Borrower on the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Section 1.8. Prepayments. (a) Optional. Each Borrower may prepay in whole or in part (but, if in part, then: (i) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, in an amount not less than $500,000, (ii) if such Borrowing is of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars, in an amount not less than $500,000, (iii) if such is of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, an amount for which the U.S. Dollar Equivalent is not less than $500,000, and (iv) in each case, in an amount such that the minimum amount required for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 1.4 and 1.14 hereof remains outstanding) any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans at any time upon (i) if such Loan is denominated in U.S. Dollars, three (3) Business Days prior notice by the Company to the Administrative Agent, (ii) if such Loan is denominated in an Alternative Currency, four (4) Business Days prior notice by the Company to the Administrative Agent, or (iii) in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, notice delivered by the Company to the Administrative Agent no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of prepayment (or, in any case, such shorter period of time then agreed to by the Administrative Agent), such prepayment to be made by the payment of the principal amount to be prepaid and, in the case of any Eurocurrency Loans or Swing Loans, accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for prepayment plus any amounts due the Lenders under Section 1.11 hereof. -9-
(b) Mandatory. The Borrowers shall, on each date the Revolving Credit Commitments are reduced pursuant to Section 1.12 hereof, prepay the Revolving Loans, Swing Loans, and, if necessary, prefund the L/C Obligations by the amount, if any, necessary to reduce the sum of the Original Dollar Amount of Revolving Loans, Swing Loans, and L/C Obligations then outstanding to the amount to which the Revolving Credit Commitments have been so reduced. (c) Application. Unless the Company otherwise directs, prepayments of Loans under this Section 1.8(b) shall be applied first to Borrowings of Base Rate Loans until payment in full thereof with any balance applied to Borrowings of Eurocurrency Loans in the order in which their Interest Periods expire. Each prepayment of Loans under this Section 1.8(b) shall be made by the payment of the principal amount to be prepaid and, in the case of any Eurocurrency Loans or Swing Loans, accrued interest thereon to the date of prepayment together with any amounts due the Lenders under Section 1.11 hereof. Each prefunding of L/C Obligations shall be made in accordance with Section 9.4 hereof. Section 1.9. Default Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, while any Event of Default exists or after acceleration, the Borrowers shall pay interest (after as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of all Loans and Reimbursement Obligations, and letter of credit fees at a rate per annum equal to: (a) for any Base Rate Loan or any Swing Loan bearing interest based on the Base Rate, the sum of 2.0% plus the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect; (b) for any Eurocurrency Loan denominated in U.S. Dollars or any Swing Loan bearing interest at the Administrative Agent's Quoted Rate, the sum of 2.0% plus the rate of interest in effect thereon at the time of such default until the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2.0% plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect; (c) for any Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, the sum of two percent (2%) plus the rate of interest in effect thereon at the time of such default until the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin for Eurocurrency Loans plus two percent (2%) plus the rate of interest per annum as determined by the Administrative Agent (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next higher one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point) at which overnight or weekend deposits (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more than three (3) Business Days, then for such other period of time not longer than one (1) month as the Administrative Agent may elect in its absolute discretion) of the relevant Alternative Currency for delivery in immediately available and freely transferable funds would be offered by the Administrative Agent to major banks in the interbank market upon request of such major banks for the applicable period as determined above and in an amount comparable to the unpaid principal amount of any such Eurocurrency Loan (or, if the Administrative Agent is not placing deposits in such currency in the interbank market, then the Administrative Agent's cost of funds in such currency for such period); and -10-
(d) for any Reimbursement Obligation, the sum of 2.0% plus the amounts due under Section 1.2 with respect to such Reimbursement Obligation; and (e) for any Letter of Credit, the sum of 2.0% plus the letter of credit fee due under Section 2.1 with respect to such Letter of Credit; provided, however, that in the absence of acceleration, any adjustments pursuant to this Section shall be made at the election of the Administrative Agent, acting at the request or with the consent of the Required Lenders, with written notice to the Company. While any Event of Default exists or after acceleration, interest shall be paid on demand of the Administrative Agent at the request or with the consent of the Required Lenders. Section 1.10. The Notes. (a) The Revolving Loans made to a Borrower by a Lender shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of such Borrower issued to such Lender in the form of Exhibit D-1 hereto. Each such promissory note is hereinafter referred to as a "Revolving Note" and collectively such promissory notes are referred to as the "Revolving Notes." (b) The Swing Loans made to the Company by the Administrative Agent shall be evidenced by a single promissory note of the Company issued to the Administrative Agent in the form of Exhibit D-2 hereto. Such promissory note is hereinafter referred to as the "Swing Note." (c) Each Lender shall record on its books and records or on a schedule to its appropriate Note the amount of each Loan advanced, continued or converted by it, all payments of principal and interest and the principal balance from time to time outstanding thereon, the type of such Loan, and, for any Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan, the Interest Period, currency and the interest rate applicable thereto. The record thereof, whether shown on such books and records of a Lender or on a schedule to the relevant Note, shall be prima facie evidence as to all such matters; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to record any of the foregoing or any error in any such record shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation of a Borrower to repay all Loans made to it hereunder together with accrued interest thereon. At the request of any Lender and upon such Lender tendering to a Borrower the appropriate Note to be replaced, such Borrower shall furnish a new Note to such Lender to replace any outstanding Note. Section 1.11. Funding Indemnity. If any Lender shall incur any loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any loss of profit, and any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain any Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to such Lender) as a result of: (a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest Period, (b) any failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of Section 7 or otherwise) by a Borrower to borrow or continue a Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan, or to convert a Base Rate Loan into a Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan, on the date specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 1.5(a) or 1.14 hereof, (c) any failure by a Borrower to make any payment of principal on any Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), or -11-
(d) any acceleration of the maturity of a Eurocurrency Loan or Swing Loan as a result of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder, then, upon the demand of such Lender, the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amount as will reimburse such Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If any Lender makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to the Company, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a certificate setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such certificate shall be deemed prime facie correct. Section 1.12. Revolving Credit Commitment Terminations. (a) The Company shall have the right at any time and from time to time, upon three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (or such shorter period of time agreed to by the Administrative Agent), to terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments without premium or penalty and in whole or in part, any partial termination to be (i) in an amount not less than $5,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 and (ii) allocated ratably among the Lenders in proportion to their respective Percentages, provided that the Revolving Credit Commitments may not be reduced to an amount less than the sum of the Original Dollar Amount of Revolving Loans, Swing Loans, and L/C Obligations then outstanding. Any termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments below the L/C Sublimit, Swing Line Sublimit or other sublimit applicable to a particular Borrower as provided in Section 1.1 hereof then in effect shall reduce the L/C Sublimit, Swing Line Sublimit or such other sublimit, as applicable, by a like amount. The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to each Lender of any such termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments. (b) Any termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to this Section 1.12 may not be reinstated. Section 1.13. Substitution of Lenders. In the event (a) the Company receives a claim from any Lender for compensation under Section 10.3 or 13.1 hereof, (b) the Company receives notice from any Lender of any illegality pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof, (c) any Lender is in default in any material respect with respect to its obligations under the Loan Documents, or (d) a Lender fails to consent to an amendment or waiver requested under Section 13.13 hereof at a time when the Required Lenders have approved such amendment or waiver (any such Lender referred to in clause (a), (b), (c), or (d) above being hereinafter referred to as an "Affected Lender"), the Company may, in addition to any other rights the Company may have hereunder or under applicable law, require, at its expense, any such Affected Lender to assign, at par plus accrued interest and fees, without recourse, all of its interest, rights, and obligations hereunder (including its Revolving Credit Commitment and the Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit and other amounts at any time owing to it hereunder and the other Loan Documents) to a commercial bank or other financial institution specified by the Company, provided that (i) such assignment shall not conflict with or violate any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other governmental authority, (ii) the Company shall have received the written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to such assignment, (iii) the Borrowers shall have paid to the Affected Lender all monies (together with amounts due such Affected Lender under Section 1.11 hereof as if the Loans owing to it were prepaid rather than assigned) other than such principal owing to it hereunder, and (iv) the assignment is entered into in accordance with the other requirements of Section 13.12 hereof (provided any assignment fees and reimbursable expenses due thereunder shall be paid by the Company). -12-
Section 1.14. Swing Loans. (a) Generally. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, as part of the Revolving Credit, the Administrative Agent agrees to make loans to the Company under the Swing Line (individually a "Swing Loan" and collectively the "Swing Loans") which shall not in the aggregate at any time outstanding exceed the Swing Line Sublimit. The Swing Loans may be availed of the Company from time to time and borrowings thereunder may be repaid and used again during the period ending on the Revolving Credit Termination Date; provided that each Swing Loan must be repaid on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. Each Swing Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $500,000 or such greater amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000. (b) Interest on Swing Loans. Each Swing Loan shall bear interest until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to (i) the sum of the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit as from time to time in effect (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, for the actual number of days elapsed) or (ii) the Administrative Agent's Quoted Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed). Interest on each Swing Loan shall be due and payable on the last day of its Interest Period and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise). (c) Requests for Swing Loans. The Company shall give the Administrative Agent prior notice (which may be written or oral) no later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the date upon which the Company requests that any Swing Loan be made, of the amount and date of such Swing Loan, and the Interest Period requested therefor. Within 30 minutes after receiving such notice, the Administrative Agent shall in its discretion quote an interest rate to the Company at which the Administrative Agent would be willing to make such Swing Loan available to the Company for the Interest Period so requested (the rate so quoted for a given Interest Period being herein referred to as "Administrative Agent's Quoted Rate"). The Company acknowledges and agrees that the interest rate quote is given for immediate and irrevocable acceptance. If the Company does not so immediately accept the Administrative Agent's Quoted Rate for the full amount requested by the Company for such Swing Loan, the Administrative Agent's Quoted Rate shall be deemed immediately withdrawn and such Swing Loan shall bear interest at the rate per annum determined by adding the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit to the Base Rate as from time to time in effect. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the proceeds of such Swing Loan shall be made available to the Company on the date so requested at the offices of the Administrative Agent in Chicago, Illinois, by depositing such proceeds to the credit of the Company's operating account maintained with the Administrative Agent or as the Company and the Administrative Agent may otherwise agree. Anything contained in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the obligation of the Administrative Agent to make Swing Loans shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to make more than one Swing Loan during any one day. -13-
(d) Refunding Loans. In its sole and absolute discretion, the Administrative Agent may at any time, on behalf of the Company (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to act on its behalf for such purpose) and with notice to the Company, request each Lender to make a Revolving Loan in the form of a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Percentage of the amount of the Swing Loans outstanding on the date such notice is given. Unless an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(j) or 9.1(k) exists with respect to the Company, regardless of the existence of any other Event of Default, each Lender shall make the proceeds of its requested Revolving Loan available to the Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, at the Administrative Agent's principal office in Chicago, Illinois, before 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the Business Day following the day such notice is given. The proceeds of such Borrowing of Revolving Loans shall be immediately applied to repay the outstanding Swing Loans. (e) Participations. If any Lender refuses or otherwise fails to make a Revolving Loan when requested by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 1.14(d) above (because an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(j) or 9.1(k) exists with respect to any Borrower or otherwise), such Lender will, by the time and in the manner such Revolving Loan was to have been funded to the Administrative Agent, purchase from the Administrative Agent an undivided participating interest in the outstanding Swing Loans in an amount equal to its Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Swing Loans that were to have been repaid with such Revolving Loans. Each Lender that so purchases a participation in a Swing Loan shall thereafter be entitled to receive its Percentage of each payment of principal received on the Swing Loan and of interest received thereon accruing from the date such Lender funded to the Administrative Agent its participation in such Loan. The several obligations of the Lenders under this Section shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever and shall not be subject to any set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment which any Lender may have or have had against any Borrower, any other Lender or any other Person whatever. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by any Default or Event of Default or by any reduction or termination of the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender, and each payment made by a Lender under this Section shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Section 1.15. Increase in Revolving Credit Commitments. The Company may, on any Business Day prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, with the written consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments by delivering a Commitment Amount Increase Request at least five (5) Business Days prior to the desired effective date of such increase (the "Commitment Amount Increase") identifying an additional Lender (or additional Revolving Credit Commitments for existing Lender(s)) and the amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment (or additional amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment(s)); provided, however, that (i) any increase of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments to an amount in excess of $175,000,000 will require the approval of all the Lenders, and (ii) any increase of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000. The effective date of the Commitment Amount Increase shall be agreed upon by the Company and the Administrative Agent. Upon the effectiveness thereof, the new Lender(s) (or, if applicable, existing Lender(s)) shall advance Loans in an amount sufficient such that after giving effect to its Loans each Lender shall have outstanding its pro rata share of Loans. It shall be a condition to such effectiveness that (i) no Eurocurrency Loans be outstanding on the date of such effectiveness and (ii) the Company shall not have terminated any portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to Section 1.12 hereof. The Borrowers agree to pay any reasonable expenses of the Administrative Agent relating to any Commitment Amount Increase. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment and no Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment shall be increased without its consent thereto, and each Lender may at its option, unconditionally and without cause, decline to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment. -14-
SECTION 2. FEES. Section 2.1. Fees. (a) Revolving Credit Commitment Fee. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders in accordance with their Percentages a commitment fee at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed) on the average daily Unused Revolving Credit Commitments. Such commitment fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September, and December in each year (commencing on the first such date occurring after the date hereof) and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date, unless the Revolving Credit Commitments are terminated in whole on an earlier date, in which event the commitment fee for the period to the date of such termination in whole shall be paid on the date of such termination. (b) Letter of Credit Fees. On the date of issuance or extension, or increase in the amount, of any Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof, the Company shall pay to the L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee equal to 0.125% of the face amount of (or of the increase in the face amount of) such Letter of Credit. Quarterly in arrears, on the last day of each March, June, September, and December, commencing on the first such date occurring after the date hereof, the Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders in accordance with their Percentages, a letter of credit fee at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and the actual number of days elapsed) in effect during each day of such quarter applied to the daily average face amount of Letters of Credit outstanding during such quarter. In addition, the Company shall pay to the L/C Issuer for its own account the L/C Issuer's standard issuance, drawing, negotiation, amendment, and other administrative fees for each Letter of Credit as established by the L/C Issuer from time to time. (c) Administrative Agent Fees. The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own use and benefit, the fees agreed to between the Administrative Agent and the Company in a fee letter dated September 16, 2005, or as otherwise agreed to in writing between them. -15-
SECTION 3. PLACE AND APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. Section 3.1. Place and Application of Payments. All payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and the Reimbursement Obligations, and of all other Obligations payable by the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, shall be made by the Borrowers to the Administrative Agent by no later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the due date thereof at the office of the Administrative Agent in Chicago, Illinois (or such other location as the Administrative Agent may designate to the Company) for the benefit of the Lender or Lenders entitled thereto. Any payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received by the Administrative Agent on the next Business Day. All such payments shall be made (i) in U.S. Dollars, in immediately available funds at the place of payment or (ii) in the case amounts payable hereunder in an Alternative Currency, in such Alternative Currency in such funds then customary for the settlement of international transactions in such currency, in each case without set-off or counterclaim. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest on Loans and on Reimbursement Obligations in which the Lenders have purchased Participating Interests ratably to the Lenders and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

When any Event of Default other than those described in subsection (j) or (k) of Section 9.1 hereof has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, by written notice to the Company: (a) if so directed by the Required Lenders, terminate the remaining Revolving Credit Commitments and all other obligations of the Lenders hereunder on the date stated in such notice (which may be the date thereof); (b) if so directed by the Required Lenders, declare the principal of and the accrued interest on all outstanding Notes to be forthwith due and payable and thereupon all outstanding Notes, including both principal and interest thereon, shall be and become immediately due and payable together with all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents without further demand, presentment, protest or notice of any kind; and (c) if so directed by the Required Lenders, demand that the Company immediately pay to the Administrative Agent the full amount then available for drawing under each or any Letter of Credit, and the Company agrees to immediately make such payment and acknowledges and agrees that the Lenders would not have an adequate remedy at law for failure by the Company to honor any such demand and that the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, shall have the right to require the Company to specifically perform such undertaking whether or not any drawings or other demands for payment have been made under any Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent, after giving notice to the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c) or this Section 9.2, shall also promptly send a copy of such notice to the other Lenders, but the failure to do so shall not impair or annul the effect of such notice. -50-
Section 9.3. Bankruptcy Defaults. When any Event of Default described in subsections (j) or (k) of Section 9.1 hereof has occurred and is continuing, then all outstanding Notes shall immediately become due and payable together with all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, the obligation of the Lenders to extend further credit pursuant to any of the terms hereof shall immediately terminate and the Company shall immediately pay to the Administrative Agent the full amount then available for drawing under all outstanding Letters of Credit, the Company acknowledging and agreeing that the Lenders would not have an adequate remedy at law for failure by the Company to honor any such demand and that the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent on their behalf, shall have the right to require the Company to specifically perform such undertaking whether or not any draws or other demands for payment have been made under any of the Letters of Credit. Section 9.4. Collateral for Undrawn Letters of Credit. (a) If the prepayment of the amount available for drawing under any or all outstanding Letters of Credit is required under Section 1.9(b) or under Section 9.2 or 9.3 above, the Company shall forthwith pay the amount required to be so prepaid, to be held by the Administrative Agent as provided in subsection (b) below. (b) All amounts prepaid pursuant to subsection (a) above shall be held by the Administrative Agent in one or more separate collateral accounts (each such account, and the credit balances, properties, and any investments from time to time held therein, and any substitutions for such account, any certificate of deposit or other instrument evidencing any of the foregoing and all proceeds of and earnings on any of the foregoing being collectively called the "Collateral Account") as security for, and for application by the Administrative Agent (to the extent available) to, the reimbursement of any payment under any Letter of Credit then or thereafter made by the Administrative Agent, and to the payment of the unpaid balance of any other Obligations. The Collateral Account shall be held in the name of and subject to the exclusive dominion and control of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and the L/C Issuer. If and when requested by the Company, the Administrative Agent shall invest funds held in the Collateral Account from time to time in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by, the United States of America with a remaining maturity of one year or less, provided that the Administrative Agent is irrevocably authorized to sell investments held in the Collateral Account when and as required to make payments out of the Collateral Account for application to amounts due and owing from the Company to the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders; provided, however, that if (i) the Company shall have made payment of all such obligations referred to in subsection (a) above and (ii) no Letters of Credit, Revolving Credit Commitments, Loans or other Obligations remain outstanding hereunder, then the Administrative Agent shall release to the Company any remaining amounts held in the Collateral Account. -51-
Section 9.5. Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall give notice to the Company under Section 9.1(c) hereof promptly upon being requested to do so by any Lender and shall thereupon notify all the Lenders thereof. Section 9.6. Expenses. The Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and any other holder of any Note outstanding hereunder, all costs and expenses reasonably incurred or paid by the Administrative Agent and such Lender or any such holder, including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, in connection with any Default or Event of Default hereunder or in connection with the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding under the United States Bankruptcy Code involving any Borrower or any Subsidiary as a debtor thereunder). SECTION 10. CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES. Section 10.1. Change of Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any Note, if at any time any change in applicable law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or continue to maintain any Eurocurrency Loans or to perform its obligations as contemplated hereby, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Company and such Lender's obligations to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans under this Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans. The Borrowers shall prepay on demand the outstanding principal amount of any such affected Eurocurrency Loans, together with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to such Lender under this Agreement; provided, however, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such Borrower may then elect to borrow the principal amount of the affected Eurocurrency Loans from such Lender by means of Base Rate Loans from such Lender, which Base Rate Loans shall not be made ratably by the Lenders but only from such affected Lender. Section 10.2. Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain, or Inadequacy of, LIBOR. If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans: (a) the Administrative Agent determines that deposits in the applicable currency (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to it in the interbank eurodollar market for such Interest Period, or that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR, or (b) the Required Lenders advise the Administrative Agent that (i) LIBOR as determined by the Administrative Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding their Eurocurrency Loans for such Interest Period or (ii) that the making or funding of Eurocurrency Loans become impracticable, then the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Lenders to make Eurocurrency Loans shall be suspended. -52-
Section 10.3. Increased Cost and Reduced Return. (a) If, on or after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency: (i) shall subject any Lender (or its Lending Office) to any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Eurocurrency Loans, its Notes, its Letter(s) of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligations owed to it or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, issue a Letter of Credit, or to participate therein, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender (or its Lending Office) of the principal of or interest on its Eurocurrency Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, or participations therein or any other amounts due under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in respect of its Eurocurrency Loans, Letter(s) of Credit, any participation therein, any Reimbursement Obligations owed to it, or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, or issue a Letter of Credit, or acquire participations therein (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender or its Lending Office imposed by the jurisdiction in which such Lender's principal executive office or Lending Office is located); or (ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement (including, without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Eurocurrency Loans any such requirement included in an applicable Eurocurrency Reserve Percentage) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (or its Lending Office) or shall impose on any Lender (or its Lending Office) or on the interbank market any other condition affecting its Eurocurrency Loans, its Notes, its Letter(s) of Credit, or its participation in any thereof, any Reimbursement Obligation owed to it, or its obligation to make Eurocurrency Loans, or to issue a Letter of Credit, or to participate therein; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender (or its Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan, issuing or maintaining a Letter of Credit, or participating therein, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its Lending Office) under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall be obligated to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. (b) If, after the date hereof, any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall have determined that the adoption of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Lending Office) or any corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has had the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction. -53-
(c) A certificate of a Lender claiming compensation under this Section 10.3 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive if reasonably determined. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods. Section 10.4. Lending Offices. Each Lender may, at its option, elect to make its Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified on the appropriate signature page hereof (each a "Lending Office") for each type of Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent. Section 10.5. Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder with respect to Eurocurrency Loans shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurocurrency Loan through the purchase of deposits in the interbank eurodollar market having a maturity corresponding to such Loan's Interest Period, and bearing an interest rate equal to LIBOR for such Interest Period. SECTION 11. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Section 11.1. Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent. Each Lender hereby appoints Harris N.A. as the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents and hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as Administrative Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Lenders expressly agree that the Administrative Agent is not acting as a fiduciary of the Lenders in respect of the Loan Documents, the Borrowers or otherwise, and nothing herein or in any of the other Loan Documents shall result in any duties or obligations on the Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders except as expressly set forth herein. Section 11.2. Administrative Agent and its Affiliates. The Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any other Lender and may exercise or refrain from exercising such rights and power as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrowers or any Affiliate of any Borrower as if it were not the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. The term "Lender" as used herein and in all other Loan Documents, unless the context otherwise clearly requires, includes the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. References in Section 1 hereof to the Administrative Agent's Loans, or to the amount owing to the Administrative Agent for which an interest rate is being determined, refer to the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender. -54-
Section 11.3. Action by Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent receives from the Company a written notice of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.5 hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give each of the Lenders written notice thereof. The obligations of the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents are only those expressly set forth therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action hereunder with respect to any Default or Event of Default, except as expressly provided in Sections 9.2 and 9.5. Unless and until the Required Lenders give such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take or refrain from taking such actions as it deems appropriate and in the best interest of all the Lenders. In no event, however, shall the Administrative Agent be required to take any action in violation of applicable law or of any provision of any Loan Document, and the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder or under any other Loan Document unless it first receives any further assurances of its indemnification from the Lenders that it may require, including prepayment of any related expenses and any other protection it requires against any and all costs, expense, and liability which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default exists unless notified in writing to the contrary by a Lender or the Company. In all cases in which the Loan Documents do not require the Administrative Agent to take specific action, the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in using its discretion in failing to take or in taking any action thereunder. Any instructions of the Required Lenders, or of any other group of Lenders called for under the specific provisions of the Loan Documents, shall be binding upon all the Lenders and the holders of the Obligations. Section 11.4. Consultation with Experts. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants, and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts. Section 11.5. Liability of Administrative Agent; Credit Decision. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection with the Loan Documents: (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into or verify: (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in connection with this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Credit Event; (ii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or agreements of any Borrower or any Subsidiary contained herein or in any other Loan Document; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Section 7 hereof, except receipt of items required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent; or -55-
(iv) the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, perfection, value, worth or collectibility hereof or of any other Loan Document or of any other documents or writing furnished in connection with any Loan Document; and the Administrative Agent makes no representation of any kind or character with respect to any such matter mentioned in this sentence. The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under any of the Loan Documents by or through employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the Lenders, the Borrowers, or any other Person for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected with reasonable care. The Administrative Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice, consent, certificate, other document or statement (whether written or oral) believed by it to be genuine or to be sent by the proper party or parties. In particular and without limiting any of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall have no responsibility for confirming the accuracy of any compliance certificate or other document or instrument received by it under the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent may treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until written notice of transfer shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent signed by such payee in form satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that it has independently and without reliance on the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such information, investigations and inquiries as it deems appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to extend credit to the Borrowers in the manner set forth in the Loan Documents. It shall be the responsibility of each Lender to keep itself informed as to the creditworthiness of each Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and the Administrative Agent shall have no liability to any Lender with respect thereto. Section 11.6. Indemnity. The Lenders shall ratably, in accordance with their respective Percentages, indemnify and hold the Administrative Agent, and its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by it under any Loan Document or in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby, regardless of when asserted or arising, except to the extent they are promptly reimbursed for the same by the Borrowers and except to the extent that any event giving rise to a claim was caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking to be indemnified. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to offset amounts received for the account of a Lender under this Agreement against unpaid amounts due from such Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder (whether as fundings of participations, indemnities or otherwise), but shall not be entitled to offset against amounts owed to the Administrative Agent by any Lender arising outside of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Section 11.7. Resignation and Removal of Administrative Agent and Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Company. The Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by written notice received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, -56-
within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the removed Administrative Agent's receipt of notice from the Required Lenders then the retiring or removed Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which may be any Lender hereunder or any commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $200,000,000. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations thereunder. After any retiring or removed Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 11 and all protective provisions of the other Loan Documents shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent, but no successor Administrative Agent shall in any event be liable or responsible for any actions of its predecessor. If the Administrative Agent resigns or is removed and no successor is appointed, the rights and obligations of such Administrative Agent shall be automatically assumed by the Required Lenders and the Borrowers shall be directed to make all payments due each Lender hereunder directly to such Lender. Section 11.8. L/C Issuer. The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith. The L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in this Section 11 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the Applications pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Administrative Agent", as used in this Section 11, included the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions and (ii) as additionally provided in this Agreement with respect to such L/C Issuer. Section 11.9. Hedging Liability and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability Arrangements. By virtue of a Lender's execution of this Agreement or an assignment agreement pursuant to Section 13.12 hereof, as the case may be, any Affiliate of such Lender with whom any Borrower or any Subsidiary has entered into an agreement creating Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability shall be deemed a Lender party hereto for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom the Administrative Agent is acting, it being understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of such Affiliate under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Affiliate's right to share in payments and collections out of the Guaranties as more fully set forth in Section 3.1 hereof. In connection with any such distribution of payments and collections, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Lender or its Affiliate with respect to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability unless such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent in writing of the amount of any such liability owed to it or its Affiliate prior to such distribution. Section 11.10. Designation of Additional Agents. The Administrative Agent shall have the continuing right, for purposes hereof, at any time and from time to time to designate one or more of the Lenders (and/or its or their Affiliates) as "syndication agents," "documentation agents," "arrangers," or other designations for purposes hereto, but such designation shall have no substantive effect, and such Lenders and their Affiliates shall have no additional powers, duties or responsibilities as a result thereof. -57-
SECTION 12. THE GUARANTEES. Section 12.1. The Guarantees. To induce the Lenders to provide the credits described herein and in consideration of benefits expected to accrue to the Borrowers by reason of the Revolving Credit Commitments and for other good and valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and each Subsidiary party hereto (including any Subsidiary formed or acquired after the Closing Date executing an Additional Guarantor Supplement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G or such other form acceptable to the Administrative Agent) hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee jointly and severally to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, and their Affiliates, the due and punctual payment of all present and future Obligations, Hedging Liability, and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability, including, but not limited to, the due and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Notes, the Reimbursement Obligations, and the due and punctual payment of all other Obligations now or hereafter owed by any Borrower under the Loan Documents and the due and punctual payment of all Hedging Liability and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability, in each case as and when the same shall become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, according to the terms hereof and thereof (including interest which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, would otherwise accrue on any such indebtedness, obligation, or liability). In case of failure by any Borrower or other obligor punctually to pay any Obligations, Hedging Liability, or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability guaranteed hereby, each Guarantor hereby unconditionally agrees to make such payment or to cause such payment to be made punctually as and when the same shall become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, and as if such payment were made by such Borrower or such obligor. Section 12.2. Guarantee Unconditional. The obligations of each Guarantor under this Section 12 shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged, or otherwise affected by: (a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver, or release in respect of any obligation of any Borrower or other obligor or of any other guarantor under this Agreement or any other Loan Document or by operation of law or otherwise; (b) any modification or amendment of or supplement to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement relating to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability; (c) any change in the corporate existence, structure, or ownership of, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, or other similar proceeding affecting, any Borrower or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any of their respective assets, or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Borrower or other obligor or of any other guarantor contained in any Loan Document; (d) the existence of any claim, set-off, or other rights which any Borrower or other obligor or any other guarantor may have at any time against the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Person, whether or not arising in connection herewith; -58-
(e) any failure to assert, or any assertion of, any claim or demand or any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights or remedies against any Borrower or other obligor, any other guarantor, or any other Person or Property; (f) any application of any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any obligation of any Borrower or other obligor, regardless of what obligations of any Borrower or other obligor remain unpaid; (g) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any Borrower or other obligor or any other guarantor for any reason of this Agreement or of any other Loan Document or any agreement relating to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability or any provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any Borrower or other obligor or any other guarantor of the principal of or interest on any Note or any Reimbursement Obligation or any other amount payable under the Loan Documents or any agreement relating to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability; or (h) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Person or any other circumstance whatsoever that might, but for the provisions of this paragraph, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 12. Section 12.3. Discharge Only upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances. Each Guarantor's obligations under this Section 12 shall remain in full force and effect until the Revolving Credit Commitments are terminated, all Letters of Credit have expired, and the principal of and interest on the Notes and all other amounts payable by the Borrowers and the Guarantors under this Agreement and all other Loan Documents and, if then outstanding and unpaid, all Hedging Liability and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability shall have been paid in full. If at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Note or any Reimbursement Obligation or any other amount payable by any Borrower or other obligor or any Guarantor under the Loan Documents or any agreement relating to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, or reorganization of any Borrower or other obligor or of any guarantor, or otherwise, each Guarantor's obligations under this Section 12 with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such payment had become due but had not been made at such time. Section 12.4. Subrogation. Each Guarantor agrees it will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation by any payment made hereunder, or otherwise, until all the Obligations, Hedging Liability, and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability shall have been paid in full subsequent to the termination of all the Revolving Credit Commitments and expiration of all Letters of Credit. If any amount shall be paid to a Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time prior to the later of (x) the payment in full of the Obligations, Hedging Liability, and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability and all other amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder and the other Loan Documents and (y) the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments and expiration of all Letters of Credit, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (and their Affiliates) and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders (and their Affiliates) or be credited and applied upon the Obligations, Hedging Liability, and Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. -59-
Section 12.5. Waivers. Each Guarantor irrevocably waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest, and any notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any other Person against any Borrower or other obligor, another guarantor, or any other Person. Section 12.6. Limit on Recovery. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the right of recovery against each Guarantor under this Section 12 shall not exceed the lowest amount which would render such Guarantor's obligations under this Section 12 void or voidable under applicable law, including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance law minus $1.00. Section 12.7. Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by any Borrower or other obligor under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or under any agreement relating to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability, is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower or such obligor, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or under any agreement relating to Hedging Liability or Funds Transfer and Deposit Account Liability, shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent made at the request of the Required Lenders. Section 12.8. Benefit to Guarantors. The Borrowers and the Guarantors are engaged in related businesses and integrated to such an extent that the financial strength and flexibility of the Borrowers has a direct impact on the success of each Guarantor. Each Guarantor will derive substantial direct and indirect benefit from the extensions of credit hereunder. Section 12.9. Guarantor Covenants. Each Guarantor shall take such action as the Borrowers are required by this Agreement to cause such Guarantor to take, and shall refrain from taking such action as the Borrowers are required by this Agreement to prohibit such Guarantor from taking. SECTION 13. MISCELLANEOUS. Section 13.1. Withholding Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Withholding. Except as otherwise required by law and subject to Section 13.1(b) hereof, each payment by the Borrowers and the Guarantors under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be made without withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes (other than overall net income taxes on the recipient) imposed by or within the jurisdiction in which such Borrower or such Guarantor is domiciled, any jurisdiction from which such Borrower or such Guarantor makes any payment, or (in each case) any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein. If any such withholding is so required, such Borrower or such Guarantor shall make the withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate governmental authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon, and forthwith pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Lender and the Administrative Agent free and clear of such taxes (including such taxes on such additional amount) is equal to the amount which that Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) would have received had such withholding not been made. -60-
If the Administrative Agent or any Lender pays any amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or interest, such Borrower or such Guarantor shall reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Lender for that payment on demand in the currency in which such payment was made. If such Borrower or such Guarantor pays any such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof to the Lender or Administrative Agent on whose account such withholding was made (with a copy to the Administrative Agent if not the recipient of the original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment. (b) U.S. Withholding Tax Exemptions. Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or before the date the initial Credit Event is made hereunder or, if later, the date such financial institution becomes a Lender hereunder, two duly completed and signed copies of (i) either Form W-8 BEN (relating to such Lender and entitling it to a complete exemption from withholding under the Code on all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) or Form W-8 ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Obligations) of the United States Internal Revenue Service or (ii) solely if such Lender is claiming exemption from United States withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest", a Form W-8 BEN, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and a certificate representing that such Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Company and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Company (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code). Thereafter and from time to time, each Lender shall submit to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent such additional duly completed and signed copies of one or the other of such Forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United States taxing authorities) and such other certificates as may be (i) requested by the Company in a written notice, directly or through the Administrative Agent, to such Lender and (ii) required under then-current United States law or regulations to avoid or reduce United States withholding taxes on payments in respect of all amounts to be received by such Lender, including fees, pursuant to the Loan Documents or the Obligations. Upon the request of the Company or the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall submit to the Company and the Administrative Agent a certificate to the effect that it is such a United States person. (c) Inability of Lender to Submit Forms. If any Lender determines, as a result of any change in applicable law, regulation or treaty, or in any official application or interpretation thereof, that it is unable to submit to the Company or the Administrative Agent any form or certificate that such Lender is obligated to submit pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 13.1 or that such Lender is required to withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate previously submitted or any such form or certificate otherwise becomes ineffective or inaccurate, such Lender shall promptly notify the Company and Administrative Agent of such fact and the Lender shall to that extent not be obligated to provide any such form or certificate and will be entitled to withdraw or cancel any affected form or certificate, as applicable. -61-
Section 13.2. No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies. No delay or failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on the part of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations in the exercise of any power or right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. The rights and remedies hereunder of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies which any of them would otherwise have. Section 13.3. Non-Business Days. If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date of such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day on which date such payment shall be due and payable. In the case of any payment of principal falling due on a day which is not a Business Day, interest on such principal amount shall continue to accrue during such extension at the rate per annum then in effect, which accrued amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of interest. Section 13.4. Documentary Taxes. The Borrowers agree to pay on demand any documentary, stamp or similar taxes payable in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including interest and penalties, in the event any such taxes are assessed, irrespective of when such assessment is made and whether or not any credit is then in use or available hereunder. Section 13.5. Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties made herein or in any other Loan Document or in certificates given pursuant hereto or thereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the date as of which they were made as long as any credit is in use or available hereunder. Section 13.6. Survival of Indemnities. All indemnities and other provisions relative to reimbursement to the Lenders of amounts sufficient to protect the yield of the Lenders with respect to the Loans and Letters of Credit, including, but not limited to, Sections 1.11, 10.3, and 13.15 hereof, shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the payment of the Obligations. Section 13.7. Sharing of Set-Off. Each Lender agrees with each other Lender a party hereto that if such Lender shall receive and retain any payment, whether by set-off or application of deposit balances or otherwise, on any of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations in excess of its ratable share of payments on all such Obligations then outstanding to the Lenders, then such Lender shall purchase for cash at face value, but without recourse, ratably from each of the other Lenders such amount of the Loans or Reimbursement Obligations, or participations therein, held by each such other Lenders (or interest therein) as shall be necessary to cause such Lender to share such excess payment ratably with all the other Lenders; provided, however, that if any such purchase is made by any Lender, and if such excess payment or part thereof is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, the related purchases from the other Lenders shall be rescinded ratably and the purchase price restored as to the portion of such excess payment so recovered, but without interest. For purposes of this Section, amounts owed to or recovered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Reimbursement Obligations in which Lenders have been required to fund their participation shall be treated as amounts owed to or recovered by the L/C Issuer as a Lender hereunder. -62-
Section 13.8. Notices. Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be in writing (including, without limitation, notice by telecopy) and shall be given to the relevant party at its address or telecopier number set forth below, or such other address or telecopier number as such party may hereafter specify by notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers given by courier, by United States certified or registered mail, by telecopy or by other telecommunication device capable of creating a written record of such notice and its receipt.

Section 13.9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, and by the different parties hereto on separate counterpart signature pages, and all such counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Section 13.10. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Borrowers and the Guarantors and their successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders and the benefit of their respective successors and assigns, including any subsequent holder of any of the Obligations. The Borrowers and the Guarantors may not assign any of their rights or obligations under any Loan Document without the written consent of all of the Lenders. -63-
Section 13.11. Participants. Each Lender shall have the right at its own cost to grant participations (to be evidenced by one or more agreements or certificates of participation) in the Loans made and Reimbursement Obligations and/or Revolving Credit Commitment held by such Lender at any time and from time to time to one or more other Persons; provided that no such participation shall relieve any Lender of any of its obligations under this Agreement, and, provided, further that no such participant shall have any rights under this Agreement except as provided in this Section, and the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation or responsibility to such participant. Any agreement pursuant to which such participation is granted shall provide that the granting Lender shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, except that such agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree to any modification, amendment or waiver of the Loan Documents that would reduce the amount of or postpone any fixed date for payment of any Obligation in which such participant has an interest. Any party to which such a participation has been granted shall have the benefits of Section 1.12 and Section 10.3 hereof. The Borrowers authorize each Lender to disclose to any participant or prospective participant under this Section any financial or other information pertaining to any Borrower or any Subsidiary. Section 13.12. Assignments. (a) Each Lender shall have the right at any time, with the prior consent of the Administrative Agent (and the L/C Issuers, if other than the Administrative Agent) and, so long as no Event of Default then exists, the Company (which consent of the Company shall not be unreasonably withheld) to sell, assign, transfer or negotiate all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes then held by such assigning Lender, together with an equivalent percentage of its obligation to make Loans and participate in Letters of Credit) to one or more commercial banks or other financial institutions or investors, provided that, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent, such assignment shall be of a fixed percentage (and not by its terms of varying percentage) of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents; provided, however, that in order to make any such assignment (i) unless the assigning Lender is assigning all of its Revolving Credit Commitment, outstanding Loans and interests in Letters of Credit Obligations, the assigning Lender shall retain at least $5,000,000 in unused Revolving Credit Commitment, outstanding Loans and interests in Letters of Credit, (ii) the assignee Lender shall have a Revolving Credit Commitment, outstanding Loans and interests in Letters of Credit of at least $5,000,000, (iii) each such assignment shall be evidenced by a written agreement (substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G or in such other form acceptable to the Administrative Agent) executed by such assigning Lender, such assignee Lender or Lenders, the Administrative Agent (and the L/C Issuers, if other than the Administrative Agent) and, if required as provided above, the Company, which agreement shall specify in each instance the portion of the Obligations which are to be assigned to the assignee Lender and the portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment of the assigning Lender to be assumed by the assignee Lender, and (iv) the assigning Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent a processing fee of $3,500 and any out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with any such assignment agreement. Any such assignee shall become a Lender for all purposes hereunder to the extent of the rights and obligations under the Loan Documents it assumes and the assigning Lender shall be released from its obligations, and will have released its rights, under the Loan Documents to the extent of such assignment. The address for notices to such assignee Lender shall be as specified in the assignment agreement executed by it. Promptly upon the effectiveness of any such assignment agreement, each Borrower shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender (all such Notes to constitute "Notes" for all purposes of the Loan Documents). The Borrowers authorize each Lender to disclose to any purchaser or prospective purchaser of an interest in the Loans and interest in Letters of Credit owed to it or its Revolving Credit Commitment under this Section any financial or other information pertaining to any Borrower or any Subsidiary. -64-
(b) Any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or grant to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or grant of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or grant of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or secured party for such Lender as a party hereto; provided further, however, the right of any such pledgee or grantee (other than any Federal Reserve Bank) to further transfer all or any portion of the rights pledged or granted to it, whether by means of foreclosure or otherwise, shall be at all times subject to the terms of this Agreement. Section 13.13. Amendments. Any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by (a) the Borrowers, (b) the Required Lenders, and (c) if the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuer are affected thereby, the Administrative Agent or such L/C Issuer, as applicable; provided that: (i) no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 13.13 shall (A) increase the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender without the consent of such Lender or (B) reduce the amount of or postpone the date for any scheduled payment of any principal of or interest on any Loan or of any Reimbursement Obligation or of any fee payable hereunder without the consent of the Lender to which such payment is owing or which has committed to make such Loan or Letter of Credit (or participate therein) hereunder; (ii) no amendment or waiver pursuant to this Section 13.13 shall, unless signed by each Lender, change the definitions of Revolving Credit Termination Date or Required Lenders, change the provisions of this Section 13.13, release any material guarantor (except as otherwise provided for in the Loan Documents), or affect the number of Lenders required to take any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document; and (iii) no amendment to Section 12 hereof shall be made without the consent of the Guarantor(s) affected thereby. Section 13.14. Headings. Section headings used in this Agreement are for reference only and shall not affect the construction of this Agreement. Section 13.15. Costs and Expenses; Indemnification. The Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, negotiation, syndication, and administration of the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation and execution of the Loan Documents, and any amendment, waiver or consent related thereto, whether or not the transactions contemplated herein are consummated. -65-
The Borrowers further agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, financial advisors, and consultants against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable expenses of litigation or preparation therefor, whether or not the indemnified Person is a party thereto, or any settlement arrangement arising from or relating to any such litigation) which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to any Loan Document or any of the transactions contemplated thereby or the direct or indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any Loan or Letter of Credit, other than those which arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party claiming indemnification. The Borrowers, upon demand by the Administrative Agent or a Lender at any time, shall reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Lender for any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending against any of the foregoing (including any settlement costs relating to the foregoing) except if the same is directly due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified. The obligations of the Borrowers under this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Section 13.16. Set-off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, each Lender and each subsequent holder of any Obligation is hereby authorized by each Borrower and each Guarantor at any time or from time to time, without notice to such Borrower or such Guarantor or to any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set-off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured, but not including trust accounts, and in whatever currency denominated) and any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by that Lender or that subsequent holder to or for the credit or the account of such Borrower or such Guarantor, whether or not matured, against and on account of the Obligations of such Borrower or such Guarantor to that Lender or that subsequent holder under the Loan Documents, including, but not limited to, all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not (a) that Lender or that subsequent holder shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) the principal of or the interest on the Loans or Notes and other amounts due hereunder shall have become due and payable pursuant to Section 9 and although said obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured. Section 13.17. Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents constitute the entire understanding of the parties thereto with respect to the subject matter thereof and any prior agreements, whether written or oral, with respect thereto are superseded hereby. Section 13.18. Governing Law. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents (except as otherwise specified therein), and the rights and duties of the parties hereto, shall be construed and determined in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Illinois. Section 13.19. Severability of Provisions. Any provision of any Loan Document which is unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. All rights, remedies and powers provided in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may be exercised only to the extent that the exercise thereof does not violate any applicable mandatory provisions of law, and all the provisions of this Agreement and other Loan Documents are intended to be subject to all applicable mandatory provisions of law which may be controlling and to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement or the other Loan Documents invalid or unenforceable. -66-
Section 13.20. Excess Interest. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, no such provision shall require the payment or permit the collection of any amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by applicable law to be charged for the use or detention, or the forbearance in the collection, of all or any portion of the Loans or other obligations outstanding under this Agreement or any other Loan Document ("Excess Interest"). If any Excess Interest is provided for, or is adjudicated to be provided for, herein or in any other Loan Document, then in such event (a) the provisions of this Section shall govern and control, (b) neither any Borrower nor any guarantor or endorser shall be obligated to pay any Excess Interest, (c) any Excess Interest that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have received hereunder shall, at the option of the Administrative Agent, be (i) applied as a credit against the then outstanding principal amount of Obligations hereunder and accrued and unpaid interest thereon (not to exceed the maximum amount permitted by applicable law), (ii) refunded to the applicable Borrower, or (iii) any combination of the foregoing, (d) the interest rate payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be automatically subject to reduction to the maximum lawful contract rate allowed under applicable usury laws (the "Maximum Rate"), and this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been, and shall be, reformed and modified to reflect such reduction in the relevant interest rate, and (e) neither any Borrower nor any guarantor or endorser shall have any action against the Administrative Agent or any Lender for any damages whatsoever arising out of the payment or collection of any Excess Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any of Borrowers' Obligations is calculated at the Maximum Rate rather than the applicable rate under this Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest payable on the Borrowers' Obligations shall remain at the Maximum Rate until the Lenders have received the amount of interest which such Lenders would have received during such period on the Borrowers' Obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the Maximum Rate during such period. Section 13.21. Construction. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to permit any act or omission which is prohibited by the terms of any Collateral Document, the covenants and agreements contained herein being in addition to and not in substitution for the covenants and agreements contained in the Collateral Documents. Section 13.22. Lender's Obligations Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken by the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be deemed to constitute the Lenders a partnership, association, joint venture or other entity. -67-
Section 13.23. Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. The Borrowers and the Guarantors hereby submit to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and of any Illinois State court sitting in the City of Chicago for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Borrowers and the Guarantors irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. THE BORROWERS, THE GUARANTORS, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. Each Borrower (other than the Company) and each Guarantor (other than the Company) hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and empowers the Company as its designee, appointee and agent to receive, accept and acknowledge for and on its behalf, and in respect of its property, service of any and all legal process, summons, notices and documents which may be served in any such action or proceeding. If for any reason the Company shall cease to be available to act as such, each Borrower (other than the Company) and each Guarantor (other than the Company) agrees to designate a new designee, appointee and agent in Chicago, Illinois on the terms and for the purposes of this provision satisfactory to the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Each Borrower and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any objection to such service of process and further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any action or proceeding commenced hereunder or under any other Credit Document that service of process was in any way invalid or ineffective. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the holder of any Note to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Borrower or any Guarantor in any other jurisdiction. Section 13.24. Currency. Each reference in this Agreement to U.S. Dollars or to an Alternative Currency (the "relevant currency") is of the essence. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the obligation of each Borrower and each Guarantor in respect of any amount due in the relevant currency under this Agreement shall, notwithstanding any payment in any other currency (whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise), be discharged only to the extent of the amount in the relevant currency that the Person entitled to receive such payment may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase with the sum paid in such other currency (after any premium and costs of exchange) on the Business Day immediately following the day on which such Person receives such payment. If the amount of the relevant currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Person in the relevant currency, the relevant Borrower or Guarantor agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Person against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the sum of (a) the amount originally due to the relevant Person in the specified currency plus (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Person under Section 13.16 hereof, such Person agrees to remit such excess to the applicable Borrower. Section 13.25. USA Patriot Act. Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act") hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the names and addresses of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the Act. -68-
Section 13.26. Appointment and Authorization of Company. Each Borrower irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Company to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the Company by the terms thereof, together with all such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Borrower irrevocably agrees that the Lenders and Administrative Agent may conclusively rely on the authority of the Company in exercising the powers granted to it by the terms of this Agreement. -69-

Demand in Asia/Pacific and Eastern Europe for our products remains solid and bodes well for continuing success in 2006. This quarter did present us with some immediate challenges in the minerals segment -- continued record high oil and natural gas prices, logistic problems and rising raw material costs." Washow continued, "AMCOL's 2005 performance was strong as we continued to advance towards global leadership in specialty minerals. Our portfolio of businesses and leading brands across the world showed growth in every segment. Our environmental segment improved margins over 2004, and our minerals segment continued to contribute significant revenues and income. Building on our excellent fourth quarter and year-end results AMCOL enters 2006 in position for another good year." FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Operating Results Fourth quarter net sales increased by approximately 19 percent over the 2004 fourth quarter. The environmental segment contributed a majority of the growth, however, the minerals and transportation segments also delivered double-digit gains. Base businesses contributed all of the sales growth over the prior-year quarter. Regional sales distribution for the fourth quarter was 67 percent for the Americas; 24 percent for Europe and the Middle East; and 9 percent for Asia/Pacific. Gross margin for the quarter was 25 percent compared with 24 percent in the prior-year quarter. General, selling and administrative expenses increased by $4.0 million in the 2005 fourth quarter. Corporate segment expenses were the primary cause for the growth over the prior-year quarter. R&D expenses were approximately $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 2004. Operating profit improved by approximately 33 percent over the 2004 fourth quarter. Operating margin for the quarter was 7 percent compared with 6 percent in the prior- year period. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21% compared with 17% in the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company recorded a charge for taxes of approximately $0.6 million on foreign dividends repatriated in the 2005 period. The charge was more than offset by increases in estimates for deductions such as depletion, research & development and lower effective tax rates in foreign locations. Minority interest and joint venture income contributed approximately $.03 per share in the 2005 fourth quarter compared with $.01 per share in the prior-year period.
The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004 was 30.8 million. Financial Position Long-term debt amounted to $34.8 million at December 31, 2005 compared with $34.3 million at December 31, 2004. Debt represented 12 percent of total capitalization at December 31, 2005, compared with 13 percent at December 31, 2004. Cash and cash equivalents were $16.0 million at December 31, 2005, compared with $17.6 million at the end of 2004. Working capital increased to $148.6 million at December 31, 2005 from $129.4 million at December 31, 2004 primarily due to increased inventory and accounts receivable levels, which also had the effect of increasing the current ratio to 3.4-to-1 versus 3.1-to-1. Cash flow generated from operating activities increased to $37.0 million for year-end 2005 as compared with $17.4 million for the prior-year largely due to lower working capital growth and increased income from continuing operations. Capital expenditures amounted to $27.4 million for year-ended 2005, compared with $21.6 million for the prior-year period. Acquisitions accounted for $2.0 million of investing activities in 2005 compared with $13.3 million in 2004. Through the year-ended December 31, 2005, AMCOL repurchased 105 thousand shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $2.0 million, or an average price of $18.71 per share. The Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase authorization of $10 million in May 2004 of which $8.0 million remains available for stock repurchases.

Thus, for the 2004 periods reported herein, these deductions have been reclassified to conform to the current year financial statement presentation. This change in financial statement presentation did not impact reported net income or earnings per share.

In addition, each executive is eligible to participate in all equity incentive plans, savings and retirement plans, welfare and fringe benefits, and vacation and expense policies applicable to any comparable senior executive of the Company, in accordance with their terms. If the Company terminates an executive without cause or the executive terminates his employment for good reason (as defined below) prior to a change of control of the Company (as defined below), the executive is entitled to receive: (1) a lump sum of his accrued salary and bonus; (2) a pro-rata annualized bonus; (3) his base salary for 24 months (in the case of Mr. Washow) or for 18 months (in the case of Messrs. Castagna, McKendrick and Morrison); (4) a lump sum of any amount then payable to him pursuant to the tax gross-up provision; and (5) continued employee benefits during a transition period.

(a) If, at the time of enforcement of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, a court shall hold that the duration, scope, area or activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope, area or activity restrictions reasonable and enforceable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope, area or activity restrictions.

alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection. (c) In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executive's signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to Work Product, whether because of Executive's physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright and other analogous protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 6.4 to the contrary, if Executive breaches any or all of the provisions of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, the continuation of benefits pursuant to Section 6.4(c) shall cease upon such breach and, to prevent the Executive's unjust enrichment, the Executive shall immediately pay the Company an amount equal to (i) the amount that the Executive received from the Company pursuant to this Section 6.4, multiplied by (ii) a fraction of which the numerator is the number of days remaining from the date of the breach through the first anniversary of the Executive's Termination of Employment and the denominator of which is 365. In addition to the foregoing, and to protect and compensate the Company in the event of such breach by the Executive, the Company shall be entitled to any and all remedies at law and equitable relief as described in Section 7.3.

If an Imminent Control ----------------------- Change Date (as defined below) occurs on or within 30 days after the date on which the Company delivers a Notice of Termination to Executive terminating Executive's employment not for Cause and if a Change of Control occurs within 180 days after delivery of the Notice, the Executive's Termination of Employment pursuant to the Notice shall be deemed a Termination of Employment Without Cause on or after a Change of Control and the Executive's rights and obligations shall be determined under Section 6.4 rather than Section 6.3. Any payments or benefits to be received by the Executive pursuant to Section 6.4 shall be reduced by any payments or benefits made or provided pursuant to Section 6.3. If an Imminent Control Change Date occurs on or within 30 days after the date on which the Executive has a Termination of Employment due to death or Disability and if a Change of Control occurs within 180 days after death or Disability, the Executives Termination of Employment due to death or Disability shall be deemed a Termination of Employment due to death or Disability on or after a Change of Control and the Executive's Beneficiaries' rights and obligations shall be under Section 6.4 rather than Section 6.2.

Executive agrees to undertake the following obligations, which Executive acknowledges to be reasonably designed to protect the Company's legitimate business interests without unnecessarily or unreasonably restricting Executive's post-employment opportunities: (a) Executive agrees that he will not at any time, whether during or after the cessation of his employment, reveal or permit any other person or entity to reveal, any of the Confidential Information to any person or any entity, except, and only to the extent, as may be required in the ordinary course of performing Executive's assigned duties as an Executive of the Company, and Executive agrees to keep secret, and take all necessary precautions against disclosure of, all Confidential Information and all matters entrusted to him and not to use or attempt to use any Confidential Information in any manner that may cause injury or loss, or may be calculated to cause injury or loss, whether directly or indirectly, to the Company or its customers; (b) Executive agrees that during and after his employment he shall not remove, copy, duplicate or otherwise reproduce, use or permit to be used any notes, memoranda, reports, lists, records, drawings, sketches, specifications, software programs, data, documentation or other materials of any nature relating to any matter within the scope of the business of the Company or concerning any of its dealings or affairs except as required to perform Executive's duties for the Company; (c) Upon cessation of his employment relationship with the Company, Executive shall immediately deliver to the Company all Confidential Information and other materials relating to the Company in his possession or delivered to him by the Company, including computer programs, files, notes, records, memoranda, reports, lists, drawings, sketches, specifications, data, charts, and other documents, materials and things ("Materials"), whether or not containing Confidential Information, whether or not prepared by Executive, it being agreed that all Materials shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company; 14
(d) Without limiting the obligations of Section 7.1(c), Executive agrees that while Executive is employed by the Company prior to his Date of Termination and for a period of one year following his Date of Termination he will not, whether alone or as employee, owner, partner, officer, director, consultant, agent, executive, independent contractor, or stockholder of any firm, corporation or other commercial enterprise, directly or indirectly solicit business from: (i) any customer of the Company with which Executive had contact, participated in the contact, or about which Executive had knowledge of Confidential Information by reason of Executive's employment with the Company within the one year period preceding the Date of Termination, or (ii) any current customer prospect of the Company for whom Executive directly or indirectly assisted in the preparation or submission of a proposal made by the Company to such customer prospect during the one year period preceding the Date of Termination, unless the Company acknowledges in writing its intent not to further pursue such customer prospect; provided, further, that Executive shall, however, be permitted to own securities of any public company not in excess of 5% of any class of such securities and to own stock, partnership interests or other securities of any non-public entity not in excess of 5% of any class of such securities, and such ownership shall not be considered to be in competition with the Company; and (e) Except as may be required in the ordinary course of performing his duties as an employee of the Company, while employed prior to his Date of Termination and during the one year period immediately following the Date of Termination, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or attempt to solicit any employee of the Company to work for any person, partnership or entity other than the Company, or engage in any activity that would cause any such employee to violate any agreement with the Company, or dissuade, or attempt to dissuade, any such employee from faithfully discharging such employee's contractual and fiduciary obligations to serve the Company's interests with undivided loyalty. 7.2 Non Competition. Without limiting the obligation --------------- imposed by Section 7.1, and to more fully protect the Confidential Information, Executive hereby agrees that while he is employed by the Company prior to the Date of Termination and for a period of one year following the Date of Termination, he will not, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world where the Company conducts business, render services to any Conflicting Organization in any capacity in which the Confidential Information of the Company would reasonably be considered to be useful to the Conflicting Organization; provided, however, that Executive may render services to a Conflicting organization (and which has separate and distinct divisions), as long as such services are being rendered to a part of the business that is separate and distinct from the part of the business that renders such person or entity a Conflicting Organization. (a) If, at the time of enforcement of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, a court shall hold that the duration, scope, area or activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope, area or activity restrictions reasonable and enforceable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope, area or activity restrictions. (b) "Conflicting Organization" means for the purposes of this Section, any person or entity which is engaged in or about to become engaged in, research, development, production, manufacturing, importation, marketing, licensing, selling, or servicing of a Conflicting Product. 15
(c) "Conflicting Product" means any product, process, system or service of any person or organization other than the Company or an Affiliate, in existence or under development, which is the same as or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service upon which Executive works or has worked during the three year period ending on his Date of Termination, or about which Executive acquired or acquires Confidential Information. 7.3 Remedies. Executive recognizes and agrees that a -------- breach of any or all of the provisions of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 will constitute immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which damages cannot be readily calculated and for which damages are an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, Executive acknowledges that in addition to any and all remedies at law, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the breach or threatened breach of Executive's obligations under this Agreement. 7.4 Intellectual Property. During the employment period, --------------------- Executive shall disclose immediately to the Company all ideas, inventions and business plans that he makes, conceives, discovers or develops during the course of his employment with the Company, including any inventions, modifications, discoveries, developments, improvements, computer programs, processes, products or procedures (whether or not protectable upon application by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights) ("Work Product") that: (i) relate to the business of the Company or any customer or supplier to the Company or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured, sold or otherwise provided by the Company or that may be used in relation therewith; (ii) result from tasks assigned to Executive by the Company; or (iii) result from the use of the premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the Company. Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of the Company and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a "work made for hire" within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the "Act"). If and to the extent that any such Work Product is found as a matter of law not to be a "work made for hire" within the meaning of the Act, Executive expressly assigns to the Company all right, title and or interest in and to the Work Product, and all copies thereof, and the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and all their proprietary rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due or rights of retention thereto on the part of Executive. (a) To the extent applicable, pursuant to Illinois Employee Patent Act, the Company hereby notifies Executive that the preceding paragraph does not apply to any inventions for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Executive's own time, unless: (i) the invention relates (a) to the Company's business, or (b) to the Company's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) the invention results from any work performed by the Executive for the Company. 16
(b) Executive agrees that upon disclosure of Work Product to the Company, Executive will, during his employment and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the Company execute and deliver all such documents and perform all such acts as the Company or its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection. (c) In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executive's signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to Work Product, whether because of Executive's physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright and other analogous protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.

ARTICLE IX CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY 9.1 Tax Gross-Up Payment. If at any time or from time to -------------------- time it shall be determined that any payment to Executive pursuant to this Agreement or any other payment or benefit from the Company, any Affiliate, any shareholder of the Company or any other person would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar tax payable under any United States federal, state, local, foreign or other law, then Executive shall receive and the Company shall pay or cause to be paid a Tax Gross-Up Payment with respect to all such excise taxes and other Taxes.

If an Imminent Control ----------------------- Change Date (as defined below) occurs on or within 30 days after the date on which the Company delivers a Notice of Termination to Executive terminating Executive's employment not for Cause and if a Change of Control occurs within 180 days after delivery of the Notice, the Executive's Termination of Employment pursuant to the Notice shall be deemed a Termination of Employment Without Cause on or after a Change of Control and the Executive's rights and obligations shall be determined under Section 6.4 rather than Section 6.3. Any payments or benefits to be received by the Executive pursuant to Section 6.4 shall be reduced by any payments or benefits made or provided pursuant to Section 6.3. If an Imminent Control Change Date occurs on or within 30 days after the date on which the Executive has a Termination of Employment due to death or Disability and if a Change of Control occurs within 180 days after death or Disability, the Executives Termination of Employment due to death or Disability shall be deemed a Termination of Employment due to death or Disability on or after a Change of 12

Amounts which are vested benefits or which Executive is otherwise entitled to receive under any plan, program or policy and any other payment or benefit required by law at or after the Date of Termination shall be payable in accordance with such plan, program or policy or applicable law except as expressly modified by this Agreement. 6.7 Termination Rights. Executive recognizes and agrees ------------------ that the Company has the right to terminate his employment for any reason or no reason and that upon such termination the Executive's sole right is to receive compensation and benefits in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. ARTICLE VII COVENANTS 7.1 Non-Disclosure and Non-Solicitation. Executive ----------------------------------- acknowledges that the successful marketing and development of the Company's products requires substantial time and expense. Such efforts utilize and generate valuable confidential and proprietary information, of which Executive will obtain knowledge during the course of his employment with the Company. As used herein, "Confidential Information" means any information of the Company that the Company considers to be proprietary and treats as confidential or information of any third party that the Company is under an obligation to keep confidential, including but not limited to the following: (i) trade secrets, confidential knowledge, data or other proprietary information relating to products, processes, know-how, designs, formulas, developmental or experimental work, (ii) employment status, salaries and other personnel information, decisions to offer employment, pre-employment testing and screening results, citizenship status, disability status, performance issues, executive evaluations, medical problems of executives and executives' families, garnishments and levies against wages, contents of employment agreements, statements regarding the financial condition of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliated entity, payments made to or expenses incurred by the Company or any of its executives, shareholders or directors, discounts given by the Company, vendors and other parties, minutes of Board meetings of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliated entities, contents of contracts, legal matters by or against the Company or any subsidiary or affiliated entities, business strategies, plans, proposals, names of customers and potential customers; and (iii) other information or materials of the Company 13
marked or noticed by the Company as being confidential, whether constituting a trade secret or not, and whether proprietary or not, which are of value to the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, Confidential Information includes the foregoing and other information protected under the Illinois Trade Secrets Act. Confidential Information does not include: (i) information that at the time of disclosure is in the public domain through no fault of Executive; (ii) information received from a third party outside of the Company that was disclosed without a breach of any confidentiality obligation; (iii) information approved for public release by written authorization of the Company; or (iv) information that is required by law or an order of any court, agency or proceeding to be disclosed. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall retain exclusive ownership of all right, title, and interest in the Confidential Information, including any and all worldwide copyrights, trade secrets, patent, and confidential and proprietary information rights. Executive agrees to undertake the following obligations, which Executive acknowledges to be reasonably designed to protect the Company's legitimate business interests without unnecessarily or unreasonably restricting Executive's post-employment opportunities: (a) Executive agrees that he will not at any time, whether during or after the cessation of his employment, reveal or permit any other person or entity to reveal, any of the Confidential Information to any person or any entity, except, and only to the extent, as may be required in the ordinary course of performing Executive's assigned duties as an Executive of the Company, and Executive agrees to keep secret, and take all necessary precautions against disclosure of, all Confidential Information and all matters entrusted to him and not to use or attempt to use any Confidential Information in any manner that may cause injury or loss, or may be calculated to cause injury or loss, whether directly or indirectly, to the Company or its customers; (b) Executive agrees that during and after his employment he shall not remove, copy, duplicate or otherwise reproduce, use or permit to be used any notes, memoranda, reports, lists, records, drawings, sketches, specifications, software programs, data, documentation or other materials of any nature relating to any matter within the scope of the business of the Company or concerning any of its dealings or affairs except as required to perform Executive's duties for the Company; (c) Upon cessation of his employment relationship with the Company, Executive shall immediately deliver to the Company all Confidential Information and other materials relating to the Company in his possession or delivered to him by the Company, including computer programs, files, notes, records, memoranda, reports, lists, drawings, sketches, specifications, data, charts, and other documents, materials and things ("Materials"), whether or not containing Confidential Information, whether or not prepared by Executive, it being agreed that all Materials shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company; 14
(d) Without limiting the obligations of Section 7.1(c), Executive agrees that while Executive is employed by the Company prior to his Date of Termination and for a period of one year following his Date of Termination he will not, whether alone or as employee, owner, partner, officer, director, consultant, agent, executive, independent contractor, or stockholder of any firm, corporation or other commercial enterprise, directly or indirectly solicit business from: (i) any customer of the Company with which Executive had contact, participated in the contact, or about which Executive had knowledge of Confidential Information by reason of Executive's employment with the Company within the one year period preceding the Date of Termination, or (ii) any current customer prospect of the Company for whom Executive directly or indirectly assisted in the preparation or submission of a proposal made by the Company to such customer prospect during the one year period preceding the Date of Termination, unless the Company acknowledges in writing its intent not to further pursue such customer prospect; provided, further, that Executive shall, however, be permitted to own securities of any public company not in excess of 5% of any class of such securities and to own stock, partnership interests or other securities of any non-public entity not in excess of 5% of any class of such securities, and such ownership shall not be considered to be in competition with the Company; and (e) Except as may be required in the ordinary course of performing his duties as an employee of the Company, while employed prior to his Date of Termination and during the one year period immediately following the Date of Termination, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or attempt to solicit any employee of the Company to work for any person, partnership or entity other than the Company, or engage in any activity that would cause any such employee to violate any agreement with the Company, or dissuade, or attempt to dissuade, any such employee from faithfully discharging such employee's contractual and fiduciary obligations to serve the Company's interests with undivided loyalty. 7.2 Non Competition. Without limiting the obligation --------------- imposed by Section 7.1, and to more fully protect the Confidential Information, Executive hereby agrees that while he is employed by the Company prior to the Date of Termination and for a period of one year following the Date of Termination, he will not, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world where the Company conducts business, render services to any Conflicting Organization in any capacity in which the Confidential Information of the Company would reasonably be considered to be useful to the Conflicting Organization; provided, however, that Executive may render services to a Conflicting organization (and which has separate and distinct divisions), as long as such services are being rendered to a part of the business that is separate and distinct from the part of the business that renders such person or entity a Conflicting Organization. (a) If, at the time of enforcement of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, a court shall hold that the duration, scope, area or activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope, area or activity restrictions reasonable and enforceable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope, area or activity restrictions. 15
(b) "Conflicting Organization" means for the purposes of this Section, any person or entity which is engaged in or about to become engaged in, research, development, production, manufacturing, importation, marketing, licensing, selling, or servicing of a Conflicting Product. (c) "Conflicting Product" means any product, process, system or service of any person or organization other than the Company or an Affiliate, in existence or under development, which is the same as or similar to or competes with a product, process, system or service upon which Executive works or has worked during the three year period ending on his Date of Termination, or about which Executive acquired or acquires Confidential Information. 7.3 Remedies. Executive recognizes and agrees that a -------- breach of any or all of the provisions of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 will constitute immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which damages cannot be readily calculated and for which damages are an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, Executive acknowledges that in addition to any and all remedies at law, the Company shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the breach or threatened breach of Executive's obligations under this Agreement. 7.4 Intellectual Property. During the employment period, --------------------- Executive shall disclose immediately to the Company all ideas, inventions and business plans that he makes, conceives, discovers or develops during the course of his employment with the Company, including any inventions, modifications, discoveries, developments, improvements, computer programs, processes, products or procedures (whether or not protectable upon application by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights) ("Work Product") that: (i) relate to the business of the Company or any customer or supplier to the Company or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured, sold or otherwise provided by the Company or that may be used in relation therewith; (ii) result from tasks assigned to Executive by the Company; or (iii) result from the use of the premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the Company. Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of the Company and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a "work made for hire" within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the "Act"). If and to the extent that any such Work Product is found as a matter of law not to be a "work made for hire" within the meaning of the Act, Executive expressly assigns to the Company all right, title and or interest in and to the Work Product, and all copies thereof, and the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and all their proprietary rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due or rights of retention thereto on the part of Executive. (a) To the extent applicable, pursuant to Illinois Employee Patent Act, the Company hereby notifies Executive that the preceding paragraph does not apply to any inventions for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Executive's own time, unless: (i) the invention relates (a) to the Company's business, or (b) to the Company's actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) the invention results from any work performed by the Executive for the Company. 16
(b) Executive agrees that upon disclosure of Work Product to the Company, Executive will, during his employment and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the Company execute and deliver all such documents and perform all such acts as the Company or its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection. (c) In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executive's signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to Work Product, whether because of Executive's physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright and other analogous protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive. ARTICLE VIII LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS 8.1 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement would be an "Excess Parachute Payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto in an amount that is less than or equal to $200,000, but for the application of this sentence, then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary so that no portion of any such payment or benefit as so reduced constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment; provided, however, that if any such amount or benefit would be an Excess Parachute Payment that is greater than $200,000 then no reduction in such amount or benefit shall take place pursuant to this Article VIII. 17
ARTICLE IX CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS BY THE COMPANY 9.1 Tax Gross-Up Payment. If at any time or from time to -------------------- time it shall be determined that any payment to Executive pursuant to this Agreement or any other payment or benefit from the Company, any Affiliate, any shareholder of the Company or any other person would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code or any similar tax payable under any United States federal, state, local, foreign or other law, then Executive shall receive and the Company shall pay or cause to be paid a Tax Gross-Up Payment with respect to all such excise taxes and other Taxes.

(b) If the Company fails to pay any amount provided under this Agreement when due, the Company shall pay interest on such amount at an annual rate equal to the lesser of (i) (A) the highest rate of interest charged by the Company's principal lender on its revolving credit agreements plus 200 basis points, or (B) in the absence of such a lender, 200 basis points over the prime commercial lending rate announced by The Wall Street Journal in effect from time to time during the period of such nonpayment, or (ii) the highest legally-permissible interest rate allowed to be charged under applicable law. 18

Exhibit 99.1 For further information, contact: Jennifer Melsheimer Investor Relations Manager 847.394.8730 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE:ACO) REPORTS 35 PERCENT INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER 2005 FIRST QUARTER ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, ILL., April 21, 2006--AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2006 first quarter net income of $9.7 million or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $7.0 million or $0.23 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. Net sales rose 17 percent to $142.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2006, compared with $122.1 million for the period in 2005. Operating profit grew over the 2005 first quarter by 46 percent to $12.0 million. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the financial overview. Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer said, "The first quarter is always difficult to predict so we are very pleased with the results overall. We anticipated positive year-over-year comparisons with good growth in earnings, but further benefited from a dramatically improved Oilfield Services Group performance. By continuing to focus our resources on driving improvements in diversified targeted, global markets, we expect to continue to see the benefits in our earnings." Washow noted, "While the U.S. metalcasting business is not as robust as it has been in recent quarters, we continue to focus on expansion of that market globally, adding to our year-over-year minerals' growth. As part of our Specialty Materials Group, detergents is still somewhat soft in the European market. However, we expect to gain from positive international developments in our detergent business as the year progresses. Not surprisingly our Petroleum Products sales are very strong. Our Pet Products Group is focusing on building sales momentum and improving margin structure." MORE
AMCOL Q1 2006 EARNINGS PAGE 2 OF 7 "The first quarter is usually fairly modest for our environmental segment but this year the segment delivered very strong growth in operating profits of 51 percent, benefiting from the high demand for our oil related services and a strong, early European construction market. Our continued development of products and services within the segment's markets has been an important driver providing growth in our Lining Technology, Building Materials and Oilfield Services Groups," Washow commented. Washow continued, "The majority of the general, selling and administrative spending increase is related to supporting growth in the environmental segment." FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Operating Results The Environmental segment accounted for approximately 62 percent of the sales growth in the first quarter. The Minerals and Transportation segments contributed approximately 32 and 6 percent, respectively. Gross margin for the quarter was 25.0 percent compared with 24.3 percent in the prior-year first quarter. The Minerals segment gross margin improved by 30 basis points, while the Environmental segment remained constant and the Transportation segment declined by 40 basis points. General, selling and administrative expenses were $23.7 million in the 2006 first quarter, an increase of $2.2 million or 10 percent over the 2005 period. The Environmental segment accounted for a majority of the increase over 2005, primarily due to higher personnel and product warranty expenses. Research and development expenses were approximately $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2006. Operating margin for the quarter was 8.4 percent compared with 6.7 percent in the prior-year period. Margins improved in all segments. The Company's effective tax rate was 28.9 percent for the first quarter of 2006 versus 19.1 percent for the same period in 2005. The 2006 quarter included additional expense for adjustments related to previously recorded tax liabilities. Excluding the adjustments, the tax rate would have been 27.7 percent. The 2005 tax rate was favorably impacted from changes in estimates of tax liabilities. Those adjustments added $0.03 per diluted share to earnings in the first quarter of 2005. Income from affiliates and joint ventures contributed approximately $0.04 per diluted share in the 2006 first quarter compared with $0.02 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Higher earnings from the Company's India-based investments accounted for the increase over the 2005 first quarter results. MORE

Approval of the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Annual Cash Incentive Plan and the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan
          On May 11, 2006, at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of AMCOL International Corporation ("AMCOL" or the "Company"), AMCOL's shareholders approved (i) the AMCOL International Corporation 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Long-Term Incentive Plan") and (ii) the AMCOL International Corporation Annual Cash Incentive Plan (the "Annual Cash Incentive Plan").  On February 7, 2006, the AMCOL board of directors approved the AMCOL International Corporation Annual Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan (the "Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan"), effective as of the 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  A summary of the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Annual Cash Incentive Plan and the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan is set forth below.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Annual Cash Incentive Plan and the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan are incorporated herein by reference and are attached hereto in their entirety as Exhibit 10.1, Exhibit 10.2 and Exhibit 10.3, respectively.
Summary of the Long-Term Incentive Plan
.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the granting of awards of nonqualified stock options ("NSOs"), incentive stock options ("ISOs"), restricted stock or restricted stock units, some of which may be issued as qualified performance-based awards, and stock appreciation rights ("SARs") (collectively, "Awards").
          Type of Awards
.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan will be administered by our Compensation Committee.  All determinations of the Compensation Committee are made by a majority vote of its members and are final and binding on all participants. The Compensation Committee has discretionary authority to: (i) construe and interpret the Long-Term Incentive Plan; (ii) establish, amend and rescind appropriate rules and regulations relating to the Long-Term Incentive Plan; (iii) select the individuals who will receive Awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and determine the size and terms of such Awards, retaining the right to amend or modify the Awards as permitted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan; (iv) contest rulings or decisions on matters relating to the Long-Term Incentive Plan or to any Awards; (v) make other decisions necessary or advisable for the administration of the Long-Term Incentive Plan; and (vi) determine the form in which tax withholding under the Long-Term Incentive Plan will be made.
          Administration
.  Present and future directors, officers and employees of AMCOL or any subsidiary or affiliate shall be eligible to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan.  The Compensation Committee from time to time shall select those officers, directors and employees of AMCOL and any subsidiary or affiliate of AMCOL who shall be designated as participants.
          Participants
.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan permits a total of 1,500,000 shares of AMCOL's common stock to be awarded to participants.  Shares issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan may be either authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.  If any Award shall terminate, expire, be cancelled or forfeited as to any number of shares of common stock (other than a cancellation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")), new Awards may thereafter be awarded with respect to such shares.  The maximum number of shares for which Awards may be granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan pursuant to ISOs shall be 500,000 and the maximum number of shares of common stock for which Awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units may be granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan shall be 500,000.  In addition, the total number of shares of common stock with respect to which Awards may be granted to any participant in any calendar year shall not exceed 200,000 shares and the total number of shares of common stock with respect to Qualified Performance-Based Awards (defined below) that can be paid to any Covered Employee (defined below) in any performance period shall not exceed 100,000 shares.
          Number of Shares of Common Stock Available
.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the granting of NSOs to any participant.  The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine the terms and conditions of each grant including the number of shares subject to each NSO, the option period and the option exercise price.  The NSO exercise price may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.
          Nonqualified Stock Options
          Unless the Compensation Committee otherwise determines, the option period for NSOs granted pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan will expire upon the earliest of: ten years after the date of grant; three months after termination of employment for any reason other than cause, death, total and permanent disability or retirement on or after age 65 (nonemployee directors will be treated as being terminated when they cease to serve on the Board); immediately upon termination of employment for cause; sixty months after termination of employment on account of retirement after age 65; twelve months after death or termination of employment on account of total and permanent disability; or such other date or event as specified by the Compensation Committee.
.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the granting of ISOs to any employee of AMCOL.  The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine the terms and conditions of each ISO grant, including without limitation, the number of shares subject to each ISO and the option period.  The ISO exercise price is also determined by the Compensation Committee and may not be less than the fair market value of AMCOL's common stock on the date of grant and not less than 110% of such fair market value if the participant was the holder of more than 10% of AMCOL's outstanding voting securities on the date of the grant.
          Incentive Stock Options
          Unless the Compensation Committee otherwise determines, the option period for ISOs granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan will expire upon the earliest of: ten years after the date of grant (five years in the case of a holder of more than 10% of AMCOL's outstanding voting securities); three months after termination of employment for any reason other than cause, death or total and permanent disability; immediately upon termination of employment for cause; twelve months after death or termination of employment on account of total and permanent disability; or such other date or event as specified by the Compensation Committee.
.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan permits the granting of awards of shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to any participant.  Awards of shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units may be issued to participants without payment.  Upon completion of a vesting period and the fulfillment of any required conditions, restrictions upon the shares of restricted stock or the restricted stock units expire and new certificates representing unrestricted shares of common stock are issued to the participant.  Generally, in the case of shares of restricted stock, the participant will have all of the rights of a shareholder of AMCOL including, but not limited to, the right to vote such shares and the right to receive dividends payable with respect to the shares of restricted stock.  In the case of an Award of restricted stock units, no shares of common stock or other property shall be issued at the time the Award is granted.  Upon the lapse or waiver of restrictions and the restricted period relating to restricted stock units, shares of common stock shall be issued to the holder of the restricted stock units and evidenced in such manner as the Compensation Committee may deem appropriate.
          Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units
.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the granting of SARs to any participant.  SARs granted by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan may relate to and be associated with all or any part of a specific ISO or NSO.  A SAR shall entitle the participant to surrender any then exercisable portion of the SAR and, if applicable, the related ISO or NSO.  In exchange, the participant would receive from AMCOL an amount equal to the product of the excess of the fair market value of the common stock on the date the SARs were issued, or, if the SARs are related to an ISO or an NSO, the per share exercise price under such option and the number of shares of common stock subject to such SAR, and, if applicable, the related option which is surrendered.  SARs may be exercisable during a period established by the Compensation Committee and, if related to an ISO or NSO, shall terminate on the same date as the related option.  Upon exercise, participants may be paid in shares of common stock or cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
          Stock Appreciation Rights
.  The Compensation Committee may grant awards of restricted stock or restricted stock units that are subject to the achievement of performance goals as may be determined by the Compensation Committee.  Such Awards, when they are intended to qualify under Section 162(m) of the Code, are called "Qualified Performance-Based Awards," and will be granted to persons whom the Compensation Committee anticipates to be "Covered Employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.  The term Covered Employee means AMCOL's Chief Executive Officer and each other person whose compensation is required to be disclosed in AMCOL's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission by reason of that person being among the four highest compensated executive officers of AMCOL on the last day of a taxable year.  The Compensation Committee may in its discretion grant Awards to Covered Employees that are performance based but are not intended to qualify as Qualified Performance-Based Awards.
          Performance-Based Awards
          To the extent necessary to comply with the Qualified Performance-Based Award requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, with respect to any award of restricted stock or restricted stock units that may be granted to one or more Covered Employees and intended to comply with the requirements for performance-based awards under Section 162(m), the Compensation Committee will, in writing, (a) designate one or more Covered Employees, (b) select the performance criteria applicable to the performance period, (c) establish the performance goals, and amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such performance period, and (d) specify the relationship between performance criteria and the performance goals and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Covered Employee for the performance period.  Following the completion of each performance period, the Compensation Committee will certify in writing whether the applicable performance goals have been achieved for the performance period.  No Award or portion thereof that is subject to the satisfaction of any condition will be considered to be earned or vested until the Compensation Committee certifies in writing that the conditions to which the distribution, earning or vesting of the Award is subject have been achieved.  During the performance period, the Compensation Committee may not increase the amount of a Qualified Performance-Based Awards that would otherwise be payable upon satisfaction of the conditions, but may reduce or eliminate the payments as provided for in the Award Agreement.
          The payment of performance-based awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan will be based upon the attainment of performance goals related to one or more performance criteria selected by the Compensation Committee from among the following measures, individually or in combination: (i) return on capital; (ii) earnings per share; (iii) net sales; (iv) net earnings; (v) net operating profits; (vi) expense control; (vii) working capital relating to inventory and/or accounts receivable; (viii) operating margin; (ix) share price performance; (x) implementation or completion of critical projects; and (xi) total return to shareholders.
.  The Compensation Committee may permit the exercise price for options granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan to be paid in cash or shares of common stock, including shares which the participant received upon the exercise of one or more options, provided that the shares meet any criteria established by the Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee may also permit the option exercise price to be paid by the participant's delivery of an election directing AMCOL to withhold shares from the common stock otherwise due upon exercise of the option or any method permitted by law.
          The Manner of Option Exercise
.  ISOs are not transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code.  During a participant's lifetime, his ISOs may be exercised only by him.  All other Awards are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code or in the Compensation Committee's discretion after vesting.
          Nontransferability
.  Unless the Compensation Committee establishes a different vesting schedule at the time of grant, Awards generally vest 33% after one year, 66% after two years and 100% after three years.  A participant may not exercise an option or SAR or transfer shares of restricted stock until the Award has vested.  Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, generally, if a participant's employment with AMCOL or service on the Board of Directors is terminated due to retirement (after the participant's 65th birthday or 55th birthday with the consent of the Compensation Committee), death or disability, the participant's Awards will become fully vested.  If within 12 months following a "Change of Control" (as defined in the Long-Term Incentive Plan), the employment of a participant is terminated without cause or the participant resigns for good reason, any Award issued to the participant shall be fully vested, and, in the case of an Award other than an Award of restricted stock or restricted stock units, fully exercisable for 90 days following the date on which the participant's service with AMCOL is terminated, but not beyond the date the Award would otherwise expire.  If a participant's employment with or service with AMCOL is terminated for any other reason, any Awards that are not yet vested are forfeited.
          Vesting
.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan provides that in the event of a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, share combination, or recapitalization or similar event affecting the capital structure of AMCOL, or a merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or shares, separation, spinoff, reorganization, stock rights offering, liquidation, the Compensation Committee may in its discretion make such substitutions or adjustments as it deems appropriate and equitable to the share reserve, the share limitations described above, and the purchase price and number of shares subject to outstanding Awards.
          Adjustments for Change in Capitalization
.  In the event of an extraordinary dividend or other distribution, merger, reorganization, consolidation, combination, sale of assets, split up, exchange, or spin off, or other extraordinary corporate transaction, the Compensation Committee may, in such manner and to such extent (if any) as it deems appropriate and equitable, make provision for a cash payment or for the substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding Awards for the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding Awards based upon the distribution or consideration payable to holders of common stock upon or in respect of such event.  However, in each case, that with respect to any ISO no such adjustment may be made that would cause the Long-Term Incentive Plan to violate Section 422 of the Code (or any successor provision).
          Cashouts
.  AMCOL shall have the right to withhold in cash or shares of common stock with respect to any payments made to participants, any taxes required by law to be withheld because of such payments.
          Withholding Tax
.  The following brief description of the tax consequences of Awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan is based on federal income tax laws currently in effect and does not purport to be a complete description of such federal income tax consequences.
          Federal Tax Consequences
          .  A grantee generally will have no taxable income upon either the grant or exercise of an ISO.  If the grantee does not dispose of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO within two years of the grant or one year of the exercise, any gain or loss realized in his subsequent disposition will be capital gain or loss.  If such holding period requirements are not satisfied, the grantee will generally realize ordinary income at the time of disposition in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise (or if less, the amount realized upon disposition) over the option price.  Any remaining gain is taxed as long-term or short-term capital gain.
Incentive Stock Options
          .  The grant of an NSO generally is not a taxable event for the grantee.  Upon exercise of the option, the grantee generally will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock acquired upon exercise (determined as of the date of exercise) over the exercise price of such option.  AMCOL will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the grantee in the year in which such taxable income is recognized and AMCOL is required to withhold federal income taxes with respect to any amounts included in the grantee's taxable income.
Nonqualified Stock Options
          .  The grant of a SAR generally is not a taxable event for the grantee. However, upon exercise of the SAR, the grantee generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of any cash received or the fair market value of any common stock received.
Stock Appreciation Rights
          .  A grant of restricted stock or restricted stock units generally is not a taxable event for the grantee. However, when the applicable restrictions lapse, the grantee generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of such stock on the date of lapse over the amount, if any, paid for such stock and AMCOL is permitted a commensurate compensation expense deduction for income tax purposes.  Alternatively, with respect to a grant of restricted stock, the grantee may file an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, in which case the grantee will recognize ordinary income on the date of grant equal to the excess of the fair market value of such stock on the date of grant over the amount, if any, paid for such stock.
Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units
          AMCOL is entitled to a deduction equal to the amount includable in the participant's gross income for AMCOL's tax year in which or with which ends the participant's taxable year in which the amount is included in the participant's gross income.  AMCOL's deduction is also subject to the limitations imposed by Code Section 162(m) mentioned below.  If the participant subsequently disposes of the restricted stock after it becomes substantially vested, the participant will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the participant's basis in the restricted stock, assuming the restricted stock is held as a capital asset.  Unless an election under Code Section 83(b) is made, dividends paid to a participant while the restricted stock remains subject to restrictions are treated as compensation for federal income tax purposes.  Any dividends paid on the restricted stock subsequent to a Code Section 83(b) election are treated as dividend income, rather than compensation, for federal income tax purposes.
          .  Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a public company's tax deduction for compensation in excess of $1 million paid in any taxable year to a Covered Employee. Compensation that qualifies as "performance-based compensation", however, is excluded from the $1 million deductibility cap.  AMCOL intends that some of the Awards granted to employees whom the Compensation Committee expects to be Covered Employees at the time a deduction arises in connection with the Awards qualify as "performance-based compensation" so that deductions with respect to those Awards will not be subject to the $1 million cap under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Future changes in Section 162(m) of the Code or the regulations thereunder may adversely affect the ability of AMCOL to ensure that Awards under the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan will qualify as "performance based compensation" so that deductions are not limited by Section 162(m) of the Code.
Section 162(m)
.  The Board of Directors may amend the Long-Term Incentive Plan at any time, but may not: 1) impair the rights of participants with respect to any outstanding Awards without the consent of participants; 2) increase the limitations on the shares available under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, unless such increase is approved by the shareholders; or 3) amend the provision of the Long-Term Incentive Plan that requires shareholder approval before repricing an Award.  The Long-Term Incentive Plan will terminate ten years after its adoption by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may terminate the Long-Term Incentive Plan at any time.
          Amendment; Termination
Summary of the Annual Cash Incentive Plan
.  The Annual Cash Incentive Plan will be administered by our Compensation Committee, which shall have full and exclusive discretionary power to interpret the terms and the intent of the Annual Cash Incentive Plan and any award agreement or other agreement or document ancillary to or in connection with the Annual Cash Incentive Plan, to determine eligibility for awards and to adopt such rules, regulations, forms, instruments, and guidelines for administering the Annual Cash Incentive Plan as the Compensation Committee may deem necessary or proper.  Such authority shall include, but not be limited to, selecting award recipients, establishing all award terms and conditions, including the terms and conditions set forth in award agreements, determining if such terms and conditions have been met and adopting modifications and amendments to the Annual Cash Incentive Plan or any award agreement.
          Administration
.  Awards may be granted under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan to the executive officers and other key employees of AMCOL, as selected by the Compensation Committee in its discretion.
          Eligibility
.  The Compensation Committee in its discretion may determine the performance goals to be achieved during any performance period, the length of any performance period and the amount of any award.  All awards are payable in cash and, at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, may be paid following the close of the performance period or on a deferred basis.  The Compensation Committee may establish different levels of payment under an award to correspond with different levels of achievement of performance goals specified in the award.  The Compensation Committee may reduce or eliminate an award made under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan for any reason.  The maximum aggregate award that a participant may receive in any one calendar year may not exceed $2,000,000.
          Terms of the Awards
          The payment of awards under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan will be based upon the attainment of performance goals related to one or more performance criteria selected by the Compensation Committee from among the following measures, individually or in combination: (i) return on capital; (ii) earnings per share; (iii) net sales; (iv) net earnings; (v) net operating profits; (vi) expense control; (vii) working capital relating to inventory and/or accounts receivable; (viii) operating margin; (ix) share price performance; (x) implementation or completion of critical projects; and (xi) total return to shareholders.
.  To the extent necessary to comply with the Qualified Performance-Based Award requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Compensation Committee will, in writing, (a) designate one or more Covered Employees, (b) select the performance criteria applicable to the performance period, (c) establish the performance goals, and amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such performance period, and (d) specify the relationship between performance criteria and the performance goals and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Covered Employee for the performance period. 
          Performance-Based Awards
          Following the completion of each performance period, the Compensation Committee will certify in writing whether the applicable performance goals have been achieved for the performance period.  No Award or portion thereof that is subject to the satisfaction of any condition will be considered to be earned until the Compensation Committee certifies in writing that the conditions to which the distribution of the Award is subject have been achieved.  During the performance period, the Compensation Committee may not increase the amount of a Qualified Performance-Based Awards that would otherwise be payable upon satisfaction of the conditions, but may reduce or eliminate the payments as provided for in the Award Agreement.
.  The Compensation Committee may, at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, modify, suspend, or terminate the Annual Cash Incentive Plan and any award agreement in whole or in part; provided, however, no amendment of the Annual Cash Incentive Plan shall be made without shareholder approval if shareholder approval is required under Section 162(m) of the Code.
          Amendment and Termination
.  Amounts paid pursuant to the Annual Cash Incentive Plan are intended to qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" under section 162(m) of the Code.  Therefore, AMCOL believes that under existing federal income tax laws, such amounts will be deductible by AMCOL when paid to an award recipient.  An award recipient will generally be required to recognize ordinary income upon receipt of compensation under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan.

Summary of the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan
.  The Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan will be administered by our Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee shall select the individuals who may participate in the Plan and determine the terms and conditions of each participant's award.  The Compensation Committee will also construe and  interpret the provisions of the Plan.
          Administration
.  Awards may be granted under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan to the executive officers and other key employees of AMCOL, as selected by the Compensation Committee in its discretion.
          Eligibility
.  The Compensation Committee will make awards under the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan to recognize the special effort of participants.  It is anticipated that any awards made under the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan will be in addition to awards made under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan.  All awards shall be paid in cash. 
          Awards
.  The Compensation Committee or the board of directors may amend or terminate the Annual Cash Incentive Plan at any time.
          Amendment and Termination
.  Amounts paid pursuant to the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan will not qualify as "qualified performance-based compensation" under section 162(m) of the Code.  Therefore, AMCOL's tax deductions for any awards made to Covered Employees under the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan will be subject to the $1 million cap under Section 162(m) of the Code.  An award recipient will generally be required to recognize ordinary income upon receipt of compensation under the Discretionary Cash Incentive Plan.

2006 Awards Under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan
          In February 2006, the Compensation Committee authorized certain incentive awards to executive officers under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan, subject to shareholder approval of the Annual Cash Incentive Plan.  As described above, AMCOL's shareholders approved the Annual Cash Incentive Plan at the 2006 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
          These incentive awards are intended to qualify for full deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code if they are subsequently earned and paid out.  These are cash incentive awards for the 2006 fiscal year, which will become payable for 2006 performance if certain target performance goals are achieved. 
          Target performance goals may be based upon one or more objective business criteria that apply to the individual participant, one or more business units or subsidiaries or AMCOL as a whole.  The criteria may be weighed differently for each participant.  For 2006, the business criteria for each of the executive officers is set forth in the table below.  For each of the business criteria, there is a threshold, target and maximum performance level, which has been approved by the Compensation Committee.  No amount will be payable unless a specified "threshold" performance level is reached.  All bonus amounts are subject to the following limits:  Mr. Washow, 150% of 2006 salary and Messrs. Castagna, McKendrick and Morrison, 100% of 2006 salary.

             9.         .
Terms and Conditions of Stock Appreciation Rights
             The Committee may, in its discretion, grant a SAR to any Participant under the Plan.  Each SAR shall be evidenced by an agreement between the Company and the Participant, and may relate to and be associated with all or any part of a specific ISO or NSO.  A SAR shall entitle the Participant to whom it is granted the right, so long as such SAR is exercisable and subject to such limitations as the Committee shall have imposed, to surrender any then exercisable portion of his SAR and, if applicable, the related ISO or NSO, in whole or in part, and receive from the Company in exchange, without any payment of cash (except for applicable employee withholding taxes), that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of surrender equal to the product of (i) the excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of surrender over the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date the SARs were issued, or, if the SARs are related to an ISO or an NSO, the per share Option Price under such ISO or NSO on the Award Date, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such SAR, and, if applicable, the related ISO or NSO or portion thereof which is surrendered.
             Except as otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in the Agreement, a SAR granted in conjunction with an ISO or NSO shall terminate on the same date as the related ISO or NSO and shall be exercisable only if the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock exceeds the Option Price for the related ISO or NSO, and then shall be exercisable to the extent, and only to the extent, that the related ISO or NSO is exercisable.  The Committee may at the time of granting any SAR add such additional conditions and limitations to the SAR as it shall deem advisable, including, but not limited to, limitations on the period or periods within which the SAR shall be exercisable and the maximum amount of appreciation to be recognized with regard to such SAR.  Any ISO or NSO or portion thereof which is surrendered with a SAR shall no longer be exercisable.  A SAR that is not granted in conjunction with an ISO or NSO shall terminate on such date as is specified by the Committee in the SAR agreement and shall vest in accordance with Section 11.02.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may allow the Company to settle all or part of the Company's obligation arising out of the exercise of a SAR by the payment of cash equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock which the Company would otherwise be obligated to deliver.
             10.     .
Manner of Exercise of Options
To exercise an Option in whole or in part, a Participant (or, after his death, his executor or administrator) must give written notice to the Committee, stating the number of shares with respect to which he intends to exercise the Option.  The Company will issue the shares with respect to which the Option is exercised upon payment in full of the Option Price.  The Committee may permit the Option Price to be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock held by the Participant having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined on the date of delivery, equal to the Option Price, provided such shares of Common Stock meet such criteria as the Committee shall from time to time establish (e.g. that such shares are "mature" shares under generally accepted accounting principles).
The Committee may permit a Participant to elect to pay the Option Price upon the exercise of an Option by authorizing a third party to sell shares of Common Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Option Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exercise.  The Committee may also permit the Option Price to be paid by any other method permitted by law, including by delivery to the Committee from the Participant of an election directing the Company to withhold the number of shares of Common Stock from the Common Stock otherwise due upon exercise of the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value on that date equal to the Option Price.  If a Participant pays the Option Price with shares of Common Stock which were received by the Participant upon exercise of one or more ISOs, and such Common Stock has not been held by the Participant for at least the greater of:
the use of the shares shall constitute a disqualifying disposition and the ISO underlying the shares used to pay the Option Price shall no longer satisfy all of the requirements of Code Section 422.
             11.      .
Vesting
             11.01  .  A Participant may not exercise an Option until it has vested.  The portion of an Award of Options that is vested depends upon the period that has elapsed since the Award Date.  The following schedule applies to any Award of Options under this Plan unless the Committee establishes a different vesting schedule:
Options
             Notwithstanding the above schedule, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a Participant's Awards shall become fully vested if a Participant's employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates or service on the board of directors of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate is terminated due to: (i) retirement on or after his sixty-fifth birthday; (ii) retirement on or after his fifty-fifth birthday with consent of the Company; (iii) retirement at any age on account of total and permanent disability as determined by the Company; or (iv) death.  Unless the Committee otherwise provides or the preceding sentence of this Section or Section 11.03 applies, if a Participant's employment with or service to the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate terminates for any other reason, any Awards that are not yet vested are immediately and automatically forfeited; provided, however, in such special circumstances as the Committee deems appropriate, the Committee may take such action as it deems equitable in the circumstances or in the best interests of the Company, including, without limitation, fully vesting an Award or waiving or modifying any other limitation or requirement under the Award.
             A Participant's employment shall not be considered to be terminated hereunder by reason of a transfer of his employment from the Company to a Subsidiary or Affiliate, or vice versa, or a leave of absence approved by the Participant's employer.  A Participant's employment shall be considered to be terminated hereunder if, as a result of a sale or other transaction, the Participant's employer ceases to be a Subsidiary or Affiliate (and the Participant's employer is or becomes an entity that is separate from the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates).
             11.02     .  The Committee shall establish the vesting schedule to apply to any Award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or SAR that is not associated with an ISO or NSO granted under the Plan to a Participant, and in the absence of such a vesting schedule set forth in the Agreement evidencing the Award, such Award shall vest in accordance with Section 11.01.
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and SARs
             11.03     .   Notwithstanding Sections 11.01 and 11.02 above, if within 12 months following a "Change of Control" the employment of a Participant with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates is terminated without Cause or the Participant resigns for Good Reason, any Award issued to the Participant shall be fully vested, and in the case of an Award other than an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, fully exercisable for 90 days following the date on which the Participant's service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates is terminated, but not beyond the date the Award would otherwise expire but for the Participant's termination of employment.
Effect of "Change of Control"
             12.         .
Adjustments to Reflect Changes in Capital Structure
             12.01     .  If there is any change in the corporate structure or shares of the Company, the Committee may make any appropriate adjustments, including, but not limited to, such adjustments deemed necessary to prevent accretion, or to protect against dilution, in the number and kind of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Awards may be granted under this Plan (including the maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Awards may be granted under this Plan in the aggregate and individually to any Participant during any calendar year as specified in Section 3) and, with respect to outstanding Awards, in the number and kind of shares covered thereby and in the applicable Option Price.  For the purposes of this Section 12, a change in the corporate structure or shares of the Company includes, without limitation, any change resulting from a recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, consolidation, rights offering, separation, reorganization, or liquidation (including a partial liquidation) and any transaction in which shares of Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of stock or other securities of the Company or another corporation.
Adjustments
             12.02     .  In the event of an extraordinary dividend or other distribution, merger, reorganization, consolidation, combination, sale of assets, split up, exchange, or spin off, or other extraordinary corporate transaction, the Committee may, in such manner and to such extent (if any) as it deems appropriate and equitable, make provision for a cash payment or for the substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding Awards for the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding Awards based upon the distribution or consideration payable to holders of Common Stock upon or in respect of such event; provided, however, in each case, that with respect to any ISO no such adjustment may be made that would cause the Plan to violate section 422 of the Code (or any successor provision).
Cashouts
             12.03     .  Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 12 hereof to Awards that are considered "deferred compensation" within the meaning of section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements of section 409A of the Code unless the Participant consents otherwise; (ii) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan to Awards that are not considered "deferred compensation" subject to section 409A of the Code shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either continue not to be subject to section 409A of the Code or comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code unless the Participant consents otherwise; and (iii) the Committee shall not have the authority to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan to the extent that the existence of such authority would cause an Award that is not intended to be subject to section 409A of the Code to be subject thereto.
Section 409A
             13.         .
Nontransferability of Awards
             13.01     .  ISOs are not transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code.  During a Participant's lifetime, his ISOs may be exercised only by him. 
ISOs
             13.02     .  All Awards granted pursuant to this Plan other than ISOs are transferable by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code, or in the Committee's discretion after vesting.  With the approval of the Committee, a Participant may transfer an Award (other than an ISO) for no consideration to or for the benefit of one or more Family Members of the Participant subject to such limits as the Committee may establish, and the transferee shall remain subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to the Award prior to such transfer.  The transfer of an Award pursuant to this Section 13 shall include a transfer of the right set forth in Section 18 hereof to consent to an amendment or revision of the Plan and, in the discretion of the Committee, shall also include transfer of ancillary rights associated with the Award.  The provisions of this Section 13 shall not apply to any Common Stock issued pursuant to an Award for which all restrictions have lapsed and is fully vested.
Awards Other Than ISOs
             14.         PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS
             14.01     .  The purpose of this Section 14 is to provide the Committee the ability to qualify Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units as Qualified Performance-Based Awards.  If the Committee, in its discretion, decides to grant to a Covered Employee an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that is intended to constitute a Qualified Performance-Based Award, the provisions of this Section 14 shall control over any contrary provision contained herein; provided, however, that the Committee may in its discretion grant Awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units to Covered Employees that are based on Performance Criteria or Performance Goals but that do not satisfy the requirements of this Section 14.
Purpose
             14.02     .  This Section 14 shall apply only to those Covered Employees selected by the Committee to receive Qualified Performance-Based Awards.  The designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for a Performance Period shall not in any manner entitle the Participant to receive an Award for the relevant Performance Period.  Moreover, designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for a particular Performance Period shall not require designation of such Covered Employee as a Participant in any subsequent Performance Period and designation of one Covered Employee as a Participant shall not require designation of any other Covered Employees as a Participant in such period or in any other period.
Applicability
             14.03     .  To the extent necessary to comply with the Qualified Performance-Based Award requirements of section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, with respect to any Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that may be granted to one or more Covered Employees, no later than 90 days following the commencement of any fiscal year in question or any other designated fiscal period or period of service (or such other time as may be required or permitted by section 162(m) of the Code), the Committee shall, in writing, (a) designate one or more Covered Employees, (b) select the Performance Criteria applicable to the Performance Period, (c) establish the Performance Goals, and amounts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such Performance Period, and (d) specify the relationship between Performance Criteria and the Performance Goals and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Covered Employee for such Performance Period.  Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing whether the applicable Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period.  No Award or portion thereof that is subject to the satisfaction of any condition shall be considered to be earned or vested until the Committee certifies in writing that the conditions to which the distribution, earning or vesting of such Award is subject have been achieved.  The Committee may not increase during a year the amount of a Qualified Performance-Based Award that would otherwise be payable upon satisfaction of the conditions but may reduce or eliminate the payments as provided for in the agreement evidencing the Award.
Procedures with Respect to Qualified Performance-Based Awards
             14.04     .  Unless otherwise provided in the applicable agreement evidencing the Award, a Participant must be employed by the Company or a subsidiary on the day a Qualified Performance-Based Award for such Performance Period is paid to the Participant.  Furthermore, a Participant shall be eligible to receive payment pursuant to a Qualified Performance-Based Award for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved.
Payment of Qualified Performance-Based Awards
             14.05     .  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award granted to a Covered Employee that is intended to constitute a Qualified Performance-Based Award under this Section 14 shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in section 162(m) of the Code (including any amendment to section 162(m) of the Code) or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder that are requirements for qualification as qualified performance-based compensation as described in section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, and the Plan shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.
Additional Limitations
             14.06     .  Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed in any way to limit or restrict the Committee from making any award or payment to any person under any other plan, arrangement or understanding, whether now existing or hereafter in effect.
Effect on Other Plans and Arrangements
             14.         .
Rights as Stockholder
             No Common Stock may be delivered upon the exercise of any Option until full payment has been made.  A Participant has no rights whatsoever as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Option until the date of the issuance of a stock certificate for the shares except as otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in the Agreement.
             16.       .
Withholding Taxes
             The Committee may, in its discretion and subject to such rules as it may adopt, permit or require a Participant to pay all or a portion of the federal, state and local taxes, including FICA and Medicare withholding tax, arising in connection with any Awards by (i) having the Company withhold shares of Common Stock at the minimum rate legally required, (ii) tendering back shares of Common Stock received in connection with such Award or (iii) delivering other previously acquired shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value approximately equal to the amount to be withheld.
             17.        .
No Right to Employment
             Participation in the Plan will not give any Participant a right to be retained as an employee or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any right or claim to any benefit under the Plan, unless the right or claim has specifically accrued under the Plan.
             18.        .
Amendment of the Plan
             The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or revise the terms of this Plan in whole or in part, subject to the following limitations:
provided, however, that adjustments pursuant to Section 12.01 shall not be subject to the foregoing limitations of this Section 18.
             19.        .
Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares
             An Option shall not be exercisable and a share of Common Stock shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option, and Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall not be awarded until and unless the Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such share pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or national securities association upon which the shares of Common Stock may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance.
             As a condition to the exercise of an Option, the Company may require the person exercising such Option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the shares of Common Stock are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned relevant provisions of law.
             20.        .
Substitution or Assumption of Awards by the Company
             The Company, from time to time, also may substitute or assume outstanding awards granted by another company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such other company or otherwise, by either (a) granting an Award under the Plan in substitution of such other company's award, or (b) assuming such award as if it had been granted under the Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to an Award granted under the Plan.  Such substitution or assumption shall be permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would have been eligible to be granted an Award under the Plan if the other company had applied the rules of the Plan to such grant.  In the event the Company assumes an award granted by another company, the terms and conditions of such award shall remain unchanged (except that the exercise price and the number and nature of shares issuable upon exercise of any such option will be adjusted appropriately pursuant to section 424(a) of the Code).  In the event the Company elects to grant a new Award rather than assuming an existing option, such new Award may be granted with a similarly adjusted exercise price.
             21.        .
Section 409A
             It is the intention of the Company that no Award shall be "deferred compensation" subject to section 409A of the Code, unless and to the extent that the Committee specifically determines otherwise, and the Plan and the terms and conditions of all Awards shall be interpreted accordingly.  The terms and conditions governing any Awards that the Committee determines will be subject to section 409A of the Code, including any rules for elective or mandatory deferral of the delivery of cash or Shares pursuant thereto, shall be set forth in the applicable agreement governing the Award, and shall comply in all respects with section 409A of the Code.
             22.     .
Effective Date and Termination of Plan
             22.01  .  This Plan is effective as of the date of its approval by the stockholders of the Company.
Effective Date
             22.02  .  The Plan will terminate 10 years after the date it is approved by the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may terminate the Plan at any time prior thereto with respect to any shares that are not then subject to Awards.  Termination of the Plan will not affect the rights and obligations of any Participant with respect to Awards granted before termination.
Termination of the Plan

Exhibit 10.2
1.          .  The purpose of the AMCOL International Corporation Annual Cash Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is to provide performance-based incentive cash compensation to executive officers and other selected key employees of AMCOL International Corporation (the "Company") and its subsidiaries, in order to promote the growth, performance and success of the Company.
Purpose
2.          .
Administration
             2.1          .  The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Company's board of directors (the "Committee").
The Committee
              2.2          .  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee, acting in its discretion, will have responsibility and authority to (a) select the individuals who may participate in the Plan, which individuals shall be executive officers or other key employees of the Company or its subsidiaries, (b) prescribe the terms and conditions of each participant's award and make amendments thereto, (c) determine whether and the extent to which performance goals have been met, (d) construe, interpret and apply the provisions of the Plan and of any agreement or other document evidencing an award made under the Plan, and (e) make any and all determinations and take any and all other actions as it deems necessary or desirable in order to carry out the terms of the Plan.  The Committee's interpretations of the Plan, and all actions taken and determinations made by the Committee pursuant to the powers vested in it hereunder, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned, including the Company, its shareholders and any person granted an opportunity under the Plan.
Responsibility and Authority of the Committee
3.          .
Performance-Based Compensation Opportunities
             3.1          .  Each award made under the Plan will represent the right to receive incentive cash compensation upon the achievement of specific objective target performance goals that are established by the Committee in writing and communicated to the recipient of the award by the 90 day of the applicable performance period or, if earlier, before 25% of the applicable performance period has elapsed.  The Committee will determine the performance period applicable to an award.  Subject to the requirements of the Plan and applicable law, each award will contain such other terms and conditions as the Committee, acting in its discretion, may prescribe.
General
th
             3.2          .  The amount, if any, payable to a participant with respect to an award will depend upon whether and the extent to which the performance goal(s) of the award are achieved during the applicable performance period.  Performance goals shall be established on an annual basis and may be established on a corporate-wide basis and/or with respect to operating units, divisions, subsidiaries, acquired businesses, minority investments, partnerships or joint ventures.  The Committee may establish different levels of payment under an award to correspond with different levels of achievement of performance goals specified in the award.  Awards may contain more than one target performance goal.  Multiple performance goals contained in an award may be aggregated, weighted, expressed in the alternativ e or otherwise specified by the Committee.  The level or levels of performance specified with respect to a performance goal may be expressed in absolute terms, as objectives relative to performance in prior periods, as an objective compared to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies, or otherwise as the Committee may determine.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, the performance goals under any award must be objective and must otherwise meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code").
Performance Goals
             3.3          .  Target performance goals may be based upon one or more objective business criteria that apply to the individual participant, one or more business units or subsidiaries or the Company as a whole.  The business criteria shall be as follows, individually or in combination: (i) return on capital; (ii) earnings per share; (iii) net sales; (iv) net earnings; (v) net operating profits; (vi) expense control; (vii) working capital relating to inventory and/or accounts receivable; (viii) operating margin; (ix) share price performance; (x) implementation or completion of critical projects; and (xi) total return to shareholders.
Business Criteria for Performance Goals
             3.4          .  The Committee may reduce or eliminate an award made under the Plan for any reason, including, without limitation, changes in the position or duties of a participant during or after a performance period, whether due to termination of employment (including death, disability, retirement, voluntary termination or termination with or without cause) or otherwise. 
Adjustments
             3.5          .  Following the completion of the performance period applicable to an award, the Committee shall determine and shall certify in writing whether and the extent to which the performance goal(s) under the award have been achieved, as well as the amount, if any, payable to the participant as a result of such achievement(s), which determination(s) and certification(s) shall be subject to and shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Certification
             3.6          .  Subject to such deferral and/or other conditions as may be permitted or required by the Committee, cash amounts earned under an award will be paid or distributed as soon as practicable following the Committee's determination and certification of such amounts.
Payment of Amounts Earned
             3.7          .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no individual may earn more than two million dollars ($2,000,000) in any calendar year pursuant to an award made to such individual under the Plan.
Maximum Annual Amount Payable to a Participant
             3.8          .  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if permitted under Section 409A of the Code, in the event that all or a portion of an annual incentive award shall be ineligible for treatment as "qualified performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the right, with respect to any participant who is a "covered employee" under Section 162(m) of the Code, to defer, in whole or in part, such participant's receipt of payment of his or her annual incentive award until the participant is no longer a "covered employee" or until such time as shall be determined by the  Committee, provided that the  Committee may effect such a deferral only in a situation where the Company would be prohibited a deduction under Section 162(m) of the Code and such deferral shall be limited to the portion of the award that is not deductible.
Deferral
4.          .  No interest in or under an award made or a payment due or to become due under the Plan may be assigned, transferred or otherwise alienated other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any attempted assignment, alienation, sale, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, charge or other alienation of any such interest shall be void and unenforceable.
Non-transferability
5.          .  No award and nothing contained in the Plan or in any document relating to the Plan shall confer upon an eligible employee or participant any right to continue as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary or constitute a contract or agreement of employment.
No Right to Continued Employment
6.          .  The Company (or the relevant subsidiary or affiliate) shall have the right to deduct from all payouts of opportunities hereunder any federal, state, local or foreign taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payouts.

Any such amendment may be made without approval of the Company's shareholders unless and except to the extent such approval is required in order to satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.  The Company's board of directors may terminate the Plan at any time.
Amendment and Termination
8.          .  The Plan shall be unfunded.  The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payout of any award under the Plan.
Unfunded Plan
9.          .
Miscellaneous
             9.1          .  The Plan and any award made under the Plan shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable federal law.
Governing Law
             9.2          .  It is intended that amounts payable pursuant to awards made under the Plan shall constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" and thus be exempt from the annual $1 million limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation.  The Plan and each award made under the Plan will be interpreted, construed and applied accordingly.
Section 162(m) of the Code
             9.3          .  Subject to its approval by the shareholders, the Plan shall become effective for the 2006 fiscal year and shall remain effective until the first annual meeting of shareholders in the 2011 fiscal year, subject to the right of the board of directors of the Company to terminate the Plan.  Any award made under the Plan prior to approval of the shareholders shall be effective as of the date made (unless the Committee specifies otherwise at the time an award is made), but no award may be paid out prior to approval of the Plan by the shareholders.  In addition, if the shareholders fail to approve the Plan, any award made under the Plan shall be cancelled.  The performance criteria specified in the Plan shall be re-submitted for shareholder approval as and when required by Treasury Department r egulations in order to ensure compliance with the shareholder approval requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code on an ongoing basis.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE: ACO) REPORTS 26 PERCENT INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OVER 2005 SECOND QUARTER ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., July 21 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) today reported 2006 second quarter income from continuing operations of $11.9 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with $9.5 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 was $11.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with $14.3 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. In the second quarter of 2005, the Company reported a gain from discontinued operations of $0.15 per diluted share, reflecting income tax refunds associated with the absorbent polymers segment that was sold in the second quarter of 2000. Net sales from continuing operations rose 12 percent to $152.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, compared with $136.3 million for the period in 2005. Operating profit from continuing operations grew over the 2005 second quarter by 10 percent to $14.8 million. Prior-period gross profit and operating profit benefited from a $1.9 million reduction in mining-related taxes due to legislative changes in Montana. Excluding this non-recurring benefit, operating profit would have increased by 28 percent over the 2005 quarter. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2006, net sales from continuing operations were $295.5 million compared to $258.4 million in the prior-year period. Income from continuing operations was $21.6 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared with $16.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share in the same period of 2005. Net income was $21.6 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, compared with $21.2 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, in the same period of 2005. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2005 includes a gain from discontinued operations of $0.15 per diluted share. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the financial overview. Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer said, "AMCOL's second quarter 2006 performance reflects the top-line and earnings momentum of our major segments. Our year-to-date performance reflects 14 percent sales growth, and 24 percent operating profit growth over the 2005 period. Although energy related costs continue to escalate significantly, our revenue improvement is enabling us to maintain strong year over year earnings growth." "In the minerals segment, our Metalcasting Products Group faces a stable, but solid, castings market. Our customers continue to rely on the high value of our products and technical expertise. Pet Products Group's margins are not yet meeting expectations and significant efforts continue on improving the group's operating results. This segment also benefited from high demand for the Petroleum Products Group's clay and lignite products. Asian metalcasting product demand is increasing-resulting in growing sales and profitability." Washow commented. Washow continued, "The environmental segment had another fine quarter, with our European operations profiting from the robust demand for its lining technologies and building materials products. This segment was however, negatively impacted by a slow start in the U.S. west coast construction season. In Asia, we are seeing improved profitability in our lining technology and building material operations due to sales of higher margin products and lower operating costs. The Oilfield Services group contributed another strong quarter globally." Washow added that the environmental segment's second quarter sales were negatively impacted by a slow start in the U.S. west coast construction season.
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Operating Results The Environmental segment accounted for approximately 80 percent of the sales growth in the second quarter. The Minerals segment contributed the remaining increase. Gross margin for the quarter was 26.0 percent compared with 26.8 percent in the prior-year second quarter. The Environmental segment's gross margin for the quarter declined by 20 basis points while the Minerals and Transportation segment's gross margins decreased by 240 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively. As previously mentioned, the 2005 quarter gross profit benefited from a $1.9 million non-recurring tax abatement, which was reported in the Minerals segment. Excluding this benefit, gross margin for the segment would have increased by 10 basis points. General, selling and administrative expenses were $24.9 million in the 2006 second quarter, an increase of $1.8 million or 8 percent over the 2005 period. Research and development expenses were approximately $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2006, compared to $1.9 in the second quarter of 2005. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.7 percent compared with 9.9 percent in the prior-year period. The Company's effective tax rate was 26.6 percent for the second quarter of 2006 versus 24.5 percent for the same period in 2005. The tax rate for the 2005 period benefited from a higher proportion of earnings generated in lower tax jurisdictions. The 2006 period also benefited from favorable tax adjustments. The effective rate for the remainder of year is forecast at approximately 28 percent. Income from affiliates and joint ventures contributed approximately $0.04 per diluted share in the 2006 second quarter compared with $0.01 per diluted share in the prior-year period. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares was 30.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2006, compared with 30.8 million in the prior-year period. Financial Position Long-term debt increased to $52.8 million at June 30, 2006 compared to $34.8 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to greater working capital levels and capital expenditures. Debt represented 16 percent of total capitalization at June 30, 2006, compared with 12 percent at December 31, 2005. Cash and cash equivalents were $13.7 million at June 30, 2006 compared with $16.0 million at the end of 2005. Working capital increased to $169.4 million at June 30, 2006 from $147.9 million at December 31, 2005, which also had the effect of increasing the current ratio to 3.8-to-1 versus 3.3-to-1. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $5.8 million for the year- to-date six months ended June 30, 2006 as compared to $7.0 million in the prior-year period. Capital expenditures amounted to $20.5 million for the year-to-date six months ended June 30, 2006, compared with $11.7 million for the same period in 2005. The increase in 2006 is primarily attributed to new manufacturing sites in Spain and China. During the first six months of 2006, the Company repurchased 120 thousand shares of its common stock for $3.2 million, or an average price of $26.83 per share. $4.8 million remains available in the stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2004.

Exhibit 99.1 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE: ACO) REPORTS INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OVER 2005 THIRD QUARTER ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill., Oct. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) today reported 2006 third quarter income from continuing operations of $16.0 million or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with $11.4 million or $0.37 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. The 2006 third quarter income from continuing operations includes a $0.09 per diluted share net benefit resulting from income tax refunds. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 was $16.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared with $11.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 includes a $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, benefit from discontinued operations, reflecting income tax refunds associated with the absorbent polymers segment that was sold in the second quarter of 2000. Net sales from continuing operations rose 12 percent to $160.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2006, compared with $142.9 million for the period in 2005. Operating profit from continuing operations grew over the 2005 third quarter by 3 percent to $16.4 million. Current period operating profit includes a $0.7 million expense for professional fees relating to the aforementioned amended tax returns, and prior period gross profit and operating profit includes a $0.2 million reduction in mining-related taxes due to legislative changes in Montana. Excluding the effect of these one-time items, operating profit increased 8.5 percent or $1.3 million over the prior year period. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2006, income from continuing operations was $37.7 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, compared with $27.9 million, or $0.91 per diluted share in the same period of 2005. As previously mentioned in this release, the current-year period includes a $0.09 per share net benefit from income tax refunds. Net income was $38.2 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared with $32.7 million, or $1.06 per diluted share, in the same period of 2005. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2006 and 2005 includes a gain from discontinued operations of $0.02 and $0.15 per diluted share, respectively. Net sales from continuing operations were $455.6 million for the nine- month period ended September 30, 2006, compared with $401.3 million in the prior-year period, or an increase of 13.5 percent. Operating profit for the period was $43.3 million compared with $37.7 million in 2005, or an increase of 15 percent. The current period operating profit includes a $0.7 million expense for professional fees relating to amended tax returns, and prior period gross profit and operating profit benefited from a $2.1 million reduction in mining-related taxes due to legislative changes in Montana. Excluding the effect of these one-time items, operating profit increased 23.6 percent or $8.4 million over the prior year period. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the financial overview. In the third quarter of 2006, we began capturing discrete financial information for our Oilfield services business and reporting it separately. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we have revised our segment reporting to reflect the way we now manage and view our business - with Oilfield services segment reported separately from our Environmental segment. We have also recast the segment information for prior periods to conform to this new presentation.
Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer said, "Overall we had a productive quarter, both operationally and financially, with diluted earnings per share up over the third quarter of 2005 and several targeted investments completed. Our worldwide operations reported strong results, benefiting from our Asian mineral groups and our European environmental groups. The U.S. metalcasting market has shown a flattening, but oil drilling continues to be strong." Washow continued, "We have provided detailed information on our Oilfield Services segment which has built a unique platform and our third quarter results highlight the effectiveness of this segment. I am particularly pleased with our portfolio evolution, demonstrating the attractiveness of our product offering to customers." "Compared to the strong third quarter the Environmental segment had in 2005, the segment again had strong sales, offset by weaker than expected margins. We experienced margin pressure from our newest group, Contracting Services, which contributed to the segment's sales but is not yet adding to the bottom line. This Group is working to attain the profit margins we had expected for this business," Washow commented. Washow added that the Environmental segment's third quarter general, selling and administrative expenses were impacted by increased staffing needs to meet the sales demands but has remained constant at about 19 percent of sales. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Third-Quarter Operating Results The Environmental segment accounted for approximately 54 percent of the sales growth in the third quarter. The Minerals segment contributed 29 percent and the Oilfield Services segment contributed 17 percent, while the Transportation segment was flat. Gross margin for the quarter was 26.4 percent compared with 26.7 percent in the prior-year third quarter. The Oilfield Services segment's gross margin for the quarter increased 340 basis points while the Environmental and Minerals segments' gross margin declined by 230 and 30 basis points, respectively. The Transportation segment's gross margins decreased by 20 basis points. General, selling and administrative expenses were $25.8 million in the 2006 third quarter, an increase of $3.7 million or 17 percent over the 2005 period. Higher personnel-related costs in the Environmental and Oilfield Services segments were the primary causes for the increase. Professional fees related to the amended income tax returns accounted for approximately $0.7 million of the increase. Research and development expenses remained constant at $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2006 versus the third quarter of 2005. The nanocomposites business, which is included in the Corporate segment, benefited from one-time adjustments totaling approximately $0.2 million related to depreciation and obsolete inventory reserves. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.2 percent compared with 11.2 percent in the prior-year period. The margin decline was principally impacted by higher general, selling and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased by approximately $0.4 million over the prior- year quarter due to higher average debt levels and increased interest rates. Other expense for the period was $0.3 million compared with income of $0.2 million in 2005. The change was primarily attributed to foreign exchange losses incurred at the European subsidiaries. The Company's effective tax rate was 8.0 percent for the third quarter of 2006 versus 33.1 percent for the same period in 2005. The 2006 period benefited from favorable tax reductions of approximately $3.4 million relating to amended tax returns, while the 2005 period included a charge of $1.5 million for write-off of tax receivables. Excluding the effect of both of these adjustments, the comparative third quarter effective tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 29 percent and 23.9 percent, respectively.
Income from affiliates and joint ventures contributed approximately $0.06 per diluted share in the 2006 third quarter compared with $0.03 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Higher profits earned at the Company's Indian-based investments led to the increase. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares was constant at 30.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 and 2005. Financial Position Long-term debt increased to $60.1 million at September 30, 2006 compared to $34.8 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to greater working capital levels, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Debt represented 18 percent of total capitalization at September 30, 2006, compared with 12 percent at December 31, 2005. Cash and cash equivalents were $15.3 million at September 30, 2006 compared with $16.0 million at the end of 2005. Working capital increased to $167.9 million at September 30, 2006 from $147.9 million at December 31, 2005; our current ratio remained relatively constant. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $29.0 million for the year- to-date nine months ended September 30, 2006 as compared with $17.4 million in the prior-year period. Higher net income and a lower increase in working capital contributed to the improvement over the 2005 period. Capital expenditures amounted to $30.0 million for the year-to-date nine months ended September 30, 2006, compared with $20.0 million for the same period in 2005. The increase is primarily due to investments within the Minerals segment manufacturing plants. The Company expended $11.7 million for acquisitions in the 2006 period, including approximately $10.5 million in the third quarter for a business included in the Oilfield Services segment. During the first nine months of 2006, the Company repurchased 220 thousand shares of its common stock for $5.6 million, or an average price of $25.24 per share. The stock repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in May 2004 expired in the third quarter of 2006.

NSC shall review such estimates with Buyer prior to Closing in such detail as Buyer may reasonably request, and NSC shall provide such supporting detail and other cooperation as Buyer may reasonably request to support Buyer's review and analysis of such estimates prior to Closing. Subject to mutual agreement, the parties may update the estimates for changes occurring during the five (5) business days preceding the Closing. 2.2 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the Purchased Assets shall be the amount of Thirty Three Million Dollars ($33,000,000), subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2.3 below (the "Purchase Price"). Such Purchase Price shall be payable as follows and as set forth in Section 2.3. (a) At Closing, Buyer shall deliver a sum equal to Thirty Three Million Dollars ($33,000,000) less the amounts to be escrowed under subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 2.2 below, to NSC in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the bank account designated in writing by NSC. (b) At Closing, Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent the sum of Three Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($3,300,000) (the "Indemnification Escrow Deposit") to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 8.6 and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 6
(c) At Closing, Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, a sum equal to the Estimated Aged Accounts Amount (the "Aged Accounts Escrow Deposit") to be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.2(c) and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. During the Escrow Period, the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts in the ordinary course of business and consistent with Buyer's past practices to collect the Aged Accounts. NSC shall forward to Buyer on a weekly basis during the Escrow Period all payments that it receives on the Aged Accounts or any other accounts receivable of the Business, together with an accounting therefor. Within twenty-five (25) days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Escrow Period, Buyer shall deliver to NSC a report setting forth a summary of the Aged Accounts that were collected by Buyer during such preceding calendar quarter or portion thereof, and Buyer and NSC shall jointly direct Escrow Agent to pay such amount, together with interest earned thereon, to NSC from the Aged Accounts Escrow Deposit. Buyer shall apply all payments received from customers on and after the Closing Date to the respective customer's oldest accounts first, unless a debtor indicates the specific account or invoice it is paying in which event payment shall be applied to that account or invoice. Buyer and NSC agree that they will not willfully influence account specification pursuant to the preceding sentence (although Buyer may contact an account debtor to inquire or confirm whether a particular payment is intended for a particular invoice if not otherwise indicated from the payment). Buyer and NSC shall cooperate with each other in communicating and making sure that payments on the accounts receivable of the Business are allocated to the correct invoice and any payments thereon received by NSC are forwarded to Buyer. Buyer's management, including CA, shall have authority to settle, compromise and collect the Aged Accounts in such manner as they determine during the Escrow Period utilizing commercially reasonable standards. Within twenty-five (25) days after the end of the Escrow Period, Buyer shall deliver to NSC a final summary of the Aged Accounts that were collected or settled by Buyer during the Escrow Period (the "Aged Accounts Report"). Upon receipt of the Aged Accounts Report, NSC shall have a period of up to thirty (30) days to review the Aged Accounts Report. If NSC approves the Aged Accounts Report or does not notify Buyer in writing during such thirty (30) day period that it disputes the Aged Accounts Report, the Aged Accounts Report shall become the Final Aged Accounts Report. If NSC notifies Buyer in writing within such thirty (30) day period that it disputes the Aged Account Report, indicating the items it disputes, the disputed items shall be resolved by the Arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.3.4, and upon resolution, the Aged Accounts Report, as modified, if at all, by arbitration, shall become the Final Aged Accounts Report. Any Aged Accounts that remain outstanding as of the end of the Escrow Period, as shown on the Final Aged Accounts Report, are referred to herein as the "Uncollected Aged Accounts." Within five (5) business days of the determination of the Final Aged Accounts Report, NSC and Buyer shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay out of the Escrow Deposit (i) an amount equal to the face amount of the Uncollected Aged Accounts (plus interest accrued thereon) to Buyer, and (ii) an amount equal to the remaining amount of the Aged Accounts Escrow Deposit (plus interest accrued thereon) to NSC. Upon such payments, Buyer shall assign to NSC, without recourse or warranty, the Uncollected Aged Accounts, if any. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither NSC or its Members or any of their respective affiliates shall take any action or file any lawsuits to collect or enforce any of the Uncollected Aged Accounts, nor shall NSC sell or transfer any of the Uncollected Aged Accounts, except as otherwise expressly permitted by Section 12(e) hereof. Buyer shall promptly remit to NSC any amounts subsequently received by Buyer with respect to the Uncollected Aged Accounts assigned to NSC hereunder. The parties agree that in no event will Buyer or NSC be entitled to receive any portion of the Aged Accounts Receivable Amount under this Agreement except as specifically set forth in this Section 2.2(c). 7
2.3 Adjustment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment for the amount by which the Closing Working Capital Amount reflected in the Final Closing Statements exceeds (or is less than) Two Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,200,000), such adjustment to be payable as and determined in the manner described below. 2.3.1 Payment of Preliminary Working Capital Adjustment at Closing. At Closing, in addition to the payments set forth in Section 2.2, Buyer shall deliver to NSC a sum equal to the Preliminary Working Capital Adjustment in immediately available funds by wire transfer to the bank account designated in writing by NSC. 2.3.2 Initial Closing Statements. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and in any event no later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, NSC will prepare and present to Buyer the Initial Closing Statements, which shall consist of the following statements reflecting the respective values as at 11:59 P.M. on the day preceding the Closing: (i) a balance sheet of NSC consisting of the assets and liabilities of NSC, prepared in accordance with US GAAP, except that all known adjustments will be made without regard to materiality (the "Initial Closing Balance Sheet"); (ii) a schedule adjusting the Initial Closing Balance Sheet for any Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities recorded therein which Buyer is not purchasing or assuming according to the terms of this Agreement (the "Purchased Balance Sheet"); (iii) a report of accounts receivable included in the Purchased Balance Sheet that shows, by invoice by customer, the amount of receivables recorded and aged in categories of 30 day increments from invoice date (the "Closing Aged Receivables Report"), and setting forth therein a listing of the Aged Accounts and a summary of the Aged Accounts Amount; and (iv) a calculation of the amount of closing working capital (the "Closing Working Capital Amount"), which shall be the current assets less current liabilities as defined in accordance with US GAAP contained in the Purchased Balance Sheet less Two Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,200,000). 2.3.3 Final Closing Statements. Upon receipt of the Initial Closing Statements, Buyer and its independent accountants ("Buyer's Accountants") shall be permitted during the succeeding sixty (60) day period to examine the books and records of NSC and the work papers prepared by NSC or NSC's accountants. If Buyer agrees to the Initial Closing Statements, they shall become the Final Closing Statements. If Buyer does not agree to the Initial Closing Statements it shall within sixty (60) calendar days after delivery of the Initial Closing Statements by NSC, prepare and deliver to NSC a list of disputed adjustments (the "Disputed Adjustments") Buyer believes should have been recorded on the Initial Closing Statements. Buyer and NSC shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to resolve the Disputed Adjustments. If Buyer and NSC are able to reach an agreement on the Disputed Adjustments, the Initial Closing Statements shall be amended to reflect such agreement and shall become the Final Closing Statements. 8
If Buyer and NSC are unable to reach an agreement on the Disputed Adjustments within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt by NSC of the Disputed Adjustments, then the matter will be resolved by the Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3.4 below. The Final Closing Statements shall be deemed to be and shall be conclusive and binding on the parties to this Agreement for purposes of determining any adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.3. 2.3.4 Disputes. For purposes of this dispute resolution provision, NSC and the Members hereby appoint CA as the "NSC Representative" and authorize him to act on its and their behalf. NSC shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Disputed Adjustments to dispute any calculations or amounts reflected therein. If the NSC Representative does not give Buyer written notice of such a dispute, specifying the grounds therefor, within such thirty (30) day period, the Disputed Adjustments shall be deemed to have been accepted by NSC and the Members in the form in which it was delivered by Buyer. In the event that the NSC Representative gives such written notice to Buyer within such thirty (30) day period, the NSC Representative and Buyer shall, within twenty (20) days after the giving thereof, attempt to resolve the dispute and agree in writing upon the final content of the Disputed Adjustments. In the event that the NSC Representative and Buyer are unable to resolve any such dispute within such twenty (20) day period, then a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to the NSC Representative and Buyer shall be employed as arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") hereunder to settle such dispute as soon as practicable. The Arbitrator shall have access to all documents and facilities necessary to perform its function as arbitrator. The Arbitrator's determination with respect to any such dispute shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. NSC and Buyer shall each pay one half (1/2) of the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator for such services. 2.3.5 Payment of Adjustment to Closing Working Capital Amount. Within ten (10) calendar days after the Final Closing Statements are determined and become final, either (i) if the Preliminary Working Capital Adjustment is greater than the Closing Working Capital Amount reflected in the Final Closing Statements, NSC shall be responsible to pay Buyer in immediately available funds the amount of such difference, or (ii) if the Preliminary Working Capital Adjustment is less than the Closing Working Capital Amount reflected in the Final Closing Statements, Buyer shall pay to NSC in immediately available funds the amount of such difference. If monies are owing from NSC to Buyer under this subsection 2.3.5, then such amounts, together with interest earned thereon, shall be paid to Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Deposit in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; provided, however, in the event and to the extent that such amounts are not paid to Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Deposit for any reason within ten (10) days of when due and owing, NSC shall pay such amounts to Buyer upon written demand therefor. 9

The parties agree that to the extent that another representation or warranty given by NSC in this Section 4 relates more specifically to a particular type of liability or obligation, that such other representation or warranty shall supersede the more general representation and warranty of this Section 4.9 with respect thereto. 4.10 Absence of Certain Changes.

NSC has not received any written notice from a taxing authority of a jurisdiction where NSC does not file Tax returns claiming that it is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. There are no liens for Taxes on any of the Purchased Assets that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax, and, there is no basis for assertion of any claims attributable to Taxes which, if adversely determined, would result in any such liens. There is no pending, or to NSC's and the Members' knowledge, threatened or anticipated assessment of any additional Tax against NSC for any taxable period for which Tax returns have been filed which may cause the Purchased Assets to be subject to an encumbrance. 12
4.12 Title to and Condition of Assets. NSC is the owner of and has good title to all of the Purchased Assets, including those assets and properties reflected in the Financial Statements (other than those properties and assets disposed of since August 31, 2006, in the ordinary course of business), and to all properties and assets acquired by NSC after such date, free and clear of all mortgages, liens, pledges, charges, security interests, encumbrances or other third party interests of any nature whatsoever.

To the Knowledge of NSC, the real property and the buildings thereon utilized by NSC in the conduct of the Business do not violate any building, zoning or other laws or ordinances, or any agreements, applicable thereto, and no notice of any such violation or claimed violation has been received by NSC or any of the Members. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.13, NSC's right, title and interest in and to each of the real property leases shall continue after the completion of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the consent, waiver or approval of any party and such transactions will not give any party thereto the right to terminate the lease. 13

The party claiming indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnitee") will give prompt written notice ("Notice of Claim") to the party from whom such indemnification is sought (the "Indemnitor") of any claim ("Claim") which it discovers or of which it receives notice after the Closing and which might give rise to a Claim by it against the Indemnitor under Section 8 hereof, stating the nature, basis and (to the extent known or reasonably estimated) amount thereof; provided that failure to give prompt notice shall not jeopardize the right of any Indemnitee to indemnification unless such failure shall have materially prejudiced the ability of the Indemnitor to defend or minimize the amount of such Claim.

If Indemnitor actually assumes the defense of the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall have sole control of the defense and negotiations for the settlement or compromise of such Claim, the Indemnitee will not make any settlement of any Claim which might give rise to liability of any of the Indemnitor under the indemnity agreements contained in this Section without the written consent of Indemnitor, and the Indemnitor shall not agree to make any settlement of any Claim which would not include the unconditional release of the Indemnitee without the written consent of Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. 27

The Members and NSC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recover any such amount to which it or they are entitled under any insurance policy, provided that neither the Members nor NSC shall be required to initiate or maintain any litigation to recover any such amount. 8.8 Exclusive Rights and Remedies. The provisions of this Article 8 shall be the exclusive basis of the parties to this Agreement for (i) any breach of a representation or warranty herein and (ii) any failure of a party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein. 9. Noncompete; Confidentiality; Nonsolicitation. Except as -------------------------------------------- expressly set forth in that certain Retention Agreement dated as of even date herewith between Christopher M. Abide and Buyer, in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NSC and all of the goodwill of NSC by Buyer, for a period ending three (3) years after the Closing Date, neither NSC, the Members nor their respective family members or Affiliates shall engage in a business which competes with the business of NSC as conducted on the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, personally or as an employee, owner, consultant, manager, associate, partner, agent or otherwise, or by means of any corporate or other device within the onshore and offshore markets of the states of Louisiana (and the parishes thereof as listed on Schedule 9 hereof), Mississippi, Alabama and Texas (such geographic area is hereafter referred to as the "Territory"); nor shall the Members or their family members or Affiliates for such period and in the Territory solicit orders, directly or indirectly from any customer of Buyer or NSC, for any product or service substantially similar to those sold, manufactured or distributed by NSC as conducted on the Closing Date, personally or as an employee, owner, consultant, manager, associate, partner, agent or otherwise, or by means of any corporate or other device; nor shall the Members or their Affiliates for such period and in the Territory solicit for employment any employee of NSC who continued employment after the Closing Date. 29
The Members further acknowledges that by reason of their affiliation with NSC, they have had access to confidential information of NSC. The Members covenant and agree that the Members shall not use for their own benefit or divulge to any third party any confidential information or trade secrets of Buyer or NSC. As used herein, confidential information shall consist of all information, knowledge or data relating to the business of NSC (including without limit all information relating to inventions, production methods, customer and prospective customer lists, prices and trade practices) which is not in the public domain or otherwise published or publicly available. This Section 9 shall not be construed to prohibit the ownership by the Members of not more than five percent (5%) of the capital stock of any corporation having a class of securities registered pursuant to the Exchange Act of 1934. The Members acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this Section 9 are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of Buyer in connection with its purchase of all of the goodwill of NSC, do not cause the Members undue hardship, and that any violations of any provision of this Section 9 will result in irreparable injury to Buyer and that, therefore, Buyer shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without having to post any bond, in any court of competent jurisdiction and to an equitable accounting of all earnings, profits and other benefits arising from such violation, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which Buyer may be entitled. 10. Certain Tax Matters. ------------------- (a) Payment of Taxes on the Sale of the Purchased Assets. All sales, recording, title transfer and registration and other transfer Taxes payable by reason of the sale or transfer of the Purchased Assets (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Responsible Party, as herein defined; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall pay any transfer fees or sales taxes for any titled vehicles included in the Purchased Assets. As used herein, the Responsible Party shall be Buyer, except with respect to Transfer Taxes which are solely the responsibility of the seller of assets as a matter of law, in which case the Responsible Party shall be NSC. To the extent that a party other than the Responsible Party is required to file tax returns relating to Transfer Taxes (the "Filing Party"), the Filing Party shall prepare such tax returns and provide copies thereof to the Responsible Party prior to filing such tax returns. Upon filing such tax returns relating to Transfer Taxes, the Filing Party shall make payment of such Transfer Taxes, whereupon the Responsible Party shall reimburse the Filing Party for the amount so paid, provided that the Responsible Party may elect to make payment directly to the applicable Governmental Body, in which case the parties shall cooperate to coordinate the filing of the applicable tax returns and payment of the corresponding Transfer Taxes. To the extent that any Governmental Body seeks to collect Transfer Taxes from any party other than the Responsible Party, the Responsible Party shall pay, or reimburse such other party for payment of, such Transfer Taxes, provided that such other party shall give prompt notice to the Responsible Party of any such collection efforts and shall permit the Responsible Party to control any proceedings contesting any such Transfer Taxes. Each party agrees to cooperate with the other to qualify for any exemptions for Transfer Taxes, and to execute any and all resale certificates or other documents or other forms reasonably necessary to qualify for any such exemptions. 30
(b) Mutual Cooperation. Buyer and NSC shall each assist the other as may reasonably be requested by either of them with the preparation of any Tax Return, any Tax audit, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to any Tax. In addition, each party shall retain and provide the other with any records or information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, Tax audit, proceeding or determination. The party requesting assistance under this Section shall reimburse the party providing assistance for direct out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such assistance. 11. Publicity. Neither party shall issue any press release or --------- otherwise make any announcements to the public regarding this Agreement or the contemplated transactions, including the amount of the Purchase Price, without the prior written consent of the other party, except as required by any applicable legal requirements; provided, however, unless legally required, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Members unnamed in any press release concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall keep this Agreement and its contents strictly confidential, except as required by any applicable legal requirements; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11, this Agreement shall not be deemed to limit or restrict Buyer or its affiliates in any manner from filing a Form 8-K concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and attaching a full copy of this Agreement to such filing to the extent determined by Buyer or its affiliates to be necessary or desirable in connection with the conduct of its business. Prior to the Closing, the parties shall consult concerning the means by which the employees, customers, and suppliers and others having dealings with NSC will be informed of the contemplated transactions. 12. Certain Transitional Matters. ---------------------------- (a) Endorsement of Checks. Buyer shall have the right and authority to retain and endorse without recourse the name of NSC on any check or any other evidences of Indebtedness received by Buyer on account of the Business and arising from the Purchased Assets. To the extent that Buyer comes into the possession of any check or any other evidences of Indebtedness received by Buyer and relating to the Excluded Assets, Buyer shall promptly deliver the same to NSC. (b) Remit Funds. After the Closing, NSC shall promptly transfer and deliver to Buyer any cash or other property, if any, that is included in the Purchased Assets received by NSC. After the Closing, Buyer shall promptly transfer and deliver to NSC any cash or other property, if any, that is included in the Excluded Assets and is received by Buyer. 31
(c) Assumed Liabilities Controlled by Buyer. Buyer shall have complete control over the payment, settlement or other disposition of, or any dispute involving, any Assumed Liability, and Buyer shall have the right to conduct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto. NSC and the Members shall notify Buyer promptly of any claim made against NSC or any Member with respect to any Assumed Liability. (d) Assistance. NSC and the Members shall cooperate with and assist Buyer and its authorized representatives in order to provide, to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, an efficient transfer of control of the Purchased Assets and to avoid any undue interruption in the activities and operations of the Business. (e) Retained Liabilities Controlled by NSC. NSC shall have complete control over the payment, settlement or other disposition of, or any dispute involving, any Retained Liability, and NSC shall have the right to conduct and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect thereto; provided, however, that in no event shall NSC or the Members or any of their respective Affiliates file any suit or institute or maintain any collection or enforcement actions against any current or former customer of the Business without in each case the prior written consent of the Buyer, except that NSC may enforce and collect any Uncollected Aged Account reassigned to NSC under the terms of Section 2.2(c) after the end of the Escrow Period if the account debtor thereon (i) is subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding at the time, or (ii) is an account debtor specified on Schedule 12(e) for which Buyer has separately agreed prior to Closing that it will not object to collection actions by NSC. Buyer shall notify NSC promptly of any claim made against Buyer with respect to any Retained Liability. (f) Change of Seller's Name. Within one (1) business day after the Closing, Seller shall file appropriate documents with the Secretary of State of Louisiana and those other jurisdictions listed on Schedule 4.4 in which NSC is qualified to do business to change the corporate name of NSC and to transfer its interests in the trade names and coordinate with Buyer to allow Buyer to simultaneously file such corporate documents as may be reasonably necessary for Buyer to acquire the rights to each corporate name should it so desire. (g) Insurance. Buyer shall be obligated to procure its own insurance on the Business commencing on the Closing Date. NSC shall be solely responsible for receiving a refund of any insurance premium payments that have been prepaid. (h) Ad Valorem Taxes. With regard to ad valorem Taxes on the Purchased Assets for the 2006 tax year, NSC and Buyer agree that such Taxes shall be prorated between NSC and Buyer as of the Closing Date such that NSC shall be responsible for (and shall pay to Buyer or accrue on the preliminary closing balance sheet delivered under Section 2.1 and on the Final Closing Statements an amount equal to) all ad valorem Taxes attributable to or incurred with respect to the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing Date and Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay to the appropriate Governmental Authorities all ad valorem Taxes attributable to or incurred with respect to the Purchased Assets on or after the Closing Date. On or prior to the due date, Buyer shall pay to the appropriate authorities all amounts of ad valorem taxes on the Purchased Assets due and owing to the appropriate Government Authorities including but not limited to the amounts paid to Buyer by NSC for NSC's pro rata share of such ad valorem Taxes. 32
(i) Assignment of Contracts. To the extent that the assignment of any Contract shall require the consent of a governmental authority or third party, and Buyer shall have waived the obtaining of such consent prior to Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a contract to assign the same until such consent is obtained. NSC and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable efforts after Closing to obtain any consent necessary to any such assignment. If any such consent is not obtained, (i) this Agreement shall not constitute or be deemed to be a contract to assign the same if an attempted assignment without such consent, approval or waiver would constitute a breach of such Contracts or create in any party thereto the right or power to cancel or terminate such Contracts; and (ii) NSC and Members will cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer's expense, in any reasonable arrangement requested by Buyer and designed to provide to Buyer the benefit, monetary or otherwise, of NSC's rights under such Contracts, including enforcement of any and all rights of NSC and Members against the other party thereto arising out of a breach or cancellation thereof by such other party, and to the extent Buyer is afforded the benefits thereunder, Buyer shall perform NSC's obligations thereunder. 13. Severance, Change of Control and Termination Payments. ----------------------------------------------------- NSC shall (a) pay, perform and discharge any and all severance payments and other Liabilities with respect to employees of NSC that result from the transfer of the Purchased Assets hereunder and the employment by Buyer of those employees, whether or not described as a "change of control", "termination" or similar term, and (b) indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its directors, officers, and Affiliates from and against any and all Damages, that any of the aforesaid may suffer or incur by reason of or relating to any Liabilities referred to in clause (a) above. 14. Certain Employment Matters. Buyer shall offer employment to -------------------------- all or substantially all of the employees of NSC (all of such employees accepting employment with Buyer as of the Closing (including CA), the "Transferring Employees"). Buyer's offer of employment will be made subject to Buyer's standard employment practices and the satisfactory completion of Buyer's employment process, including, without limitation, completion of a background check and drug screen for each employee. The salaries offered to the Transferring Employees at Closing will be generally similar to the salaries paid by NSC, and the benefits offered to the Transferring Employees will be consistent with the benefits generally provided to Buyer's other employees; provided, however, that the employment terms offered to CA, Stephen Conner and James Coronato shall be the terms set forth in their respective offer letters and/or Retention Agreements, as applicable. NSC and the Members shall cooperate with Buyer in the dissemination of such offers of employment together with any appropriate related documentation such as applications for employment, tax and benefit forms and the like and provide Buyer with reasonable assistance in the collection thereof. Buyer shall treat the prior service of Transferring Employees with NSC as service rendered to Buyer for purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder, except where such service crediting would violate applicable laws or require Buyer, under applicable laws, to increase benefits for its other employees; provided, however, that such prior service shall not be credited for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan of Buyer. 33
15. Benefit Plan Matters. As of the Closing Date, each of the -------------------- Transferring Employees who has an account balance in any defined contribution plan, savings or retirement plan (the "Defined Contribution Plans") maintained by NSC shall be deemed fully vested in, and entitled to receive a distribution of, his or her entire account balance following the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, the Transferring Employees shall cease to be eligible to make or receive contributions under the Defined Contribution Plans of NSC; provided, however, that any contribution required to be made with respect to the participation of the Transferring Employees in such Defined Contribution Plans on or immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be made by NSC in accordance with NSC's standard administrative practice for such Defined Contribution Plans. Similarly, as of the Closing Date, each of the Transferring Employees who has an accrued benefit in any defined benefit retirement plan maintained by NSC (the "Defined Benefit Plans") shall be deemed fully vested in, and entitled to receive a distribution of, his or her entire accrued benefit in accordance with the terms of the Defined Benefit Plans. As of the Closing Date, the Transferring Employees shall cease to be eligible to participate in the Defined Benefit Plans of NSC; provided, however, that any contribution required to be made with respect to the participation of the Transferring Employees in such Defined Benefit Plans on or immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be made by NSC in accordance with NSC's standard administrative practice for such Defined Benefit Plans. NSC shall retain all liability for any and all Benefit Plans of NSC (all of which are intended to be included in Retained Liabilities), including plans, programs and arrangements which provide medical and dental coverage and life and accident insurance, disability insurance for the Transferring Employees (or their eligible dependents) with respect to claims incurred prior to the Closing Date and Buyer shall be responsible for all liability for any and all welfare benefit plans of Buyer with respect to claims incurred on or after the Closing Date. For the foregoing purposes, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred on the date on which medical or other treatment or service was rendered and not the date of inception of an illness or injury or the date on which a claim for treatment or service is submitted. At or prior to Closing, NSC shall pay all bonuses, whether or not accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet, but payable to any Transferring Employees who are eligible for any such payment pursuant to NSC's bonus plan as of the Closing. No severance payment or other benefit will be due to the Transferring Employee solely as a result of the sale of the Business as contemplated by this Agreement. 16. Product Liability and Product Warranties. ---------------------------------------- (a) Products Liability. NSC shall be liable for all express and implied products liability for all products shipped, distributed, assembled or sold by, or any services provided by, NSC prior to the Closing Date.

(b) Products and Service Warranties. Except as set forth in the last sentence of this Section, Buyer shall, subject to reimbursement by NSC upon invoicing therefor as provided in this Section, be responsible for all express product and services warranty obligations made by NSC prior to Closing. Buyer agrees to notify NSC promptly of any notice or claims for warranty work respecting products sold or services rendered by NSC which Buyer receives following the Closing and to perform such warranty work only if commercially reasonable in accordance with CETCO's practices. Buyer shall invoice NSC at Buyer's cost for parts and materials used, in satisfying such product warranty obligations provided that Buyer shall not invoice NSC for any such parts, materials or services unless at such time the aggregate amount owing by NSC to Buyer in respect of such parts, materials or services equals or exceeds $5,000. Upon receipt by NSC from Buyer of any invoice in respect of parts, materials and services furnished in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, NSC shall be responsible to pay to Buyer the amount of such invoice. If monies are owing from NSC to Buyer under the terms of this Section 16(b), then such amounts shall be paid to Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Deposit in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; provided, however, in the event and to the extent that such amounts are not paid to Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Deposit for any reason within ten (10) days of when due and owing, NSC shall pay such amounts to Buyer upon written demand therefor. Buyer shall, at its own cost and expense, be responsible for all express product and service warranty obligations made by NSC prior to Closing if such warranty obligations result directly from any product assembled or manufactured by, or any service provided by, Buyer. 17. General Provisions. NSC, the Members and Buyer further ------------------ covenant and agree as follows: 17.1 Waiver of Terms.

Castagna Senior Vice President & CFO 847.394.8730 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE:ACO) REPORTS 44 PERCENT INCREASE IN FOURTH QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OVER 2005 ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL., JANUARY 19, 2007--AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2006 fourth quarter income from continuing operations of $12.0 million or $0.39 per diluted share, compared with $8.4 million or $0.27 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. The current-year period benefited from a lower effective income tax rate ($0.03 per diluted share). Net sales from continuing operations rose 16 percent to $155.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2006, compared with $134.6 million for the 2005 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $8.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of the fourth-quarter sales growth. Operating profit from continuing operations improved by 50 percent to $14.1 million over the 2005 period. Current-period operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2006, income from continuing operations was $49.7 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared with $36.3 million, or $1.18 per diluted share in the same period of 2005. A lower effective tax rate in 2006 accounted for $0.12 per diluted share of the earnings growth. Net income in 2006 was $50.2 million, or $1.62 per diluted share, compared with $41.0 million, or $1.33 per diluted share, in 2005. Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 includes a gain from discontinued operations of $0.02 and $0.15 per diluted share, respectively. MORE
AMCOL Q4 2006 EARNINGS PAGE 2 OF 11 Net sales from continuing operations were $611.6 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2006, compared with $535.9 million in the prior-year period, or an increase of 14 percent. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $16.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of the sales growth over 2005. Operating profit for the period was $57.4 million compared with $47.1 million in 2005, or an increase of 22 percent. Current-year operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $1.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the financial overview. Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer said, "Overall we had another quarter of growth from our traditional operations as well as contributions from recent acquisitions. After considering the effect of an acquisition, our metalcasting sales decreased in the quarter, however, our sales in the Asia-Pacific region continued to expand. Specialty minerals revenues, including our detergent additives product line, also improved." Washow also noted, "The acquisition in October of additional metalcasting operations in the U.S. will position us well to serve this core market." Washow stated, "Oilfield Services represented an important part of the improvement. Besides continued growth in our base business, the two acquisitions completed this year have integrated well and expanded the product and service portfolio we can offer to our customers." "Compared to the strong fourth quarter the Environmental segment had in 2005, the segment again had strong sales, offset by somewhat weaker margins. We have seen an impact on margins primarily from our service related businesses but we are encouraged that the Contracting Services Group was a contributor in the fourth quarter" Washow commented. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Fourth Quarter Operating Results The following table details the consolidated sales growth components in the quarter: BASE FOREIGN BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS EXCHANGE TOTAL -------- ------------ -------- ------- Minerals 0.0% 3.2% 1.4% 4.6% Environmental 4.7% - 1.6% 6.3% Oilfield Services 2.8% 2.8% 0.2% 5.8% Transportation -0.9% - - -0.9% -------- ------------ -------- ------- Total 6.6% 6.0% 3.2% 15.8% ======== ============ ======== ======= MORE
AMCOL Q4 2006 EARNINGS PAGE 3 OF 11 Gross margin for the quarter was 26.8 percent compared with 25.0 percent in the prior-year fourth quarter. The Oilfield Services segment experienced a 460 basis point improvement in gross margin, which accounted for the entire improvement in the consolidated results. General, selling and administrative expenses were $27.7 million in the 2006 fourth quarter, an increase of $3.5 million or 14 percent over the 2005 period. The Minerals, Environmental and Oilfield Services segments all experienced increases over the 2005 quarter. Higher general operating and amortization expenses in the current quarter and one-time benefits recorded in the 2005 period accounted for the increase in the Minerals segment. The Environmental and Oilfield Services segments reported higher personnel-related costs. Additionally, the Oilfield Services segment recorded amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions completed in 2006. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.0 percent compared with 7.0 percent in the prior-year period. The improvement was principally due to increased profitability in the Oilfield Services segment. Net interest expense increased by approximately $0.7 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels and increased interest rates. The current-year quarter benefited from a one-time adjustment of $0.2 million for interest income received from a loan to one of our equity investments. The Company's effective tax rate was 14.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2006 versus 21.1 percent for the same period in 2005. The 2006 period benefited from estimate changes for depletion deductions, state income taxes and a research and development credit, which Congress reenacted in December, 2006. Income from affiliates and joint ventures contributed approximately $0.03 per diluted share in both reporting periods. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares was 31.0 million and 30.8 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Financial Position Long-term debt increased to $112.4 million at December 31, 2006 compared to $34.8 million at December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily due to greater working capital levels, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Debt represented 28 percent of total capitalization at December 31, 2006, compared with 12 percent at December 31, 2005. Cash and cash equivalents were $17.8 million at December 31, 2006 compared with $16.0 million at the end of 2005. MORE
AMCOL Q4 2006 EARNINGS PAGE 4 OF 11 Working capital increased to $173.3 million at December 31, 2006 from $147.9 million at December 31, 2005; our current ratio remained relatively constant. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $46.8 million for the year-to-date twelve months ended December 31, 2006 as compared with $36.3 million in the prior-year period. Higher net income was the primary contributor to the improvement over the 2005 period. Capital expenditures amounted to $42.1 million for the year-to-date twelve months ended December 31, 2006, compared with $28.6 million for the same period in 2005. The increase is primarily due to investments within the Minerals segment manufacturing plants. The Company expended $63.2 million for acquisitions in the 2006 period, including approximately $30.6 million in the fourth quarter for a business included in the Oilfield Services segment and $20.5 million for a metalcasting business in the U.S. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock.

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT. On April 2, 2007, AMCOL International Corporation (the "Company") issued and sold an aggregate of $75 million of its senior notes (the "Notes") to a qualified institutional buyer pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated as of April 2, 2007 (the "Note Purchase Agreement"). The Notes are comprised of (a) $45 million aggregate principal amount of its Series 2007-A Adjustable Fixed Rate Guaranteed Senior Notes, Tranche 1, due April 2, 2017 (the "Tranche 1 Notes") and (b) $30 million aggregate principal amount of Series 2007-A Adjustable Floating Rate Guaranteed Senior Notes, Tranche 2, due April 2, 2017 (the "Tranche 2 Notes"). The unpaid principal amount of the Tranche 1 Notes bears interest at an annual rate of 5.78%, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 2nd and October 2nd of each year, beginning October 2, 2007. The unpaid principal amount of the Tranche 2 Notes bears interest at an annual rate of 0.55% plus LIBOR in effect from time to time, adjusted quarterly, and payable quarterly in arrears beginning July 2, 2007. The principal amount of the Notes is due at maturity on April 2, 2017, subject to acceleration upon an event of default as described below. Effective as of April 2, 2007, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. which has the effect of converting the floating rate of the Tranche 2 Notes into the equivalent of a fixed rate of 5.60% per annum over the term of the Tranche 2 Notes. The Note Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default that include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods) nonpayment of principal, interest or make-whole amounts, breach of covenants or other agreements in the Note Purchase Agreement and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Generally, if an event of a default occurs, the holder may accelerate payment of the Notes. The Notes will accelerate automatically if certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency occur. The obligations of the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company pursuant to a Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement dated as of April 2, 2007 by such subsidiaries in favor of the purchaser of the Notes. The Note Purchase Agreement, including the forms of the Tranche 1 Notes and the Tranche 2 Notes, is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Form 8-K; the Subsidiary Guaranty Agreement by the Company's subsidiaries in favor of the purchaser of the Notes is filed as Exhibit 10.2 to this Form 8-K.

The Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Notes and the Series 2007-A Tranche 2 Notes shall be substantially in the forms set out in Exhibit 1(a) and Exhibit 1(b), respectively, with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by the Purchasers and the Company.

Section 1.3 Provisions Relating to the Series 2007-A Tranche 2 Notes. (a) The Series 2007-A Tranche 2 Notes shall bear interest (computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and, as to each Interest Period or other period during which interest accrues, from and including the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof) on the unpaid principal thereof from the date of issuance at a floating rate equal to the Applicable Floating Rate for the Interest Period in effect from time to time, payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, interest on any overdue payment of interest, on any overdue payment (including any overdue prepayment) of principal and on any overdue payment of Prepayment Premium and on any overdue payment of Breakage Amount at the Default Rate, until such overdue amounts shall have been paid.

Any such offer shall provide each holder of the Notes of the Series being offered for purchase with sufficient information to enable it to make an informed decision with respect to such offer and shall remain open for at least 10 Business Days.

In the event of a sale, lease or other disposition of a "substantial part" of the assets of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary where the Company has elected to apply the net proceeds of such sale, lease or other disposition pursuant to Section 10.5(b), the Company shall, no later than the 305th day following the date of such sale, lease or other disposition, give written notice of such event (a "Sale of Assets Prepayment Event") to each holder of Notes. Such notice shall contain, and shall constitute, an irrevocable offer to prepay a Ratable Portion of the Notes held by such holder on the date specified in such notice (the "Sale of Assets Prepayment Date") which date shall be not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days after such notice. (b) Acceptance and Payment. A holder of Notes may accept or reject the offer to prepay pursuant to this Section 8.6 by causing a notice of such acceptance or rejection to be delivered to the Company at least 10 days prior to the Sale of Assets Prepayment Date. A failure by a holder of the Notes to respond to an offer to prepay made pursuant to this Section 8.6 shall be deemed to constitute an acceptance of such offer by such holder. If so accepted, such offered prepayment in respect of the Ratable Portion of the Notes of each holder that has accepted such offer shall be due and payable on the Sale of Assets Prepayment Date. Such offered prepayment shall be made at 100% of the aggregate Ratable Portion of the Notes of each holder that has accepted such offer, together with interest on that portion of the Notes then being prepaid accrued to the Sale of Assets Prepayment Date and, if applicable, the Breakage Amount, if any, with respect to the principal being prepaid but, in any case, without any Make-Whole Amount or Prepayment Premium. (c) Officer's Certificate.

Section 8.7 Make-Whole Amount for the Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Notes. The term "Make-Whole Amount" shall mean, with respect to any Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note, minus the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings: -24-
"Called Principal" shall mean, with respect to any Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note, the principal of such Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires. "Discounted Value" shall mean, with respect to the Called Principal of any Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. "Reinvestment Yield" shall mean, with respect to the Called Principal of any Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note, 0.50% plus the yield to maturity calculated by using (a) the yields reported, as of 10:00 a.m. (New York, New York time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as "Page PX1" (or such other display as may replace Page PX1 on Bloomberg Financial Markets ("Bloomberg") or, if Page PX1 (or its successor screen on Bloomberg) is unavailable, the Telerate Access Service screen which corresponds most closely to Page PX1) for the most recently issued actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date, or (b) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), the Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. In either case, the yield will be determined, if necessary, by (1) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (2) interpolating linearly on a straight line basis between (i) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (ii) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of such Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Notes. "Remaining Average Life" shall mean, with respect to the Called Principal of any Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by dividing (a) such Called Principal into (b) the sum of the products obtained by multiplying (1) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by (2) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment. -25-
"Remaining Scheduled Payments" shall mean, with respect to the Called Principal of any Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of such Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 12.1. "Settlement Date" shall mean, with respect to the Called Principal of any Series 2007-A Tranche 1 Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires. SECTION 9. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. The Company covenants that so long as any of the Notes are outstanding: Section 9.1 Compliance with Law.

Section 9.2 Insurance. The Company will, and will cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to their respective properties and businesses against such casualties and contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such amounts (including deductibles, co-insurance and self-insurance, if adequate reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is customary in the case of entities of established reputations engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated.

The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, file all tax returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges or levies imposed upon them or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes, assessments, governmental charges or levies have become due and payable and before they have become delinquent and all claims for which sums have become due and payable that have or might become a Lien on properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary, provided that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax, assessment, governmental charge, levy or claim if (a) the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by the Company or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings, and the Company or a Subsidiary has established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of the Company or such Subsidiary or (b) the non-filing or nonpayment, as the case may be, of all such taxes, assessments, governmental charges, levies and claims in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 9.5 Corporate Existence, Etc. Subject to Section 10.4, the Company will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence. Subject to Sections 10.4 and 10.5, the Company will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect the corporate or other existence of each of its Restricted Subsidiaries (unless merged into the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) and all rights and franchises of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries unless, in the good faith judgment of the Company, the termination of or failure to preserve and keep in full force and effect such corporate or other existence, right or franchise would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 9.6 Notes and Subsidiary Guaranty to Rank Pari Passu. (a) The Notes and all other obligations under this Agreement of the Company are and at all times shall remain direct and unsecured obligations of the Company ranking pari passu as against the assets of the Company with all other Notes from time to time issued and outstanding hereunder without any preference among themselves and pari passu with all other present and future unsecured Senior Debt (actual or contingent) of the Company. (b) The Subsidiary Guaranty and all other obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guaranty are and at all times shall remain direct and unsecured obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor ranking pari passu as against the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor with all other present and future unsecured Senior Debt (actual or contingent) of such Subsidiary Guarantor.

The Company may from time to time cause any Subsidiary (other than a Subsidiary Guarantor) to be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be designated a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that at the time of such designation and immediately after giving effect thereto, (a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing under the terms of this Agreement and (b) the Company and its Subsidiaries or Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, would be in compliance with all of the covenants set forth in this Section 9 and Section 10 if tested on the date of such action and provided, further, that, except as required in order for the Company to comply with the requirements of Section 10.9, once a Subsidiary has been designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to this Section 9.8, it shall not thereafter be redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or a Restricted Subsidiary on more than one occasion. Within 10 days following any designation described above, the Company will deliver to each holder of Notes a notice of such designation accompanied by a certificate signed by a Senior Financial Officer of the Company certifying compliance with all requirements of this Section 9.8 and setting forth all information required in order to establish such compliance.

The Company will cause any Subsidiary which becomes an obligor, co-obligor or guarantor in respect of Debt under the Bank Credit Agreement to become a party to the Subsidiary Guaranty and deliver to each of the holders of the Notes (concurrently with becoming an obligor, co-obligor or guarantor in respect of Debt under the Bank Credit Agreement) the following items: (a) a supplement to the Subsidiary Guaranty in the form of Exhibit A to the Subsidiary Guaranty (a "Guaranty Supplement"); (b) a certificate signed by an authorized Responsible Officer making representations and warranties to the effect of those contained in Sections 5.2, 5.4, 5.6 and 5.7, with respect to such Subsidiary and such Subsidiary Guaranty, as applicable; and (c) an opinion of counsel (who may be in-house counsel for the Company) addressed to each of the holders of the Notes which opinion shall be satisfactory to the Required Holders, to the effect that the Guaranty Supplement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and that such Subsidiary Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid and binding contract and agreement of such Subsidiary enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as an enforcement of such terms may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles. Anything in this Section 9.9 to the contrary notwithstanding, a Foreign Subsidiary that is or becomes a borrower under the Bank Credit Agreement shall not be deemed to be an obligor, guarantor or co-obligor of obligations existing under the Bank Credit Agreement for purposes of this Section 9.9 if such Subsidiary shall have no obligations under the Bank Credit Agreement or any other agreement or instrument for the repayment of any Debt outstanding under the Bank Credit Agreement (whether upon default by any party to the Bank Credit Agreement or otherwise) other than Debt directly borrowed by such Subsidiary. -28-

In this Section 10.1, for purposes of calculating Consolidated EBITDA for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, if during such period (1) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary shall have acquired or disposed of any Person or acquired or disposed of all or substantially all of the assets of any Person or any business unit or division of any Person or (2) any Restricted Subsidiary is designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary, Consolidated EBITDA for such period shall be calculated after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such transaction occurred on the first day of such period.

(b) Supplements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company may enter into any Supplement providing for the issuance of one or more Series of Additional Notes consistent with Section 2.2 hereof without obtaining the consent of any holder of any other Series of Notes. Section 17.2 Solicitation of Holders of Notes. (a) Solicitation. The Company will provide each holder of the Notes (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof, of any Supplement, of the Subsidiary Guaranty or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes. (b) Payment. The Company will not, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security or provide other credit support, to any holder of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof, of any Supplement, of the Subsidiary Guaranty or of any Note unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted or other credit support is concurrently provided, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.

Section 17.3 Binding Effect, Etc.

No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Company and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder, under the Subsidiary Guaranty or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note.

This Section 19 shall not prohibit the Company or any other holder of Notes from contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction. SECTION 20. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. For the purposes of this Section 20, "Confidential Information" shall mean information delivered to any Purchaser or any Additional Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by such Purchaser or Additional Purchaser as being confidential information of the Company or such Subsidiary, provided that such term does not include information that (a) was publicly known or otherwise known to such Purchaser or such Additional Purchaser prior to the time of such disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by such Purchaser or such Additional Purchaser or any Person acting on such Purchaser's or such Additional Purchaser's behalf, (c) otherwise becomes known to such Purchaser or such Additional Purchaser other than through disclosure by the Company or any Subsidiary or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to such Purchaser or such Additional Purchaser under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available.

Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or any Supplement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of this Section 20. SECTION 21. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER. Each Purchaser and each Additional Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one of its Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that it has agreed to purchase hereunder or under a Supplement, by written notice to the Company, which notice shall be signed by both such Purchaser or such Additional Purchaser and such Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement or such Supplement, as the case may be, and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt of such notice, any reference to such Purchaser or such Additional Purchaser in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21) or such Supplement, shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu of such original Purchaser or such original Additional Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a Purchaser or an Additional Purchaser hereunder or under a Supplement and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to such original Purchaser or such original Additional Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, any reference to such Affiliate as a "Purchaser" or an "Additional Purchaser" in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21) or such Supplement, shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to such original Purchaser or such original Additional Purchaser, and such original Purchaser or such original Additional Purchaser shall again have all the rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement or such Supplement, as the case may be. SECTION 22. MISCELLANEOUS. Section 22.1 Successors and Assigns. All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement (including all covenants and other agreements contained in any Supplement) by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not. -44-
Section 22.2 Payments Due on Non-Business Days. Anything in this Agreement, any Supplement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding (but without limiting the requirement in Section 8.4 that the notice of any optional prepayment specify a Business Day as the date fixed for such prepayment), any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount, if any, or Prepayment Premium, if any, and Breakage Amount, if any, or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day; provided that if the maturity date of any Note is a date other than a Business Day, the payment otherwise due on such maturity date shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.

Section 22.5 Construction. Each covenant contained herein or in any Supplement shall be construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained herein or therein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein or in any Supplement refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person. For the avoidance of doubt, all Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement or any Supplement shall be deemed to be a part hereof or of such Supplement. Section 22.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto. Section 22.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would permit the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State. -45-
Section 22.8 Jurisdiction and Process; Waiver of Jury Trial. (a) The Company irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Supplement or the Notes. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (b) The Company consents to process being served by or on behalf of any holder of Notes in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 22.8(a) by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to it at its address specified in Section 18(4) or at such other address of which such holder shall then have been notified pursuant to said Section. The Company agrees that such service upon receipt (1) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (2) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. Notices hereunder shall be conclusively presumed received as evidenced by a delivery receipt furnished by the United States Postal Service or any reputable commercial delivery service. (c) Nothing in this Section 22.8 shall affect the right of any holder of a Note to serve process in any manner permitted by law, or limit any right that the holders of any of the Notes may have to bring proceedings against the Company in the courts of any appropriate jurisdiction or to enforce in any lawful manner a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other jurisdiction.

(11) the failure to execute a Guaranty Accession Agreement in connection with the issuance of any Series of Additional Notes; or (12) any merger or consolidation of the Company, any Guarantor or any other Person into or with any other Person or any sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of any of the assets of the Company, any Guarantor or any other Person to any other Person, or any change in the ownership of any shares or other equity interests of the Company, any Guarantor or any other Person; or (13) any defense whatsoever that: (i) the Company or any other Person might have to the payment of the Notes (including, principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, Prepayment Premium, if any, Breakage Amount, if any, or interest), other than payment thereof in federal or other immediately available funds or (ii) the Company or any other Person might have to the performance or observance of any of the provisions of the Notes, the Note Purchase Agreement, any Supplement or any other agreement, whether through the satisfaction or purported satisfaction by the Company or any other Person of its debts due to any cause such as bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, merger, consolidation, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or otherwise; or (14) any act or failure to act with regard to the Notes, the Note Purchase Agreement, any Supplement, this Guaranty or any other agreement or anything which might vary the risk of any Guarantor or any other Person; or (15) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Guarantor or any other Person in respect of the obligations of any Guarantor or other Person under this Guaranty or any other agreement; provided that the specific enumeration of the above-mentioned acts, failures or omissions shall not be deemed to exclude any other acts, failures or omissions, though not specifically mentioned above, it being the purpose and intent of this Guaranty and the parties hereto that the obligations of each Guarantor shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be discharged, impaired or varied except by the payment of the principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if any, Prepayment Premium, if any, Breakage Amount, if any, and interest on the Notes in accordance with their respective terms whenever the same shall become due and payable as in the Notes provided, at the place specified in and all in the manner and with the effect provided in the Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement, as each may be amended or modified from time to time. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that repeated and successive demands may be made and recoveries may be had hereunder as and when, from time to time, the Company shall default under or in respect of the terms of the Notes or the Note Purchase Agreement and that notwithstanding recovery hereunder for or in respect of any given default or defaults by the Company under the Notes or the Note Purchase Agreement or any Supplement, this Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and shall apply to each and every subsequent default. (d) All rights of any Holder under this Guaranty shall be considered to be transferred or assigned at any time or from time to time upon the transfer of any Note held by such Holder whether with or without the consent of or notice to the Guarantors under this Guaranty or to the Company. -7-
(e) To the extent of any payments made under this Guaranty, the Guarantors shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holder or Holders upon whose Notes such payment was made, but each Guarantor covenants and agrees that such right of subrogation and any and all claims of such Guarantor against the Company, any endorser or other Guarantor or against any of their respective properties shall be junior and subordinate in right of payment to the prior indefeasible final payment in cash in full of all of the Notes and satisfaction by the Company of its obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement and each Supplement and by the Guarantors of their obligations under this Guaranty, and the Guarantors shall not take any action to enforce such right of subrogation, and the Guarantors shall not accept any payment in respect of such right of subrogation, until all of the Notes and all amounts payable by the Guarantors hereunder have indefeasibly been finally paid in cash in full and all of the obligations of the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement and each Supplement and of the Guarantors under this Guaranty have been satisfied. Notwithstanding any right of any Guarantor to ask, demand, sue for, take or receive any payment from the Company, all rights, Liens and security interests of each Guarantor, whether now or hereafter arising and howsoever existing, in any assets of the Company shall be and hereby are subordinated to the rights, if any, of the Holders in those assets. No Guarantor shall have any right to possession of any such asset or to foreclose upon any such asset, whether by judicial action or otherwise, unless and until all of the Notes and the obligations of the Company under the Note Purchase Agreement shall have been paid in cash in full and satisfied. (f) Each Guarantor agrees that to the extent the Company or any other Person makes any payment on any Note, which payment or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, voided, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered, rescinded or is required to be retained by or repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other Person under any bankruptcy code, common law, or equitable cause, then and to the extent of such payment, the obligation or the part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect with respect to the Guarantors' obligations hereunder, as if said payment had not been made. The liability of the Guarantors hereunder shall not be reduced or discharged, in whole or in part, by any payment to any Holder from any source that is thereafter paid, returned or refunded in whole or in part by reason of the assertion of a claim of any kind relating thereto, including, but not limited to, any claim for breach of contract, breach of warranty, preference, illegality, invalidity or fraud asserted by any account debtor or by any other Person. (g) No Holder shall be under any obligation: (1) to marshal any assets in favor of the Guarantors or in payment of any or all of the liabilities of the Company under or in respect of the Notes and the Note Purchase Agreement and each Supplement or the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder or (2) to pursue any other remedy that the Guarantors may or may not be able to pursue themselves and that may lighten the Guarantors' burden, any right to which each Guarantor hereby expressly waives. (h) If an event permitting the acceleration of the maturity of the principal amount of the Notes shall at any time have occurred and be continuing and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented or the right of any Holder to receive any payment under any Note shall at such time be delayed or otherwise affected by reason of the pendency against the Company of a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or insolvency law, each Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this Guaranty and its obligations hereunder, the maturity of such principal amount shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if the Holders had accelerated the same in accordance with the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement (including any Supplement), and such Guarantor shall forthwith pay such accelerated principal of, Make-Whole Amount, if any, Prepayment Premium, if any, Breakage Amount, if any, and interest on the Notes and any other amounts guaranteed hereunder. -8-
SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor represents and warrants to each Holder that: (a) Such Guarantor is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on (1) the business, operations, affairs, financial condition, assets or properties of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (2) the ability of the Guarantors, taken as a whole, to perform their obligations under this Guaranty or (3) the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty (herein in this Section 5, a "Material Adverse Effect"). Such Guarantor has the corporate or other power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Guaranty and to perform the provisions hereof. (b) Each Subsidiary of such Guarantor is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of such Guarantor has the corporate or other power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact. (c) This Guaranty has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Guarantor, and this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (1) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (2) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). (d) The execution, delivery and performance by such Guarantor of this Guaranty will not (1) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any property of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, organizational document or any other agreement or instrument to which such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or by which such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties may be bound or affected, (2) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries or (3) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries. -9-

(f) (1) There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of such Guarantor, threatened against or affecting such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries (that are Restricted Subsidiaries) property of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries (that are Restricted Subsidiaries) court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(h) Such Guarantor is solvent, has capital not unreasonably small in relation to its business or any contemplated or undertaken transaction and has assets having a value both at fair valuation and at present fair salable value greater than the amount required to pay its debts as they become due and greater than the amount that will be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts as they become absolute and matured.

Such Guarantor will not be rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of, and performance of its obligations under, this Guaranty.

SECTION 6. AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS. (a) This Guaranty may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof may be waived (either retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of each Guarantor and the Required Holders, except that (1) no amendment or waiver of any of the provisions of Sections 3, 4 or 5, or any defined term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to any Holder unless consented to by such Holder in writing, and (2) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written consent of each Holder, (i) change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the Holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment or waiver or (ii) amend Section 2 or this Section 6. No consent of the Holders or the Guarantors shall be required in connection with the execution and delivery of a Guaranty Supplement or other addition of any additional Guarantor, and each Guarantor, by its execution and delivery of this Guaranty (or Guaranty Supplement) consents to the addition of each additional Guarantor. No consent of the Holders or the Guarantors shall be required in connection with the issuance and sale of Additional Notes, and each Guarantor, by its execution and delivery of this Guaranty (or Guaranty Supplement) consents to the issuance of Additional Notes pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement. (b) The Guarantors will provide each Holder (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to enable such Holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions hereof. The Guarantors will deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6 to each Holder promptly following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the requisite Holders.

(c) No Guarantor will directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any Holder as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by such Holder of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each Holder even if such Holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment. (d) Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 6 applies equally to all Holders affected thereby and is binding upon them and upon each future holder and upon the Guarantors. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant or agreement not expressly amended or waived or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Guarantors and any Holder nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any Holder. As used herein, the term "this Guaranty" and references thereto shall mean this Guaranty as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented. (e) Solely for the purpose of determining whether the Holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Guaranty, Notes directly or indirectly owned by any Guarantor, the Company or any of their Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding. -11-

Notices under this Section 7 will be deemed given only when actually received. SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS. (a) No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to any Holder is intended to be exclusive of any other available remedy or remedies, but each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given under this Guaranty now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. No delay or omission to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default, omission or failure of performance hereunder shall impair any such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver thereof but any such right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. In order to entitle any Holder to exercise any remedy reserved to it under this Guaranty, it shall not be necessary for such Holder to physically produce its Note in any proceedings instituted by it or to give any notice, other than such notice as may be herein expressly required. (b) The Guarantors will pay all sums becoming due under this Guaranty by the method and at the address specified for such purpose for such Holder, in the case of a Holder that is a 2007-A Note Purchaser, on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreement, and in the case of a Holder that is an Additional Purchaser, on Schedule A to the corresponding Supplement or by such other method or at such other address as any Holder shall have from time to time specified to the Guarantors or the Company on behalf of the Guarantors in writing for such purpose, without the presentation or surrender of this Guaranty or any Note. -12-

(d) If the whole or any part of this Guaranty shall be now or hereafter become unenforceable against any one or more of the Guarantors for any reason whatsoever or if it is not executed by any one or more of the Guarantors, this Guaranty shall nevertheless be and remain fully binding upon and enforceable against each other Guarantor as if it had been made and delivered only by such other Guarantors. (e) This Guaranty shall be binding upon each Guarantor and its successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of each Holder and its successors and assigns so long as its Notes remain outstanding and unpaid. If any Guarantor enters into any consolidation or merger, pursuant to which such Guarantor is not the surviving entity (the "Successor Corporation"), the Successor Corporation shall execute and deliver to each Holder its assumption of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition of this Guaranty (pursuant to such agreements and instruments as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders). (f) This Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto. (g) This Guaranty shall be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such State that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than such State. (h) Each Guarantor irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each Guarantor irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. (i) Each Guarantor consents to process being served by or on behalf of any Holder in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in Section 8(h) by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to it at its address specified in Section 7 or at such other address of which such Holder shall then have been notified pursuant to said Section. Each Guarantor agrees that such service upon receipt (1) shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or proceeding and (2) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it. Notices hereunder shall be conclusively presumed received as evidenced by a delivery receipt furnished by the United States Postal Service or any reputable commercial delivery service. -13-
(j) Nothing in Section 8(h) or 8(i) shall affect the right of any Holder to serve process in any manner permitted by law, or limit any right that the Holders may have to bring proceedings against any Guarantor in the courts of any appropriate jurisdiction or to enforce in any lawful manner a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other jurisdiction. (k) EACH GUARANTOR HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT ON OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS GUARANTY OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH. -14-

For further information, contact: Gary L. Castagna Senior Vice President & CFO 847.394.8730 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE:ACO) REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 13 PERCENT ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL., APRIL 20, 2007--AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2007 first quarter net income of $10.8 million or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with $9.7 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. Net sales rose 15% percent to $163.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2007, compared with $142.8 million for the 2006 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $12.6 million and $4.5 million, respectively, of the first-quarter sales growth. Operating profit improved by 22 percent over the 2006 period to $14.7 million. Current-period operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $2.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the Financial Overview. "With overall earnings per share up 13 percent and sales up 15 percent, we had what would typically be characterized as a good first quarter in 2007," said Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. "We saw an encouraging improvement in margins in our Minerals segment despite the soft U.S. metalcasting business. And, although the Environmental segment's first-quarter results were good, they were affected by difficult weather in the United States. MORE
AMCOL Q1 2007 EARNINGS Page 2 of 8 "We don't anticipate significant improvement in our metalcasting business, but we do expect continued positive results in our Environmental segment moving into the second and third quarters, which are typically stronger quarters for that segment." At the same time, Washow says, "Results in our Oilfield Services segment were disappointing, and despite the increase in overall sales, our profitability didn't reflect the growth we would have expected. Our sales increase was due in large part to recent strategic acquisitions, which also were associated with additional overhead costs. We anticipate stronger performance in coming quarters as our volumes continue to grow again in part on the strength of the acquisitions." Washow adds, "The decline in revenue and profitability in the Transportation segment reflects a softness in the economy as well as some of our domestic businesses. Lastly, with a higher level of debt, interest expense has an effect on the bottom line." FINANCIAL OVERVIEW First Quarter Operating Results The following table details the consolidated sales growth components over the 2006 first quarter: The Minerals segment's base business sales declined due to a slowdown in the domestic metalcasting operations. The other Minerals segment product lines - specialty minerals and pet products - saw higher base business sales. Environmental base business sales grew primarily due to higher shipments in Europe and Asia. Oilfield Services experienced a slowdown in its well testing and filtration services operations late in the quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 26.6 percent compared with 25.0 percent in the prior-year first quarter. The Minerals, Environmental and Oilfield Services segments improved gross margin over the 2006 period. Favorable product mix and geographical sales distribution primarily accounted for the improvement. Transportation showed a slight decline over the prior-year period. MORE
AMCOL Q1 2007 EARNINGS Page 3 of 8 General, selling and administrative expenses were $28.8 million in the 2007 first quarter, an increase of $5.1 million or 22 percent over the 2006 period. The Oilfield Services segment accounted for approximately one-half of the increase as it incurred higher personnel costs and amortization expense associated with acquisitions completed in 2006. Operating expenses at the recently acquired Liquid Boot business, higher personnel costs in Europe and foreign currency translation led to the increase in the Environmental segment. Operating margin for the quarter was 9.0 percent compared with 8.4 percent in the prior-year period. The improvement was principally due to the higher gross margin reported in the current period. Net interest expense increased by approximately $1.5 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels and increased interest rates. The Company's effective tax rate was 26.3 percent for the first quarter of 2007 versus 28.9 percent for the same period in 2006. The 2006 quarter included additional expense for adjustments related to previously recorded tax liabilities. Income from affiliates and joint ventures contributed approximately $0.05 and $0.04 per diluted share in the 2007 and 2006 reporting periods, respectively. The Company's India-based investments contributed most of the earnings. The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares was 31.0 million and 30.9 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Financial Position Long-term debt increased to $155.6 million at March 31, 2007 compared to $112.4 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to funding acquisitions, greater working capital levels and capital expenditures. Debt represented 34 percent of total capitalization at March 31, 2007, compared with 28 percent at December 31, 2006. Cash and cash equivalents were $23.8 million at March 31, 2007 compared with $17.8 million at December 31, 2006. Working capital increased to $195.8 million at March 31, 2007 from $173.3 million at December 31, 2006. The current ratio was 3.7-to-1 and 3.2-to-1 at March 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006, respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $6.3 million year-to-date as of March 31, 2007 compared with cash used in operating activities of $4.1million in the prior-year period. MORE
AMCOL Q1 2007 EARNINGS Page 4 of 8 Investing activities in the 2007 quarter included two acquisitions - Liquid Boot Technologies, included in the Environmental segment, and the Microsponge(R) business of Cardinal Health Care Company, included in the Minerals segment. The acquisitions and payments associated with previous transactions totaled $27.2 million through the first quarter of the year. Capital expenditures amounted to $10.9 million year-to-date as of March 31, 2007, compared with $9.3 million for the same period in 2006. Expenditures related to Minerals segment projects accounted for the increase over the prior-year period. There were no share repurchases during the first quarter of the year. Dividends declared year-to-date through March 31, 2007, increased by 28% over the prior-year period to $4.2 million.

Castagna Senior Vice President & CFO 847.394.8730 AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE:ACO) REPORTS 26% INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OVER PRIOR-YEAR SECOND QUARTER ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL., JULY 20, 2007-AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2007 second-quarter income from continuing operations of $15.3 million or $0.49 per diluted share, compared with $11.9 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. A $0.3 million loss from discontinued operations, or $0.01 per diluted share, was reported in the second quarter of 2007 for the sale of a desiccant business based in the U.K. Net income was $15.0 million, or $0.48 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2007. Net sales from continuing operations rose 19.4 percent to $182.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, compared with $152.7 million for the 2006 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $15.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively, of the second-quarter sales growth. Operating profit improved by 29.1 percent over the 2006 period to $19.1 million. Current-period operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $3.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively. "We saw solid earnings and sales growth overall in the second quarter," says Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer. "The strength of our acquisitions began to show as they started delivering the value we expected in both the Environmental and Oilfield Services businesses." "Additionally, our Environmental business did very well on its own, with organic business in that division continuing to expand. Oilfield Services demonstrated a rebound after a softer first quarter, with good sales and profit growth. MORE
AMCOL Q2 2007 EARNINGS Page 2 of 10 "One area in which we're focusing attention is Minerals, where gross profits were up but gross margins were down this quarter. We attribute that to a combination of product mix and cost issues that we're working on. However, AMCOL earnings were up more than sales and it was a good quarter for us." For the six-month period ended June 30, 2007, income from continuing operations was $26.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, compared with $21.6 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2007, was $25.8 million, or $0.83 per diluted share compared with $21.6 million; or $0.70 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Net sales from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2007, rose 17.0 percent to $346.2 million, compared with $295.5 million for the 2006 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $27.9 million and $8.6 million, respectively, of the sales growth. Operating profit improved by 25.9 percent over the 2006 period to $33.8 million. Current-period operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $5.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the Financial Overview. FINANCIAL OVERVIEW Second Quarter Statement of Operations Highlights Net sales: The following table details the consolidated sales growth components over the 2006 second quarter: Base Foreign Business Acquisitions Exchange Total Minerals (0.1)% 4.0% 1.1% 5.0% Environmental 4.5% 2.1% 1.5% 8.1% Oilfield Services 1.6% 4.1% 0.1% 5.8% Transportation 0.5% - - 0.5% Total 6.5% 10.2% 2.7% 19.4% % of Growth 33.7% 52.6% 13.7% 100% MORE
AMCOL Q2 2007 EARNINGS Page 3 of 10 Minerals - Base business sales declined over the 2006 quarter entirely due to lower shipments to domestic metalcasting markets. Asia-Pacific metalcasting operations continued to grow. The specialty minerals and pet product lines realized higher base business sales. Acquisitions continued to meet expectations, while stronger European and Asian currencies led to the growth from foreign exchange. Environmental - Base business sales grew primarily due to higher shipments of lining technology and building material products in the U.S and Europe. Contracting service revenues also contributed to the growth over the 2006 quarter. The Liquid Boot acquisition completed in January of this year posted sales in-line with expectations. Stronger European currencies accounted for foreign exchange growth. Oilfield Services - Base business growth was led by higher well testing and pipeline service revenues primarily generated in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. International business, principally in the North Sea and West Africa, was relatively unchanged compared with the prior-year quarter. The two businesses acquired in the second half of 2006, Unique Rentals and Nitrogen Specialties, have both met revenue expectations. Gross profit: Sales growth, principally generated by the Environmental and Oilfield Services segments, boosted gross profit by 25.4 percent over the 2006 quarter. Gross margin for the quarter rose to 27.3 percent compared with 26.0 percent in the prior-year quarter. The Minerals segment suffered a 90 basis point decline in gross margin compared with the 2006 quarter. Higher manufacturing costs in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific operations caused the gross margin decline. The Environmental segment improved gross margin over the 2006 period due to favorable product mix and higher relative sales in the European markets. Additionally, the acquired business contributed higher gross margins. The Oilfield Services segment benefited from higher relative profitability contributed by acquired businesses. Additionally, margins improved in the base business operations due to more favorable product/service mix. General, selling and administrative expenses: The $5.8 million, or 23.3 percent, increase over the 2006 second quarter was primarily attributed to general, selling and administration, (GS&A) for acquired businesses. In aggregate, acquired businesses, including amortization of intangible assets, accounted for approximately $3.0 million of the increase in the 2007 second quarter. Within the Minerals segment, acquired business expenses were approximately $0.6 million of the increase over the prior-year quarter. Base business GS&A grew in the Asia Pacific region due to marketing and start-up costs at the Tianjin, China and Queensland, Australia operations. MORE
AMCOL Q2 2007 EARNINGS Page 4 of 10 Acquired businesses accounted for approximately $1.0 million of the increase over the prior-year quarter within the Environmental segment. Base business GS&A increased primarily due to higher marketing and sales expenses at the European operations. The Oilfield Services segment incurred approximately $1.4 million of GS&A from acquired businesses. Base business expenses increased due to higher personnel costs. Corporate segment GS&A increased due to higher personnel and professional service expenses. Operating profit: The 29.1 percent improvement in operating profit over the 2006 second quarter was in-line with sales and gross profit growth. Operating margin for the quarter was 10.5 percent compared with 9.7 percent in the prior-year period. The improvement was principally due to the higher gross margin reported in the current period. Interest expense: Net interest expense increased by approximately $1.5 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels and increased interest rates. Income taxes: The effective tax rate was 24.7 percent for the second quarter of 2007 compared with 26.6 percent for the same period in 2006. The decline in the tax rate reflects updated estimates of taxable income distribution between domestic and overseas businesses. Income from affiliates and joint ventures: These investments contributed approximately $0.08 and $0.04 per diluted share in the 2007 and 2006 reporting periods, respectively. Our investments in Ashapura Minechem Limited and Ashapura Volclay Limited, both based in India, have continued to increase their respective contributions to earnings. Ashapura Minechem has been growing principally due to its bauxite business, a large portion of which is exported to alumina refineries in China. Alumina is a key raw material used in the production of aluminum. Share count: The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares remained unchanged at 30.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2007 compared with the same period in 2006. Key Financial Position points Long-term debt increased to $168.2 million at June 30, 2007 compared with $112.4 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to funding acquisitions, greater working capital levels and capital expenditures. Debt represented approximately 35 percent of total capitalization at June 30, 2007, compared with 28 percent at December 31, 2006. Cash and cash equivalents were $25.2 million at June 30, 2007 compared with $17.8 million at December 31, 2006. MORE
AMCOL Q2 2007 EARNINGS Page 5 of 10 Working capital increased to $201.2 million at June 30, 2007 from $173.3 million at December 31, 2006. The current ratio was 3.3-to-1 and 3.2-to-1 at June 30, 2007, and December 31, 2006, respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities was $25.6 million year-to-date as of June 30, 2007 compared with $5.7 million in the six-month period in 2006. In addition to the growth in net income, the 2007 period was aided by higher non-cash charges and lower relative growth in working capital. Investing activities in the 2007 six-month period were primarily driven by three acquisitions which, in aggregate, accounted for $38.4 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $21.9 million year-to-date as of June 30, 2007, compared with $20.5 million for the same period in 2006. Approximately $6.1 million was expended on share repurchases in 2007 year-to-date. A total of 250,000 shares were repurchased, which equates to approximately $24.34 per share. Dividends declared year-to-date through June 30, 2007, increased by 22% over the prior-year period to $8.4 million.

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL., OCTOBER 19, 2007
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2007 third-quarter income from continuing operations of $20.1 million or $0.65 per diluted share, compared with $16.0 million or $0.52 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. Earnings in both reporting periods benefited from non-recurring events. A gain on the sale of vacant land in the U.S. added $0.06 per diluted share to the 2007 third quarter. Income from continuing operations in the 2006 third quarter included a $0.09 per diluted share net benefit resulting from income tax refunds.
Net sales from continuing operations rose 27.2 percent to $203.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007, compared with $160.2 million for the 2006 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $15.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of the third-quarter sales growth.
Operating profit improved by 58.5 percent over the 2006 period to $26.0 million. Current-period operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $1.9 million and $0.7 million, respectively. The previously mentioned gain on sale of assets also contributed $2.4 million to operating profit.
Overall, this was a very good quarter for us, says Larry Washow, AMCOL president and chief executive officer.
 
Excluding the impact of the vacant land sale, over 60% of our operating profit growth resulted from organic growth. We continue to show solid year-over-year improvement.
Environmental usually posts its strongest performance in the third quarter, and this year was no exception. In the United States, growth was strong in the contracting services business, and there was improvement across all the business lines in Europe.
AMCOL Q3 2007 EARNINGS

Oilfield Services, too, experienced continued strong growth in the third quarter, Washow continued. Acquisitions added to performance there, but the basic business has been very solid.
As always, though, there are some ongoing challenges. Minerals continues to feel the effects of a soft metalcasting market in the United States. And while we showed growth in Minerals in Asia, the cost of bringing new operations online had an effect. As a result, although Minerals had good sales growth during the quarter, the margins there werent where we want them to be.
Were continuing to address the challenges and working to maintain our performance in all areas. As these results demonstrate, were showing continued growth and added value for our shareholders.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, income from continuing operations was $46.2 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, compared with $37.7 million, or $1.22 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007, was $46.0 million, or $1.48 per diluted share compared with $38.2 million; or $1.24 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Earnings in both reporting periods benefited from non-recurring events. A gain on the sale of vacant land in the U.S. added $0.06 per diluted share to the 2007 period. Income from continuing operations in the 2006 period included a $0.09 per diluted share net benefit resulting from income tax refunds. Discontinued operations accounted for a loss of $0.01 per diluted share in the 2007 period compared with a gain of $0.02 per diluted share in the 2006 period.
Net sales from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 rose 20.7 percent to $549.8 million, compared with $455.6 million for the 2006 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $43.6 million and $13.7 million, respectively, of the sales growth. Operating profit improved by 38.2 percent over the 2006 period to $59.8 million. Current-period operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $7.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the Financial Overview.
 
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
Third Quarter Statement of Operations Highlights
Net sales:
The following table details the consolidated sales growth components over the 2006 third quarter:
 
 
AMCOL Q3 2007 EARNINGS
Page 3 of 11
 
 
 
Minerals - Base business improved over the 2006 quarter primarily due to export shipments from the U.S., as well as increased shipments and pricing in pet products and greater shipments in the Asia-Pacific region. Specialty materials sales were relatively unchanged compared with the prior-year period. Stronger European and Asian currencies led to the growth from foreign exchange.
Environmental - Growth in contracting services (based in the U.S.) and greater lining technologies and building materials shipments in Europe contributed to the base business growth over the 2006 quarter. Stronger European currencies accounted for foreign exchange growth.
Oilfield Services - Base business growth was led by increased filtration and pipeline service levels in the Gulf of Mexico. International markets, principally in the North Sea and West Africa, also improved over the prior-year quarter.
 
Gross profit:
Sales growth, principally generated by the Environmental and Oilfield Services segments, boosted gross profit by 28.6 percent over the 2006 quarter. Gross margin for the quarter rose to 26.7 percent compared with 26.4 percent in the prior-year quarter.
The Minerals segment suffered a 90 basis point decline in gross margin compared with the 2006 quarter. Higher freight revenues in the current-year quarter caused the gross margin decline.
Higher relative contribution from contracting services caused the 30 basis point decline in the Environmental segment gross margin compared with the prior-year period.
The Oilfield Services segment benefited from higher relative profitability contributed by the acquired businesses. Additionally, margins improved in the base business operations due to more favorable product/service mix.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
The $2.5 million, or 9.6 percent, increase over the 2006 third quarter includes the benefit of a gain on the sale of vacant land, which was described earlier in this release. Excluding this benefit, GS&A would have increased by $4.9 million, or 18.8 percent, over the prior-year quarter. In aggregate, acquired businesses, including amortization of intangible assets, accounted for approximately $3.3 million of the increase in the 2007 third quarter.
 
AMCOL Q3 2007 EARNINGS
Page 4 of 11
Within the Minerals segment, acquired business expenses were approximately $1.0 million of the increase over the prior-year quarter. Base business GS&A grew in the Asia Pacific region due to higher marketing expenses and start-up costs at the Tianjin, China facility.
A benefit from a gain on the sale of vacant land reduced Environmental segment GS&A by $2.4 million in the current-year quarter. Acquired businesses accounted for approximately $0.8 million of the increase over the prior-year quarter within the Environmental segment. Base business GS&A increased primarily due to higher marketing and sales expenses at the European operations.
The Oilfield Services segment incurred approximately $1.4 million of GS&A from acquired businesses. Base business expenses increased due to higher personnel costs.
Corporate segment GS&A declined principally due to professional service expenses incurred in the 2006 third quarter related to the income tax refunds described below.
Operating profit:
The 58.5 percent improvement in operating profit over the 2006 third quarter was primarily related to sales and gross profit growth. Operating margin for the quarter was 12.8 percent compared with 10.2 percent in the prior-year period. The improvement was principally due to the higher gross margin reported in the current period and the benefit from the gain on sale of vacant land. Excluding this benefit, operating profit would have grown by 44.0 percent and operating margin would have been 11.6 percent in the 2007 third quarter.
Interest expense:
Net interest expense increased by approximately $1.7 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels and increased interest rates.
Income taxes:
The effective tax rate was 20.7 percent for the third quarter of 2007 compared with 8.0 percent for the same period in 2006. Favorable adjustments to contingency reserves reduced the effective tax rate in the 2007 quarter. These adjustments benefited income by approximately $1.0 million. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate would have been 24.9 percent in this years quarter. Favorable tax reductions of approximately $3.4 million related to amended income tax returns caused the low tax rate in the 2006 quarter.
Income from affiliates and joint ventures:
These investments contributed approximately $0.07 and $0.06 per diluted share in the 2007 and 2006 reporting periods, respectively. Our investments in Ashapura Minechem Limited and Ashapura Volclay Limited, both based in India, have continued to increase their respective contributions to earnings. Ashapura Minechem has been growing principally due to its bauxite business, a large portion of which is exported to alumina refineries in China. Alumina is a key raw material used in the production of aluminum.

Share count:
The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares remained relatively unchanged at 30.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 compared with 30.8 million in the same period in 2006.
 
Key Financial Position and Cash Flow Highlights
Long-term debt increased to $164.2 million at September 30, 2007 compared with $112.5 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to funding acquisitions, greater working capital levels and capital expenditures. Debt represented approximately 33 percent of total capitalization at September 30, 2007, compared with 28 percent at December 31, 2006. Cash and cash equivalents were $20.8 million at September 30, 2007 compared with $17.8 million at December 31, 2006.
Working capital increased to $202.0 million at September 30, 2007 from $173.3 million at December 31, 2006. The current ratio was 3.0-to-1 and 3.2-to-1 at September 30, 2007, and December 31, 2006, respectively.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $42.0 million year-to-date as of September 30, 2007 compared with $28.9 million in the nine-month period in 2006. In addition to the growth in net income, the 2007 period was aided by higher non-cash charges and lower relative growth in working capital.
Investing activities in the 2007 nine-month period were primarily driven by three acquisitions which, in aggregate, accounted for $38.8 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $37.6 million year-to-date as of September 30, 2007, compared with $30.0 million for the same period in 2006.
Approximately $6.1 million was expended on share repurchases year-to-date, as of September 30, 2007. A total of 250,000 shares were repurchased, which equates to $24.34 per share. There were no share repurchases in the third quarter. Dividends declared year-to-date through September 30, 2007, increased by 26 percent over the prior-year period to $13.2 million.

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL, JANUARY 18, 2008
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2007 fourth-quarter net income of $10.8 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, compared with $12.0 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in the same prior-year period. A higher effective tax rate in the 2007 quarter caused a $0.08 per diluted share decrease in net income from the prior-year period.
Net sales from continuing operations rose 24.8 percent to $194.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2007, compared with $155.9 million for the 2006 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $12.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of the fourth-quarter sales growth.
Operating profit improved by 9.8 percent over the 2006 quarterly period, to $15.5 million. Current-period operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $1.4 million and $0.6 million, respectively.
Overall, this quarter reflected very strong sales growth, particularly in Environmental and Oilfield Services, said Larry Washow, AMCOL president and CEO. We also saw improved operating profit, although not at the same level as our sales growth. The quarter also showed good operating cash flow and working capital management.
The Companys Minerals segment margins remained a challenge in the fourth quarter, Washow says, but the Environmental and Oilfield Services segments performed very well.
Costs were higher in the Minerals business, which impacted gross margin, he said. We also had higher overhead, primarily related to acquisitions and new operations, with lower operating profit quarter over quarter as a result. We expect improvement in several areas in coming months.
On the bright side, Environmental had a very good quarter. The fourth quarter is usually softer for that business, but this one was very strong around the world. Oilfield Services was very strong, as well, with significant sales and operating profit growth.

Washow notes that AMCOL corporate overhead also increased during the fourth quarter, due to a number of factors such as consulting and employee benefit related costs.
Some of these expenditures dont directly relate to our operations today, but theyll be beneficial to the company overall, he said. We consistently evaluate and implement improvements that we believe will help us expand our market share worldwide, improve efficiency and increase shareholder returns.
Net income for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2007, was $56.7 million, or $1.83 per diluted share compared with $50.2 million, or $1.62 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Income from continuing operations was $57.0 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared with $49.7 million, or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Earnings in both reporting periods benefited from non-recurring events. A gain on the sale of vacant land in the U.S. added $0.06 per diluted share to the 2007 period. Income from continuing operations in the 2006 period included a $0.09 per diluted share net benefit resulting from income tax refunds. Discontinued operations accounted for a loss of $0.01 per diluted share in the 2007 period compared with a gain of $0.02 per diluted share in the 2006 period.
Net sales from continuing operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2007 rose 21.7 percent to $744.3 million, compared with $611.6 million for the 2006 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $38.5 million and $18.5 million, respectively, of the sales growth.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
Fourth Quarter Statement of Operations Highlights
Net sales:
The following table details the consolidated sales growth components over the 2006 fourth quarter:
 
 
 
 
AMCOL Q4 2007 EARNINGS
Page 3 of 11
 
Minerals - Improved metalcasting shipments in the Asia-Pacific region were the largest contributor to base business growth. Additional contributors to base business growth were the pet products and specialty materials product lines. Freight revenues, which were primarily associated with pet products, also increased sales in the period. Stronger European and Asian currencies led to the growth from foreign exchange.
Environmental - Growth in Europe, in particular from the Poland-based operations, and contracting services (based in the U.S.) were the primary contributors to base business growth. Stronger European currencies accounted for foreign exchange growth.
Oilfield Services - Base business growth was led by increased filtration and pipeline service levels in the Gulf of Mexico. West Africa operations also generated improved revenues over the prior-year quarter.
Gross profit:
Sales growth, principally generated by the Environmental and Oilfield Services segments, boosted gross profit by 17.0 percent over the 2006 quarter. Gross margin for the quarter declined to 25.1 percent compared with 26.8 percent in the prior-year quarter.
The Minerals segment suffered a 260 basis point decline in gross margin compared with the 2006 quarter. Higher mining and operating costs at the domestic manufacturing plants primarily caused the decline. Additionally, gross margin was impacted by unfavorable product mix in Europe and higher freight revenues, which do not generate any profit.
A change in product mix at the European business unit and higher relative contribution from contracting services caused the 260 basis point decline in the Environmental segment gross margin compared with the prior-year period. The European businesses had a higher level of service revenues for product installation. These services typically have lower gross margins than actual product sales.
Gross margin for the Oilfield Services segment suffered a 70 basis point decline in the current-year quarter. Again, business mix was the cause.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
The $5.7 million, or 20.6 percent, increase over the 2006 fourth quarter was attributed to all reporting segments except for Transportation. In aggregate, acquired businesses, including amortization of intangible assets, accounted for approximately $2.0 million of the increase in the 2007 fourth quarter.
 
 
 
 
AMCOL Q4 2007 EARNINGS
Page 4 of 11
 
 
Within the Minerals segment, acquired business expenses were approximately $0.9 million of the increase over the prior-year quarter. Base business GS&A grew in the Asia Pacific region due to higher sales and marketing expenses.
For the Environmental segment, GS&A from acquired businesses accounted for approximately $0.9 million of the increase over the prior-year quarter. Base business GS&A increased primarily due to higher marketing and sales expenses at the European operations.
The Oilfield Services segment incurred approximately $0.2 million of GS&A from acquired businesses. Base business expenses increased due to higher personnel costs.
Corporate segment GS&A increased due to a group of expenses including employee benefits and professional and consulting service expenses.
 
Operating profit:
The 9.8 percent improvement in operating profit over the 2006 fourth quarter was primarily related to sales and gross profit growth. Operating margin for the quarter was 8.0 percent compared with 9.0 percent in the prior-year period. The 100 basis point decline was principally due to the lower gross margin reported in the current period.
Interest expense:
Net interest expense increased by approximately $1.3 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels and increased interest rates.
Income taxes:
The effective tax rate was 34.3 percent for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared with 14.8 percent for the same period in 2006. The current-year quarter was negatively impacted primarily by changes in geographical earnings distribution estimates. Our effective tax rate for international businesses is much lower than the U.S. Higher than forecasted earnings growth from U.S.-based operations - primarily in the Oilfield Services segment - required us to increase estimated income tax liabilities for 2007. Since this is the last quarter of the year, the change in estimate increased the effective rate by a large amount. Favorable tax reductions in the 2006 period due to changes in deduction and credit estimates caused the low rate in 2006.
Income from affiliates and joint ventures:
These investments contributed approximately $0.07 and $0.03 per diluted share in the 2007 and 2006 fourth quarter periods, respectively. Our investments in Ashapura Minechem Limited and Ashapura Volclay Limited, both based in India, have continued to increase their respective contributions to earnings. Ashapura Minechem has been growing principally due to its bauxite business, a large portion of which is exported to alumina refineries in China. Alumina is a key raw material used in the production of aluminum.

Share count:
The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares was 31.0 million for both reporting periods.
 
 
Key Financial Position and Cash Flow Highlights
Long-term debt increased to $164.2 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $112.4 million at December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily due to funding acquisitions, greater working capital levels and capital expenditures. Debt represented approximately 31.8 percent of total capitalization at December 31, 2007, compared with 27.6 percent at December 31, 2006. Cash and cash equivalents were $25.3 million at December 31, 2007 compared with $17.8 million at December 31, 2006.
Working capital increased to $204.0 million at December 31, 2007 from $173.3 million at December 31, 2006. The current ratio was 3.0-to-1 and 3.2-to-1 at December 31, 2007, and December 31, 2006, respectively.
Cash flow provided by operating activities was $66.9 million year-to-date as of December 31, 2007 compared with $46.7 million in the twelve-month period in 2006. In addition to the growth in net income, the 2007 period was aided by higher non-cash charges and lower relative growth in working capital.
Investing activities in the 2007 twelve-month period were primarily driven by three acquisitions which, in aggregate, accounted for $40.1 million. Capital expenditures amounted to $53.1 million year-to-date as of December 31, 2007, compared with $42.1 million for the same period in 2006. The 2007 amount includes expenditures to construct new corporate offices that we intend to refinance through a sale-leaseback transaction in the first quarter of 2008.
Approximately $6.4 million was expended on share repurchases year-to-date, as of December 31, 2007. A total of 260,000 shares were repurchased, which equates to $24.64 per share. Dividends year-to-date through December 31, 2007, increased by 22.7 percent over the prior-year period to $18.0 million.
This release contains certain forward-looking statements regarding AMCOLs expected performance for future periods and actual results for such periods might materially differ. Such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties, which include, but are not limited to, actual growth in AMCOLs various markets, utilization of AMCOLs plants, currency exchange rates, currency devaluation, delays in development, production and marketing of new products, integration of acquired businesses, and other factors detailed from time to time in AMCOLs annual report and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AMCOL undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in AMCOLs expectations.

Other Events
On March 5, 2008, AMCOL International Corporation (the Company) issued a press release announcing that it has executed a definitive agreement to acquire the majority ownership interest in a chrome mine located in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The agreement is subject to various conditions, including approval by the shareholders of the seller, Chrome Corporation Limited, a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange, and by RSA regulators. Upon the closing of this transaction, the Company will hold 74% of the ownership interest in the chrome mine and Aka Capital, a Black Economic Empowerment Enterprise, will hold the remaining 26% of the ownership interest. Separately, AMCOL is in discussions with another RSA-based firm to co-invest in the chrome mine, processing operations and downstream marketing. AMCOL anticipates it will retain control of the business.

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL, March 5, 2008
 AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) today announced that it has executed a definitive agreement to acquire an interest in a chrome mine in the Republic of South Africa (RSA).  Chrome ore is a feedstock used to produce chrome sand. AMCOL currently markets chrome sand to the metalcasting industry in the U.S.  AMCOL will purchase the 74% interest in the chrome mine from Chrome Corporation Limited (ASX CCI), a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange. Aka Capital, a Black Economic Empowerment Enterprise, owns the remaining 26% interest in the chrome mine. Separately, AMCOL is in discussions with an RSA-based firm to co-invest in the chrome mine, processing operations and downstream marketing. AMCOL anticipates it will retain control of the business. 
 
AMCOL will pay
 
A$41 million cash for the interest in the chrome mine, less assumed liabilities at closing. The closing of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including the following: the approval of the sellers shareholders; consent under Section 11(1) of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act from the South African Minister for Minerals and Energy; confirmation of the existing prospecting rights or the grant of a renewal of the prospecting rights; approval from the RSA Exchange Control Authorities; unconditional approval from RSA Competition Authorities; and consent from AMCOLs bank syndicate.
 
Larry Washow, AMCOL President and CEO commented We have been a leading marketer of chrome sand in the U.S. for over 30 years.  This investment will allow AMCOL to be the premier dedicated chrome sand supplier to foundries around the world.  We are fortunate to have an attractive investment opportunity in a key product line that offers significant growth potential.
 
Estimates indicate that approximately 90% of the 20 million tons of chrome ore mined annually is used to produce ferrochrome.  The surge in demand for stainless steel has considerably tightened ferrochrome supply which has caused a drop in supply available for foundry chrome.  AMCOL plans to invest in a processing plant near the mine site after closing of the transaction.   
 
Headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois, AMCOL has five reporting segments: Minerals, Environmental, Oilfield Services, Transportation and Corporate.  The Minerals segment produces and markets specialty minerals and related materials used as a performance additive in industrial goods and consumer products.  The Environmental segment manufactures and markets engineered materials used in, and provides related services for, construction, waste containment and civil infrastructure applications.  The Oilfield Services segment provides this industry with water treatment and related services.  AMCOLs common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ACO.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2.):
 
The information in this item is being furnished to, but not filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission solely under Item 12 of Form 8-K, Results of Operations and Financial Condition, pursuant to interim procedures promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Release 33-8216 issued March 27, 2003.
On April 18, 2008, the registrant issued a press release to report results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2008.
That press release dated, April 18, 2008 and titled 
AMCOL International (NYSE:ACO) Reports First-Quarter Earnings
 is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 

 
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL., APRIL 18, 2008
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2008 first-quarter net income of $8.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share, compared with $10.8 million or $0.35 per diluted share in the same prior-year period.
Net sales rose 16.9% to $191.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, compared with $163.7 million for the 2007 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $5.9 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of the first-quarter sales growth. Operating profit declined by 13.5% over the 2007 period to $12.7 million. Acquisitions added less than $0.1 million to current-period operating profit while foreign currency translation contributed $0.5 million.
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included in the Statement of Operations Highlights.
Sales were up across all segments in the first quarter, and Oilfield Services had operating profit growth of 24.7%, says Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. At the same time, however, we experienced a number of issues that dampened our overall performance. Increased energy costs were a significant factor this quarter. Overhead was up due to costs from acquisitions, greater R&D expenditures and higher benefits cost.
 
AMCOL Q1 2008 EARNINGS
Page 2 of 10
Despite solid sales growth of 15.8% in the Minerals segment, quarter-over-quarter operating profits were down 17.0% from a year ago, primarily because of higher energy costs. Operating margins were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, but we expect to see improvement in margins in the quarters ahead, Washow continues.
Sales in the Environmental segment were up 19.6% quarter-over-quarter but operating profit decreased slightly by 4.4%, he says. Weather, energy costs, overhead and product mix all played a role, but, again, our expectations for the balance of the year are positive.
In summary, Washow says, Were seeing the effects of a number of economic influences, but we are continuing to identify opportunities to improve costs. Given the strength of the energy sector, we expect continued strong performance in Oilfield Services, and the outlook is promising for other segments over the rest of the year, as well.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
Net sales:
The following table details the consolidated sales growth components over the 2007 first quarter:
Minerals:
Approximately one-third of the base business growth was attributed to freight pass-through revenue. Higher shipments in the pet products division led to the increase in freight revenue and contributed to base business volume growth over the 2007 quarter. Base business sales were also aided by higher demand in the Asia-Pacific metalcasting market and certain specialty materials product lines. Pricing was increased in certain product lines and geographical markets; however, higher relative contribution of lower-priced products - mix - lowered sales compared with 2007.
Sales from acquisitions were principally contributed by the Turkish operations followed by a Mexican joint venture business. Foreign exchange benefit resulted from British Pound and Asia-Pacific currency translation.
2
 
AMCOL Q1 2008 EARNINGS
Page 3 of 10
Environmental:
A 19.6% improvement in sales was primarily generated from the Poland-based operations. Base business growth in building materials division shipments and installation services led to the increase. Additionally, higher shipments of lining technology product lines in the U.S. market contributed to the increase.
Oilfield Services:
Demand for water treatment services in the Gulf of Mexico was the largest contributor to base business growth. Additional sales improvement came from emerging geographic markets.
Transportation:
Traffic levels increased over the prior-year quarter due to higher demand from consumer products shippers.
Gross profit:
Sales growth provided the increase in gross profit; however, gross margin was 24.2% which was a 240 basis point decline from the 2007 quarter.
Minerals:
The decline from the prior-year first quarter was primarily attributed to rising energy, production and mining costs in the U.S. Additionally, gross margin was impacted by unfavorable product mix in Europe and higher freight revenues, which do not generate any profit.
Environmental:
Within the Environmental segment, gross margin declined by 260 basis points due to sales of lower profit products and services relative to the prior-year quarter. In addition, rising production costs in the U.S.-based operations negatively impacted current-period gross margin.
Oilfield:
Oilfield Services gross margin was comparable to the prior-year quarter.
Transportation:
The transportation segment suffered a decline of 90 basis points. Under-recovered fuel surcharges were the principal reason for the negative gross margin comparison.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
The $4.8 million, or 16.8%, increase over the 2007 first quarter was principally caused by the Minerals, Environmental and Corporate segments. Acquired businesses added $1.0 million of GS&A to the current-year quarter.
Minerals:
Acquired business expenses were $0.8 million. Base business GS&A grew due to higher research and development expenditures for the specialty materials division and personnel costs in the Asia-Pacific region.
Environmental:
GS&A increased primarily due to higher compensation and sales commission expenses at the Poland-based operations.
Corporate:
GS&A increased from higher health and welfare benefit expenses.

AMCOL Q1 2008 EARNINGS
Page 4 of 10
Operating profit:
The decline from the prior-year quarter was primarily caused by the combined effect of relatively low gross profit improvement and higher GS&A costs. Consequently, operating margin declined by 240 basis points.
 
Interest expense:
Net interest expense increased by approximately $0.5 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels.
Income taxes:
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2008 was 27.0% compared with 26.3% for the same period in 2007. Lower tax credits were recorded in the current-year quarter. No research and experimentation credit was recorded since legislation allowing this credit lapsed at the end of 2007.
Income from affiliates and joint ventures:
Lower profits from our India-based investments accounted for the $0.3 million decline from the prior-year quarter. Delay of large bauxite shipments caused the reduction in earnings.
Share count:
Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were 30.9 million and 31.0 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
Funded long-term debt increased to $188.1 million at March 31, 2008 compared to $164.2 million at December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to funding higher working capital levels and capital expenditures incurred in the first quarter. Total long-term debt represented 35.5% of capitalization at March 31, 2008, compared with 31.8% at December 31, 2007. Cash and cash equivalents were $33.2 million at March 31, 2008 compared with $25.3 million at December 31, 2007.
As mentioned in our Form 10-K for 2007, during the first quarter, we completed a sale-leaseback transaction pursuant to which we sold land to a third-party and agreed to lease a new corporate headquarters facility on the site. The building is currently under construction and we expect to occupy the building by the end of 2008.  Pursuant to the transaction, the owner will fund
 anticipated
construction costs related to the building, including reimbursing us for expenditures we incurred prior to the transaction. We will account for the building expenditures as a construction in progress asset during the construction period with an offsetting amount recorded as long-term financing debt.  In the quarter during which we take occupancy of the building, we will record a sale of the land and building equal to the total construction costs and land value. 
Working capital increased to $233.1 million at March 31, 2008 from $202.5 million at December 31, 2007. The current ratio was 3.5-to-1 and 3.0-to-1 at March 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively.

AMCOL Q1 2008 EARNINGS
Page 5 of 10
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $4.3 million year-to-date as of March 31, 2008 compared to $6.3 million in the prior-year period. The decrease in net income and changes in working capital caused the decline in operating cash flows compared with the prior-year quarter.
Excluding the corporate building, capital expenditures were the primary investing activity in the 2008 period amounting to $12.9 million compared with $10.9 million in the prior-year period. Expenditures related to Minerals and Oilfield Services segment projects accounted for the increase over the prior-year period.
Approximately $2.0 million has been expended on share repurchases as of March 31, 2008. Eighty-thousand shares were repurchased in the first quarter of 2008 at an average price of $25.45 per share. Dividends declared year-to-date through March 31, 2008, increased by 14.6% over the prior-year period to $4.8 million.

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL., JULY 18, 2008
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2008 second-quarter income from continuing operations of $17.9 million or $0.58 per diluted share, compared with $15.3 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the same prior-year period.
Net sales from continuing operations rose 28.2% to $233.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2008, compared with $182.5 million for the 2007 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $8.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively, of the second-quarter sales growth. Operating profit increased by 22.5% over the 2007 period to $23.5 million. Acquisitions added $1.4 million to current-period operating profit while foreign currency translation contributed $0.8 million.
For the six-month period ended June 30, 2008, income from continuing operations was $26.5 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, compared with $26.1 million, or $0.84 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Net income for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008, was $26.5 million, or $0.86 per diluted share compared with $25.8 million, or $0.83 per diluted share in the prior-year period, reflective of a $0.01 charge for discontinued operations that occurred during the second quarter of 2007.
Net sales from continuing operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2008, rose 22.8 % to $425.3 million, compared with $346.2 million for the 2007 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $14.6 million and $9.6 million, respectively, of the sales growth.

This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included later in this press release.
We had strong revenue growth across all of our reporting segments this quarter says Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. Operating profit grew as well, particularly in Oilfield Services and Environmental. However, it was another quarter where we saw significant energy price increases impacting our margins.
In spite of the ongoing cost issues, the Minerals segment did deliver gross and operating margin improvement compared to the first quarter of 2008. Washow continued, We are not at all satisfied with the results, but even with the difficult operating environment we are seeing a positive trend that we expect will continue.
Also compared to last quarter, the Environmental segment experienced strong growth due to the seasonal nature of its business, Washow stated.
Oilfield Services benefited from the strong market conditions as well as a mid-quarter acquisition, which is already a positive contributor. Second quarter results show overall sales growth of 63.5%, generating a 77.7% operating profit improvement, Washow added.
Costs are an ongoing issue as we saw overhead spending increase primarily due to benefits and IT costs, plus additional expenses related to acquisitions. We have also increased our R&D spending, Washow concluded.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
Net sales:
The following details the consolidated sales growth components over the 2007 second quarter:
 
Minerals
: Freight pass-through revenue accounted for approximately one-fourth of the base business growth, principally from the pet products and metal castings divisions. Base business sales were driven by demand in the Asia-Pacific metal casting market and certain specialty materials product lines, notably from customers in South Africa and China, in addition to price increases in U.S. metal castings and basic materials divisions.
 
Sales from acquisitions were contributed by our operations in Turkey and Mexico.
 
AMCOL Q2 2008 EARNINGS
Page 3 of 12
Environmental
: Base business growth in building materials division shipments and installation services in Western Europe and Poland as well as higher shipments in lining technology product lines in the U.S. market contributed to the increase in the quarter.
Oilfield Services:
Demand for domestic water treatment services in the Gulf of Mexico was the largest contributor to base business growth. Emerging markets in West Africa and Malaysia represented approximately 28.6% of the revenue growth. The Premium Reeled Tubing (PRT) acquisition added $3.5 million of revenue in the quarter.
Transportation:
Traffic levels increased over the prior-year quarter due to higher demand from consumer products shippers.
Gross profit:
Sales growth provided the increase in gross profit; however, gross margin was 26.8%, a 50 basis point decline from the 2007 quarter.
Minerals:
The gross margin decline is primarily attributed to rising energy costs and increases in production and mining costs, principally in the U.S., where pricing initiatives reduced the impact of these cost increases on gross margin.
Environmental
: Gross margin was comparable to the prior-year quarter.
 
Oilfield Services:
Gross margin improved 110 basis points over the prior quarter due to improved pricing, product mix, emerging markets growth and the acquisition of PRT.
Transportation:
Gross margin declined 120 basis points principally due to unrecovered fuel surcharges.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
GSA expenses increased $8.6 million, a 27.9% increase over the 2007 second quarter. Expenses in each segment increased, with Oilfield Services experiencing the largest increase due to overall growth of the business, entering emerging markets and the acquisition of PRT.
Minerals:
Base business GS&A grew due to increased research and development expenditures for the specialty materials division and personnel costs in the Asia-Pacific region.
Environmental
: GS&A increased primarily due to increased compensation and sales commission expenses at the Poland-based operations.
Corporate:
GS&A increased $2.1 million due to increasing benefits costs and IT expenses resulting from infrastructure investments.
AMCOL Q2 2008 EARNINGS
Page 4 of 12
 
Operating profit:
The increase over the prior-year quarter was primarily caused by the combined effect of the gross profit improvement somewhat offset by increases in GS&A costs, especially in our Corporate segment, which drove the 50 basis points decrease in operating margin.
Interest expense:
Net interest expense increased by approximately $0.7 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels.
Other, net:
The increases represents a currency hedge gain on a position in the Australian dollar for our pending South Africa chrome mine investment, offset by other foreign currency fluctuations and minority interest.
Income taxes:
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2008 was 26.8% compared with 24.7% for the same period in 2007. This is due to increased operating profit in the U.S., which has higher tax rates than international operations.
Income from joint ventures:
Income from our India based investments remained relatively consistent versus prior periods.
Share count:
Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were 31.0 million and 30.9 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
Long-term debt increased to $249.5 million at June 30, 2008 compared to $164.2 million at December 31, 2007.  The increase was primarily due to funding acquisitions, increased working capital levels and capital expenditures.
 
Total long-term debt represented 40.6% of capitalization at June 30, 2008, compared with 31.8% at December 31, 2007.  Cash and cash equivalents were $22.0 million at June 30, 2008 compared with $25.3 million at December 31, 2007.
Working capital increased to $250.3 million at June 30, 2008 from $202.5 million at December 31, 2007.  The current ratio was 3.1-to-1 and 3.0-to-1 at June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively.
Cash flow used in operating activities was $2.0 million year-to-date as of June 30, 2008 compared to $25.6 million cash being generated in the prior-year period.  The increase in working capital caused the decline in operating cash flows compared with the prior-year period, principally due to a greater increase in accounts receivable of $24.7 million.
AMCOL Q2 2008 EARNINGS

Excluding the corporate building, acquisitions were the primary investing activity in the 2008 period amounting to $42.3 million, largely due to the PRT acquisition compared with $38.4 million in the prior-year period.  Capital expenditures in the 2008 period amounted to $23.3 million compared with $21.0 million in the prior-year period.
Approximately $2.0 million has been expended on share repurchases thru June 30, 2008, with $6.6 million remaining under authorization.  Eighty thousand shares were repurchased at an average price of $25.45 per share.  Dividends declared year-to-date through June 30, 2008, increased by 15.2 % over the prior-year period to $9.7 million.

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL., OCTOBER 17, 2008
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2008 third-quarter income from continuing operations of $18.6 million or $0.60 per diluted share, compared with $20.1 million or $0.65 per diluted share in the same prior-year period. Operating profit in the 2007 quarter benefited from a $2.4 million gain on the sales of vacant land in the U.S., or $.06 per diluted share. Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico negatively impacted 2008 third quarter earnings by an estimated $.03 per diluted share.
Net sales from continuing operations rose 24.3% to $253.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2008, compared with $203.6 million for the 2007 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $9.1 million and $3.2 million, respectively, of the third-quarter sales growth. Operating profit increased by 5.2% over the 2007 period to $27.4 million. Acquisitions and foreign currency translation each contributed $0.7 million to current-period operating profit.
For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, income from continuing operations was $45.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted share, compared with $46.2 million, or $1.49 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, was $45.1 million, or $1.45 per diluted share compared with $46.0 million, or $1.48 per diluted share in the prior-year period, which includes a $.01 charge for discontinued operations.
Net sales from continuing operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, rose 23.4 % to $678.3 million, compared with $549.8 million for the 2007 period. Acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation represented approximately $23.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively, of the sales growth. Operating profit improved by 6.2% over the 2007 period to $63.5 million. Current-year operating profit includes earnings from acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation of $2.1 million and $2.0 million, respectively.

This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included later in this press release.
We are pleased to report another quarter of solid sales growth across the company, says Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. However we did see significant margin erosion in the Oilfield Services segment where hurricanes and product mix combined to reduce our margins.
Environmental segment gross margins were down slightly as well due to product mix but operating margins reflected the strong seasonal results, Washow added.
Minerals segment gross margins still require improvement but increased compared to the second quarter 2008 results and we did report an increase in operating margins this quarter as well. We expect continuing improvement in this segment, Washow stated.
Corporate and overhead expenses were up but at a lower rate than previous quarters. The majority of the increase is related to IT costs and increased benefits expenses, Washow concluded.
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
Net sales:
The following details the consolidated sales growth components for each operating segment over the 2007 third quarter:
 
Minerals:
Approximately one-third of the revenue increase in the Minerals segment is due to price increases, principally in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Asia-Pacific. Base business growth was driven by increased volume from our South African chrome operations, increased demand for Asia-Pacific metalcasting and specialty products and increased sales of products used in the U.S. petroleum industry.
 
Environmental
: Increased demand for lining technology product lines in the U.S. and Asian markets and installation services in Poland were the largest contributors to base business growth in the quarter.
Oilfield Services:
Base business growth was driven by both the expansion of domestic land-based well testing services and increased demand for nitrogen services in pipeline applications. The hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico impacted the demand and product mix resulting in a higher percentage of land based services in the quarter. Sales from acquisitions were from Premium Reeled Tubing (PRT).
 
 
AMCOL Q3 2008 EARNINGS

Transportation:
Traffic levels increased over the prior-year quarter due to higher demand from consumer products shippers.
Gross profit:
Sales growth provided the increase in gross profit; however, gross margin was 25.1%, a 160 basis point decline from the 2007 quarter, principally due to a decline in the Oilfield Services segment gross margins.
Minerals
: Gross margin of 17.7% declined 130 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter is primarily attributed to rising energy and raw material costs in addition to lower margins at new business initiatives in China and South Africa, offset by pricing initiatives. Gross margins improved 60 basis points over the 2008 second quarter.
Environmental
: Gross margin of 33.0% was comparable to the prior-year quarter.
 
Oilfield Services:
Gross margin of 32.8% declined 500 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. Product mix in the U.S., and the effect of two hurricanes in September in the Gulf of Mexico negatively impacted gross margins and were partially offset by improved gross margins in overseas markets. Gross margins declined from the second quarter 2008 by 900 basis points due to the impact of the hurricanes as previously described.
Transportation:
Gross margin of 10.5% was comparable to the prior-year quarter.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
GS&A expenses increased $7.9 million, a 28.0% increase over the 2007 third quarter. The 2007 third quarter includes the benefit of a $2.4 million gain on the sale of vacant land. Excluding this benefit, GS&A would have increased by $5.5 million, or 18.0%.
Environmental
: GS&A increased $3.2 million, a 31% increase over the 2007 quarter. The 2007 third quarter includes the benefit of a $2.4 million gain on the sale of vacant land, as described earlier. Excluding this benefit, GS&A would have increased by $.8 million, or 6.5%.
Oilfield Services:
GS&A increased $1.9 million over the prior-year quarter due to the PRT acquisition in the second quarter and increases in employee costs.
Corporate:
GS&A increased $1.2 million due to increasing benefit costs and IT expenses resulting from infrastructure investments.

Operating profit:
Operating profit increased $1.4 million, a 5.2% increase. Excluding the 2007 third quarter gain on the sale of vacant land, previously mentioned in the release, operating profit would have increased $3.8 million, or 15.9%.
Interest expense:
Net interest expense increased by approximately $1.0 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels.
Other, net:
Other, net increased $.9 million, principally due to foreign currency transactions, impacted by the substantial strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the current period.
Income taxes:
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2008 was 25.1% compared to 20.7% for the same period in 2007. Favorable adjustments to contingency reserves reduced the effective tax rate in both the 2008 and 2007 quarters. These adjustments benefited quarterly income by approximately $1.0 million each year. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate would have been 30.1% and 24.9% in the 2008 and 2007 third quarter, respectively, which reflects a greater percentage of income generated in our U.S. based businesses.
Income from joint ventures:
Income from our joint ventures, primarily our India-based investments, remained relatively consistent versus the prior period.
Share count:
Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were 31.1 million and 30.9 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
Long-term debt increased to $287.6 million at September 30, 2008 compared to $164.2 million at December 31, 2007.  The increase was primarily due to funding acquisitions, increased working capital levels and capital expenditures.
 
Total long-term debt represented 42.9% of capitalization at September 30, 2008, compared with 31.8% at December 31, 2007.  Cash and cash equivalents were $33.6 million at September 30, 2008 compared with $25.3 million at December 31, 2007.
Working capital increased to $280.1 million at September 30, 2008 from $202.5 million at December 31, 2007.  The current ratio was 3.3-to-1 and 3.0-to-1 at September 30, 2008, and December 31, 2007, respectively.

Page 5 of 12
Cash flow provided from operating activities was $2.6 million year-to-date as of September 30, 2008 compared to $42.0 million in cash generated in the prior-year period.  The increase in working capital caused the decline in operating cash flows compared with the prior-year period, principally due to an increase in accounts receivables and inventories.
Excluding the construction of the new corporate building, acquisitions were the primary investing activity in the 2008 nine month period amounting to $42.5 million, largely due to the PRT acquisition compared with $38.8 million in the prior-year period.  Capital expenditures in the 2008 period amounted to $29.7 million compared with $36.3 million in the prior-year period.
Approximately $2.0 million has been expended on share repurchases thru September 30, 2008, with $6.6 million remaining under the previously announced share repurchase program.  Eighty thousand shares were repurchased at an average price of $25.45 per share.  Dividends declared year-to-date through September 30, 2008, increased by 14.8% over the prior-year period to $15.1 million.

On January 29, 2009, AMCOL International Corporation (the Company) issued a press release announcing that we expect to restate our financial results reported in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30 and June 30, 2008 because we did not properly account for the fair value of derivative instruments held by Ashapura Minechem Limited, a publicly traded Indian company (Ashapura).  We hold a 21% interest in Ashapura.
 
In addition, we announced the impact of recording the fair value of these derivative instruments on our financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2008.  Please see Item 4.02 below for information regarding the restatement.  A copy of our press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
 
 
On January 26, 2009, the Companys Audit Committee, upon managements recommendation, determined that our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended September 30 and June 30, 2008 should no longer be relied upon because we did not properly account for the fair value of derivative instruments held by Ashapura.
 
Historically, Ashapura has entered into a variety of derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on its receivables and payables.  These derivative contracts primarily relate to the conversion of currencies between the United States Dollar (USD) and the Indian Rupee. Unlike Indian accounting principles, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP) require that we record the fair value of these derivative contracts in our balance sheet as of the end of each reporting period and record the changes in these fair values in our statement of operations.  In the course of preparing our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, we discovered that we have not historically included some of Ashapuras derivative contracts in the fair value calculations and have not correctly computed the fair value of their other derivative contracts.  We have reviewed the impact of this error on our previously issued financial statements and will restate our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the second and third quarters of 2008 to recognize unrealized, non-cash, fair market valuations of Ashapuras derivative contracts as of the end of each period.
 
 
The effects of the change on our results for the second and third quarters of 2008 are shown below:
 
 
 
In addition to restating the financial results reported in its Form 10-Q for each of the second and third quarters of 2008, we will amend other affected information, including managements discussion and analysis (MD&A) section in both Form 10-Qs to reflect the changes to the financial results.
We expect to file an amended Form 10-Q for each of the second and third quarters of 2008 as soon as possible.  Our management is in the process of assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting with respect to these issues.
 
Our management and the Audit Committee have discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02 with Ernst & Young LLP, the Companys independent registered public accounting firm.
 
CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:  This report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.  Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein.  Such statements include statements regarding the estimated amounts to be restated, the timing of the filing of amendments to AMCOLs Form 10-Qs for the quarters ended September 30 and June 30, 2008 and the effect of the restatements on previously reported net income in those periods.  There can be no assurance that future developments affecting the Company will be those anticipated by management.  Please refer to the risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time by AMCOL in its periodic filings with the SEC.  You are strongly urged to review all such filings for a more detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties.  AMCOL undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in AMCOLs expectations.

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) is reporting that our Audit Committee, upon the recommendation of management, has determined that our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended September 30 and June 30, 2008 should no longer be relied upon because we did not properly account for the fair value of derivative instruments held by Ashapura Minechem Limited, a publicly traded Indian company (Ashapura).  We hold a 21% interest in Ashapura and account for this investment using the equity method of accounting.  We intend to restate the financial results reported in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended September 30 and June 30, 2008.  We expect to file amended quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for these two quarters to properly reflect these instruments as soon as possible.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions:
 
 
 
Item 1.01                      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On February 2, 2009, AMCOL International Corporation (the Company) entered into employment agreements with each of the following executive officers: (1) Lawrence E. Washow, President and Chief Executive Officer; (2) Gary L. Castagna, Senior Vice President of the Company and President of Global Minerals; (3) Ryan F. McKendrick, Senior Vice President of the Company and President of Colloid Environmental Technologies Company; and (4) Donald W. Pearson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  The agreements with Messrs. Washow, Castagna and McKendrick are effective as of March 25, 2009.  The agreement with Mr. Pearson is effective immediately.  The agreements with Messrs. Washow, Castagna and McKendrick supplant their employment agreements expiring March 24, 2009, as described in the Companys Form 8-K filed on September 23, 2008.
 
The initial employment term expires in March 2011, with a rolling three-month extension (unless either party gives three months advance notice).  Each agreement provides for an initial annual base salary as follows: Mr. Washow - $650,000; Mr. Castagna - $315,000; Mr. McKendrick - $315,000; and Mr. Pearson - $235,000.  These base salaries are subject to discretionary annual increases.  Further, each agreement provides for a performance-based annual cash bonus opportunity in an amount equal to at least 100% of the executives base salary for Mr. Washow, and at least 60% of the executives base salary for Messrs. Castagna, McKendrick and Pearson.
 
If the Company terminates an executive without cause or the executive terminates his employment for good reason (as defined below) prior to a change of control of the Company (as defined below) or more than thirteen months after a change of control, the executive is entitled to receive the following: (1) accrued salary and bonus; (2) a pro-rata annual bonus; (3) base salary for twenty-four months (in the case of Mr. Washow) or for eighteen months (in the case of Messrs. Castagna, McKendrick and Pearson); and (4) continued health insurance coverage for the executive and his dependents at the Companys expense during a transition period, and thereafter at his own expense until the earlier of his eligibility for Medicare or his acceptance of another job.
 
If within thirteen months following a change of control, the Company terminates an executive without cause or the executive terminates his employment for good reason, or if in the thirteenth month following the transaction, the executive resigns for any reason, the executive is entitled to receive the following: (1) accrued salary, accrued bonus and a pro-rata annual bonus; (2) a lump sum equal to three times (in the case of Messrs. Washow, Castagna and McKendrick) or two times (in the case of Mr. Pearson) the sum of his salary and the greater of (i) 100% (in the case of Mr. Washow) or 60% (in the case of Messrs. Castagna, McKendrick and Pearson) of his salary, or (ii) the average annual bonus for the previous three years; and (3) continued health insurance coverage for the executive and his dependents at the Companys expense until the earlier of (x) three years (in the case of Messrs. Washow, Castagna and McKendrick) or two years (in the case of Mr. Pearson), or (y) the date the executive accepts another job.  Thereafter, the executive may continue the health insurance coverage at his own expense until the earlier of his eligibility for Medicare or his acceptance of another job.  In certain cases, the executives are entitled to these benefits if a change of control occurs within twelve months following their termination of employment.  If a change of control occurs, all outstanding stock options, restricted stock and other equity compensation awards become fully vested and exercisable unless otherwise required under Internal Revenue Code section 162(m).
 
 
 
 
A change of control of the Company is defined as one or more of the following, subject to certain exemptions:  (1) any person (other than certain Company affiliates) acquires 50.1% or more of the Companys common stock; (2) the incumbent directors cease to constitute at least one-half of the Companys directors; or (3) the consummation by the Company of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, or similar transaction, or sale or other disposition of 50.1% of the consolidated assets of the Company.
 
Good reason is defined, subject to notice requirements and an opportunity for the Company to remedy the condition, as the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) any material breach of the employment agreement by the Company; (2) the Companys failure to assign the employment agreement to a successor or the successors failure to expressly assume and agree to be bound by the employment agreement; or (3) the assignment to the executive of any duties inconsistent with his powers and role or a material reduction of his powers and role.
 
If the executives employment terminates due to his death or disability prior to a change of control or more than thirteen months after a change of control, the executive or his beneficiaries are entitled to the executives accrued salary and bonus and the executives pro-rata annual bonus.  If the executives employment terminates due to his death or disability within thirteen months after a change of control, the executive or his beneficiaries are entitled to receive the compensation and benefits described above with respect to termination without cause after a change of control.
 
If, at any time, the Company terminates an executive for cause or, except as described above, the executive terminates his employment without good reason, the executive is entitled to his accrued salary and bonus, but shall not be entitled to any severance pay.
 
Under the agreements, in the event that the Companys financial statements are restated, the Board of Directors will review the circumstances to determine whether the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably and the executive received more compensation than he would have received absent the restated financial statements.  If the Board determines that management failed to act reasonably and the executive received excess compensation, the Board will take action to recoup the excess compensation and the executive agrees to repay such amount.
 
The agreements also contain confidentiality, and one year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in favor of the Company.
 
Copies of the employment agreements are furnished herewith as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 

 
 
This EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the Agreement) is effective as of March 25, 2009 (the Effective Date), by and between AMCOL International Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), and Lawrence E. Washow (Executive).
 
The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein).  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executives full attention and dedication to the Company in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and that provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements that are competitive with those of other corporations. In addition, the Board believes it is necessary to provide a severance package that assures that the Company is able to attract and retain the highest quality executive talent and to ensure that the post-employment non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions are enforceable.  Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.

Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of the Company and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a work made for hire within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the Act).  If and to the extent that any such Work Product is found as a matter of law not to be a work made for hire within the meaning of the Act, Executive expressly assigns to the Company all right, title and or interest in and to the Work Product, and all copies thereof, and the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and all their proprietary rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due or rights of retention thereto on the part of Executive.
7.4
Intellectual Property
 
           To the extent applicable, pursuant to Illinois Employee Patent Act, the Company hereby notifies Executive that the preceding paragraph does not apply to any inventions for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Executives own time, unless: (i) the invention relates (a) to the Companys business, or (b) to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) the invention results from any work performed by the Executive for the Company.
(a)
 
15
 
           Executive agrees that upon disclosure of Work Product to the Company, Executive will, during his employment and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the Company execute and deliver all such documents and perform all such acts as the Company or its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection.
(b)
 
           In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executives signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to Work Product, whether because of Executives physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright and other analogous protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.
(c)
 
 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto(which the parties agree will not include any portion of payments allocated to the non-solicitation and non-compete provisions of Article VII which are classified as payments of reasonable compensation for purposes of Section 280G of the Code), then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary so that no portion of any such payment or benefit as so reduced constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment.
 
 
       .  In the event of a restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements, the Board will review the circumstances regarding the restatement and all performance-based compensation awarded to the Executive that is attributable to performance during the time periods restated.  If the Board determines that (i) the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably and (ii) the Executive received more compensation than he would have received absent the restated financial statements, then the Board will take action to recoup any such excess compensation and the Executive agrees to repay such amount.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in such event, the Executive may be required to (x) repay some or all of any bonus or other performance-based compensation received, (y) repay any gains realized on the exercise of stock options or on the open-market sale of vested shares; or (z) have his future compensation adjusted.  In the event the Executive does not agree with the Boards determination as to (A)  whether the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably or (B) the amount of the excess compensation received, the Executive may submit the matter to binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois (unless the parties agree in writing to a different location), before a single arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect. The decision and award made by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties hereto for all purposes, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Except as set forth below, the Company shall pay the costs of the arbitration, including administrative fees and the fees of the arbitrator.  Each party shall be responsible for the fees and costs of their attorneys and  the expenses of their witnesses.

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys obligations to make payments under Sections 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5, other than the obligation to pay Accrued Base Salary and Accrued Annual Bonus (the Termination Payments), are expressly conditioned upon the Executives execution of a release and waiver substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the Release), and the expiration of the revocation period.

The parties intend that the compensation and benefits to be provided under this Agreement shall be exempt from or compliant with the requirements of Code Section 409A of the Code and this Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such intent.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if payment of any amounts under this Agreement would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Code Section 409A because the timing of such payments is not delayed as provided in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, then any such payments to which Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of his Termination of Employment shall be accumulated and paid on the second business day that is six months after the date of such Termination of Employment with Company, or such earlier date upon which such payments can be paid under Code Section 409A of the Code without being subject to such additional taxes and interest.  Further, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if benefits to be made available under this Agreement would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Code Section 409A because the provision of such benefits is not delayed for the first six months following the date of Executives Termination of Employment with Company as provided in Code Section 409A(a)(2)B)(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, such benefits shall not be delayed; however, Executive shall pay to Company, at the time or times such benefits are provided, the fair market value of such benefits, and Company shall reimburse Executive for any such payments on or within ten days following the expiration of such six-month period.  Executive hereby agrees to be bound by Companys determination of its specified employees (as such term is defined in Code Section 409A) in accordance with any of the methods permitted under the regulations issued under Code Section 409A of the Code, which shall be determined annually by the Company.

The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein).  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executives full attention and dedication to the Company in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and that provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements that are competitive with those of other corporations. In addition, the Board believes it is necessary to provide a severance package that assures that the Company is able to attract and retain the highest quality executive talent and to ensure that the post-employment non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions are enforceable.  Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto(which the parties agree will not include any portion of payments allocated to the non-solicitation and non-compete provisions of Article VII which are classified as payments of reasonable compensation for purposes of Section 280G of the Code), then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary so that no portion of any such payment or benefit as so reduced constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment.
 
 
           .  In the event of a restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements, the Board will review the circumstances regarding the restatement and all performance-based compensation awarded to the Executive that is attributable to performance during the time periods restated.  If the Board determines that (i) the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably and (ii) the Executive received more compensation than he would have received absent the restated financial statements, then the Board will take action to recoup any such excess compensation and the Executive agrees to repay such amount.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in such event, the Executive may be required to (x) repay some or all of any bonus or other performance-based compensation received, (y) repay any gains realized on the exercise of stock options or on the open-market sale of vested shares; or (z) have his future compensation adjusted.  In the event the Executive does not agree with the Boards determination as to (A)  whether the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably or (B) the amount of the excess compensation received, the Executive may submit the matter to binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois (unless the parties agree in writing to a different location), before a single arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect. The decision and award made by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties hereto for all purposes, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Except as set forth below, the Company shall pay the costs of the arbitration, including administrative fees and the fees of the arbitrator.  Each party shall be responsible for the fees and costs of their attorneys and  the expenses of their witnesses.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if payment of any amounts under this Agreement would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Code Section 409A because the timing of such payments is not delayed as provided in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, then any such payments to which Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of his Termination of Employment shall be accumulated and paid on the second business day that is six months after the date of such Termination of Employment with Company, or such earlier date upon which such payments can be paid under Code Section 409A of the Code without being subject to such additional taxes and interest.

The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein).  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executives full attention and dedication to the Company in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and that provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements that are competitive with those of other corporations. In addition, the Board believes it is necessary to provide a severance package that assures that the Company is able to attract and retain the highest quality executive talent and to ensure that the post-employment non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions are enforceable.  Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.

(b)
 
           In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executives signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to Work Product, whether because of Executives physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright and other analogous protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.

           .  In the event of a restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements, the Board will review the circumstances regarding the restatement and all performance-based compensation awarded to the Executive that is attributable to performance during the time periods restated.  If the Board determines that (i) the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably and (ii) the Executive received more compensation than he would have received absent the restated financial statements, then the Board will take action to recoup any such excess compensation and the Executive agrees to repay such amount.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in such event, the Executive may be required to (x) repay some or all of any bonus or other performance-based compensation received, (y) repay any gains realized on the exercise of stock options or on the open-market sale of vested shares; or (z) have his future compensation adjusted.  In the event the Executive does not agree with the Boards determination as to (A)  whether the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably or (B) the amount of the excess compensation received, the Executive may submit the matter to binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois (unless the parties agree in writing to a different location), before a single arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect. The decision and award made by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties hereto for all purposes, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein).  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executives full attention and dedication to the Company in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and that provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements that are competitive with those of other corporations. In addition, the Board believes it is necessary to provide a severance package that assures that the Company is able to attract and retain the highest quality executive talent and to ensure that the post-employment non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions are enforceable.

           Executive agrees that he will not at any time, whether during or after the cessation of his employment, reveal or permit any other person or entity to reveal, any of the Confidential Information to any person or any entity, except, and only to the extent, as may be required in the ordinary course of performing Executives assigned duties as an Executive of the Company, and Executive agrees to keep secret, and take all necessary precautions against disclosure of, all Confidential Information and all matters entrusted to him and not to use or attempt to use any Confidential Information in any manner that may cause injury or loss, or may be calculated to cause injury or loss, whether directly or indirectly, to the Company or its customers;
(a)
 
           Executive agrees that during and after his employment he shall not remove, copy, duplicate or otherwise reproduce, use or permit to be used any notes, memoranda, reports, lists, records, drawings, sketches, specifications, software programs, data, documentation or other materials of any nature relating to any matter within the scope of the business of the Company or concerning any of its dealings or affairs except as required to perform Executives duties for the Company;
(b)
 
13
 
           Upon cessation of his employment relationship with the Company, Executive shall immediately deliver to the Company all Confidential Information and other materials relating to the Company in his possession or delivered to him by the Company, including computer programs, files, notes, records, memoranda, reports, lists, drawings, sketches, specifications, data, charts, and other documents, materials and things (Materials), whether or not containing Confidential Information, whether or not prepared by Executive, it being agreed that all Materials shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company;
(c)
 
           Without limiting the obligations of Section 7.1(c), Executive agrees that while Executive is employed by the Company prior to his Date of Termination and for a period of one year following his Date of Termination he will not, whether alone or as employee, owner, partner, officer, director, consultant, agent, executive, independent contractor, or stockholder of any firm, corporation or other commercial enterprise, directly or indirectly solicit business from: (i) any customer of the Company with which Executive had contact, participated in the contact, or about which Executive had knowledge of Confidential Information by reason of Executives employment with the Company within the one year period preceding the Date of Termination, or (ii) any current customer prospect of the Company for whom Executive directly or indirectly assisted in the preparation or submission of a proposal made by the Company to such customer prospect during the one year period preceding the Date of Termination, unless the Company acknowledges in writing its intent not to further pursue such customer prospect; provided, further, that Executive shall, however, be permitted to own securities of any public company not in excess of 5% of any class of such securities and to own stock, partnership interests or other securities of any non-public entity not in excess of 5% of any class of such securities, and such ownership shall not be considered to be in competition with the Company; and
(d)
 
           Except as may be required in the ordinary course of performing his duties as an employee of the Company, while employed prior to his Date of Termination and during the one year period immediately following the Date of Termination, Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, solicit or attempt to solicit any employee of the Company to work for any person, partnership or entity other than the Company, or engage in any activity that would cause any such employee to violate any agreement with the Company, or dissuade, or attempt to dissuade, any such employee from faithfully discharging such employees contractual and fiduciary obligations to serve the Companys interests with undivided loyalty.

         .  Without limiting the obligation imposed by Section 7.1, and to more fully protect the Confidential Information, Executive hereby agrees that while he is employed by the Company prior to the Date of Termination and for a period of one year following the Date of Termination, he will not, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world where the Company conducts business, render services to any Conflicting Organization in any capacity in which the Confidential Information of the Company would reasonably be considered to be useful to the Conflicting Organization; provided, however, that Executive may render services to a Conflicting Organization (and which has separate and distinct divisions), as long as such services are being rendered solely to a part of the business that is separate and distinct from the part of the business that renders such person or entity a Conflicting Organization.

If, at the time of enforcement of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, a court shall hold that the duration, scope, area or activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope, area or activity restrictions reasonable and enforceable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope, area or activity restrictions.
 
         .  Executive recognizes and agrees that a breach of any or all of the provisions of Sections 7.1 and 7.2 will constitute immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which damages cannot be readily calculated and for which damages are an inadequate remedy.  Accordingly, Executive acknowledges that in addition to any and all remedies at law, the Company shall be entitled, without bond, to specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the breach or threatened breach of Executives obligations under this Agreement.
7.3

         .  During the employment period, Executive shall disclose immediately to the Company all ideas, inventions and business plans that he makes, conceives, discovers or develops during the course of his employment with the Company, including any inventions, modifications, discoveries, developments, improvements, computer programs, processes, products or procedures (whether or not protectable upon application by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights) (Work Product) that: (i) relate to the business of the Company or any customer or supplier to the Company or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured, sold or otherwise provided by the Company or that may be used in relation therewith; (ii) result from tasks assigned to Executive by the Company; or (iii) result from the use of the premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the Company.  Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of the Company and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a work made for hire within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the Act).  If and to the extent that any such Work Product is found as a matter of law not to be a work made for hire within the meaning of the Act, Executive expressly assigns to the Company all right, title and or interest in and to the Work Product, and all copies thereof, and the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and all their proprietary rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due or rights of retention thereto on the part of Executive.
7.4
Intellectual Property
 
           To the extent applicable, pursuant to Illinois Employee Patent Act, the Company hereby notifies Executive that the preceding paragraph does not apply to any inventions for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Executives own time, unless: (i) the invention relates (a) to the Companys business, or (b) to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) the invention results from any work performed by the Executive for the Company.
(a)
 
15
 
           Executive agrees that upon disclosure of Work Product to the Company, Executive will, during his employment and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the Company execute and deliver all such documents and perform all such acts as the Company or its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection.
(b)
 
           In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executives signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to Work Product, whether because of Executives physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright and other analogous protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.
(c)
 
 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto(which the parties agree will not include any portion of payments allocated to the non-solicitation and non-compete provisions of Article VII which are classified as payments of reasonable compensation for purposes of Section 280G of the Code), then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary so that no portion of any such payment or benefit as so reduced constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment.
 
 
         .  In the event of a restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements, the Board will review the circumstances regarding the restatement and all performance-based compensation awarded to the Executive that is attributable to performance during the time periods restated.  If the Board determines that (i) the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably and (ii) the Executive received more compensation than he would have received absent the restated financial statements, then the Board will take action to recoup any such excess compensation and the Executive agrees to repay such amount.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in such event, the Executive may be required to (x) repay some or all of any bonus or other performance-based compensation received, (y) repay any gains realized on the exercise of stock options or on the open-market sale of vested shares; or (z) have his future compensation adjusted.  In the event the Executive does not agree with the Boards determination as to (A)  whether the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably or (B) the amount of the excess compensation received, the Executive may submit the matter to binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois (unless the parties agree in writing to a different location), before a single arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect. The decision and award made by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties hereto for all purposes, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Except as set forth below, the Company shall pay the costs of the arbitration, including administrative fees and the fees of the arbitrator.  Each party shall be responsible for the fees and costs of their attorneys and  the expenses of their witnesses.

The parties intend that the compensation and benefits to be provided under this Agreement shall be exempt from or compliant with the requirements of Code Section 409A of the Code and this Agreement shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such intent.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if payment of any amounts under this Agreement would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Code Section 409A because the timing of such payments is not delayed as provided in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, then any such payments to which Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of his Termination of Employment shall be accumulated and paid on the second business day that is six months after the date of such Termination of Employment with Company, or such earlier date upon which such payments can be paid under Code Section 409A of the Code without being subject to such additional taxes and interest.  Further, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if benefits to be made available under this Agreement would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Code Section 409A because the provision of such benefits is not delayed for the first six months following the date of Executives Termination of Employment with Company as provided in Code Section 409A(a)(2)B)(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, such benefits shall not be delayed; however, Executive shall pay to Company, at the time or times such benefits are provided, the fair market value of such benefits, and Company shall reimburse Executive for any such payments on or within ten days following the expiration of such six-month period.  Executive hereby agrees to be bound by Companys determination of its specified employees (as such term is defined in Code Section 409A) in accordance with any of the methods permitted under the regulations issued under Code Section 409A of the Code, which shall be determined annually by the Company.  The Company makes no representation or warranty and shall have no liability to Executive or any other person if any provisions of this Agreement are determined to constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A but do not satisfy an exemption from, or the conditions of, such section.

Item 1.01                      Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
On February 10, 2009, AMCOL International Corporation (the Company) entered into indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers (each, an Indemnitee).  Each indemnification agreement requires the Company to indemnify and advance litigation expenses to each Indemnitee to the fullest extent provided in Article Twelfth of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Article IX of the Companys By-Laws (discussed below).  In the event the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws are amended to enhance the rights of a current or former director or officer of the Company to indemnification or advancement of expenses, an Indemnitee is entitled to such enhanced rights.  In the event the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws are amended to decrease these rights, an Indemnitee is entitled to the same rights he was entitled to prior to such change.
 
The foregoing summary of the indemnification agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of agreement attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 10.1.
 
Item 5.03                      Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.
 
On February 10, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved amendments to Article IX of the Companys By-Laws.  These amendments were effective immediately.  Previously, Article IX of the By-Laws simply referenced the indemnification rights included in Article Twelfth of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation.  Amended Article IX of the By-Laws replaces the previous Article IX and includes provisions regarding indemnification and advancement of expenses.  These provisions are generally based on the provisions of Article Twelfth of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation.  Unlike the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Law provision regarding the advancement of litigation expenses to directors and officers prior to the final disposition of a legal proceeding is mandatory, as opposed to permissive.  The By-Law provisions also clarify and expand the breadth of certain provisions currently contained in Article Twelfth of the Certificate of Incorporation.
 
As in the Certificate of Incorporation, the amended By-Laws provide for mandatory indemnification for directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company (as well as trustees of certain benefit plans) where a lawsuit is brought against such person in connection with his position with the Company and he either acted in good faith or successfully defended such suit.
 
The By-Laws also include provisions regarding advancement of litigation expenses.  Advancement is permissive for non-officer employees, agents and trustees, and requires an undertaking from such person to repay the Company in the event that it is later determined he was ineligible for indemnification.  Directors and officers are entitled to mandatory advancement, with an undertaking and Board approval required in limited circumstances.
 
The amended By-Laws further track Article Twelfth of the Certificate of Incorporation, providing that the rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses are not exclusive of any other rights, survive termination of service and inure to the benefit of heirs.  In addition, the amended By-Laws provide that the rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred upon directors and officers are contract rights, and any amendment of the indemnification provisions in the By-Laws or Certificate of Incorporation is prospective only.
 
The foregoing summary of the By-Law amendments does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Companys By-Laws, as amended February 10, 2009, a copy of which is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 3.2 and incorporated herein by reference.

To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 60th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and rule 14a-11 thereunder (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and number of shares of the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.
 
(3)           Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of paragraph (A)(2) of this By-Law to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this By Law shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Corporation.

(B)           . Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this By-law, who shall be entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this By-Law. In the event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be), for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the stockholder's notice required by paragraph (A)(2) of this By-Law shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 90th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

Special Meetings of Stockholders
 
(C)           . (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the Chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this By-Law and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this By-Law, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be disregarded.
General
 
(2)           For purposes of this By-Law, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

                      .

One or more persons may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been appointed to act or is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by law.
Section 8.
Inspectors of Elections: Opening and Closing the Polls
 
The Chairman of the meeting shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting.
 
                      . In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolutions fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business or to any officer of agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meeting of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

                                . In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Section 9, to the Corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the Corporation shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the Corporation that the consents delivered to the Corporation in accordance with Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).

The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute, the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed.

Election of directors at all meetings of the Stockholders at which directors are elected shall be by ballot, and, subject to the rights of the holders of any class or series of preferred stock to elect directors under specified circumstances, a plurality of the votes cast thereat shall elect directors.
Section 12.
Powers of the Stockholders
 
                                . Each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period, and except where the transfer books of the corporation have been closed or a date has been fixed as a record date for the determination of its stockholders entitled to vote, no share of stock shall be voted on at any election for directors which has been transferred on the books of the corporation within twenty days next preceding such election of directors.
Section 13.
Voting Rights of Stockholders
 
                                . The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city, town or village where the meeting is to be held and which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting or, if not specified, at the place where said meeting is to be held, and the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of meeting during the whole time thereof, and subject to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

ITEM 2.02     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
The information in this item is being furnished to, but not filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission solely under Item 12 of Form 8-K, Results of Operations and Financial Condition, pursuant to interim procedures promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Release 33-8216 issued March 27, 2003.
On April 24, 2009, the registrant issued a press release to report results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
That press release dated, April 24, 2009 and titled  is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
AMCOL INTERNATIONAL (NYSE:ACO) REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
ITEM 9.01     Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d)          The following exhibit is furnished with this document:
 
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
 
 

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2009 first quarter net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders of $4.2 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared with $8.6 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL., APRIL 24, 2009
Net sales decreased 14.1% to $164.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 from $191.4 million in the 2008 period.  Acquisitions comprised $3.8 million of the 2009 first quarter sales growth and foreign currency fluctuations had a $14.7 million unfavorable impact.  Operating profit decreased by 20.0% over the 2008 period to $10.2 million.  Acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations had unfavorable impacts of $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, on current period operating profit.
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included later in this press release.
The global economic slowdown certainly had an impact on our business in the first quarter, but we are encouraged about gross margins which have generally held up in spite of lower volumes, said Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. Our efforts to improve our balance sheet are showing results with reductions in inventories, receivables and debt.
Washow continued, The Minerals segment reported a significant drop in revenue primarily due to the slowdown in the U.S. metalcasting and oil drilling markets. Lower costs and better pricing delivered gross margin improvement from Q1 2008, although margins were down from the prior quarter.
Sales in the Environmental segment were softer as commercial construction activity slowed around the world. In spite of lower volumes, gross margins were still nearly 32%.  The first quarter is always the most difficult for the Environmental segment and, although it will be a challenging year, our Lining Tech business tends to be less volatile than construction products, Washow stated.
The Oilfield Services segment had the revenue benefit of our mid-year acquisition of the coil tubing business, but most of the profitability came from our traditional filtration work. With low oil and gas prices, the demand is down and overall the business is more competitive but we continue to diversify the business through our foreign operations, Washow added.

We are experiencing a difficult year, but by reducing costs, taking advantage of our global footprint, and managing our balance sheet, we believe we are positioned well for a market rebound wherever and whenever it occurs, Washow concluded.
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the segment results schedules included in this press release.
 The following details the components of sales by segment for the 2009 first quarter compared to the prior-year's first quarter.
Net sales:
 
:  The majority of the decrease in the quarters revenue was due to lower volumes in U.S. metal casting and basic minerals product lines, partially offset by price increases.   Freight pass-through revenue accounted for approximately one-third of the base business decrease, principally from the pet products and metal castings divisions.   Foreign currency fluctuations represented approximately 35% of the decrease in revenue principally due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar.
Minerals
 
:  Foreign currency fluctuations represented 57% of the revenue decrease, primarily due to the weakening of the British pound and the Polish zloty against the U.S. dollar.   The remaining revenue decrease in base business was principally due to lower demand in the U.S. for building materials and installations by our contracting services group.
Environmental
  Demand for domestic water filtration in the Gulf of Mexico was the largest contributor to base business growth.  The Premium Reeled Tubing (PRT) acquisition added $3.8 million of revenue in the quarter.
Oilfield Services:
  Reductions in fuel-surcharge revenue represented 56% of the revenue decrease; the remaining decrease was due to reduced demand for consumer product shipments.
Transportation:
  Gross profit decreased $3.1 million, or 6.8%, over the 2008 first quarter while gross margin was 26.3%, a 210 basis point improvement from the 2008 quarter.
Gross profit:
Gross profit decreased $0.5 million, or 3.0%, over the 2008 quarter while gross margins improved 340 basis points to 20.2%. The gross margin improvement is principally due to US pricing initiatives put in place in 2008 and lower energy costs at our processing facilities, both offset by decreased volumes.
Minerals:
: Gross profit decreased $5.3 million, or 27.4%, over the 2008 quarter and gross margins decreased 150 basis points to 31.9%; the margin decrease is due to product mix as a greater concentration of sales were within our lining technologies products as opposed to our building materials products, which have a greater gross margin.
Environmental
 
 
 
AMCOL Q1 2009 EARNINGS
Page 3 of 10
  Gross profit increased $2.9 million, or 33.4%, over the 2008 quarter and gross margins improved 40 basis points to 36.4%.
Oilfield Services:
  Gross profit had a small decrease over the prior year quarter and gross margins improved 100 basis points to 11.8% due to lower energy costs.
Transportation:
 GS&A expenses decreased $0.6 million, a 1.7% decrease over the prior year quarter.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
 
   GS&A decreased $0.4 million, a 4.6% decrease over the 2008 quarter, the majority of the decline due to foreign exchange, offset by new costs in South Africa and increased bad debts in the U.S.
Minerals:
:  GS&A decreased $3.0 million, a 22.6% decrease over the 2008 quarter.  Approximately half of the reduction was due to foreign currency fluctuations with the remainder primarily due to lower personnel related costs.
Environmental
:  GS&A increased $1.9 million, a 40.7% increase over the 2008 quarter, due to costs from the PRT acquisition and higher commissions due to the increase in sales.
Oilfield Services
GS&A increased $0.9 million due to one-time costs for the Q2 and Q3 restatements in 2008 relating to our Indian investment in Ashapura Minechem Limited (Ashapura) as disclosed in our 2008 Form 10-K, and increased personnel and benefits costs.
Corporate:  
 The decrease from the prior-year quarter was due to the combined effect of the decreases in gross profit and GS&A.
Operating profit:
  Net interest expense increased by $1.0 million over the prior-year quarter due to higher average debt levels.
Interest expense:
Other, net increased $1.0 million, principally due to foreign currency transaction losses.
Other, net:  
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2009 was 28.3% compared with 27.0% for the same period in 2008. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2009 includes certain one-time tax adjustments. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate would have been approximately 25%.
Income taxes:  
 
 
 
AMCOL Q1 2009 EARNINGS
Page 4 of 10
  Income and losses from affiliates and joint ventures decreased $1.3 million compared to the prior year quarter.  This is principally due to our joint venture in India, Ashapura, which generated $1.2 million of earnings in the prior-year quarter and no earnings in the current quarter.   As disclosed in our 2008 Form 10-K, we have suspended the recognition of any further losses under the equity method of accounting because the investment in Ashapura has been written down to zero.
Income and losses from joint ventures:
  Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were comparable for the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and 2008 at 30.9 million shares.
Share count:
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
Long-term debt decreased to $253.0 million at March 31, 2009 compared to $256.8 million at December 31, 2008.  The reduction was primarily due to a decrease in working capital levels, offset by greater capital expenditures.Total long-term debt represented 43.4% of capitalization at March 31, 2009, compared with 43.8% at December 31, 2008.  Cash and cash equivalents were $32.6 million at March 31, 2009 compared with $19.4 million at December 31, 2008.
 
Working capital decreased to $239.1 million at March 31, 2009 from $262.7 million at December 31, 2008.  The reduction in working capital was due to a combination of lower volumes and greater focus on working capital management.
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $40.7 million for year-to-date March 31, 2009 compared to $4.3 million generated in the prior-year period.  This increase was principally due to the decrease in working capital, offset by the reduction in net income as compared with the prior-year period.
Excluding our corporate building and $15.1 million of expenditures for our purchase of a chrome mine in South Africa, capital expenditures in the 2009 period were $8.5 million compared with $12.9 million in the prior-year period.  The reduction in adjusted capital expenditures is due to our limiting capital expenditures to maintenance and minimal expansion projects in 2009.
Dividends declared year-to-date through March 31, 2009, increased by 14.3 % over the prior-year period to $5.5 million.

We continue to see a very challenging environment as revenues are down from last years second quarter across all of our reporting segments. The positive news is that gross margins have improved from the prior year, said Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. We are also pleased with progress on our balance sheet as we continued to reduce our debt levels, inventory and receivables.
Washow continued, Our Minerals segment has not seen any improvement in the U.S. metalcasting or oil drilling markets. We have seen more positive activity in Asia but the impact is relatively small in our overall minerals business. Our focus on costs continues, but we are well prepared should we see any opportunities develop in our markets.
Our Environmental segment is getting into their stronger season so we did see revenue up from Q1 but well off last years pace. The global decline in commercial construction has had a significant impact on our building materials business. Lining Technologies is also down but there are a number of projects, especially in Europe, that seem likely to begin this year, Washow added.
The Oilfield Services segment did show revenue softening even though we had the full quarter benefit of the Premium Reeled Tubing (PRT) acquisition.  The competitive environment is impacting margins. The uncertainty of oil prices and reduced drilling activity is also reducing overall project demand, Washow continued.
We remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and taking out costs. At the same time we are moving forward with important business opportunities such as our project in South Africa. While this is a very difficult business cycle, our actions today are driven with the benefit of more than 80 years of history and the confidence that markets will improve, Washow concluded
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the segment results schedules included in this press release.
 The following details the components of sales by segment for the 2009 second quarter compared to the prior years second quarter.
Net sales:
 
 
 
AMCOL Q2 2009 EARNINGS
Page 3 of 13
:  The majority of the decrease in the quarters revenue was due to lower volumes in the U.S. metal casting and basic minerals product lines, partially offset by price increases.   Freight pass-through revenue accounted for approximately 27% of the total segments decrease, principally from the pet products and metal castings divisions.   Foreign currency fluctuations represented approximately 15% of the decrease in revenue principally due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar.
Minerals
:  Foreign currency fluctuations represented approximately 43% of the revenue decrease, primarily due to the weakening of the British pound and the Polish zloty against the U.S. dollar.   The remaining revenue decrease in base business was principally due to lower demand in the U.S. for our lining technology products and services provided  by our contracting services group.
E
nvironmental
   Lower demand for oil and natural gas has reduced oil production activity, driving the lower revenue in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.   Domestic base business revenues declined in the current quarter, except for our water treatment business which continues to have strong demand.
Oilfield Services:
Compared to the prior year quarter, international sales were down substantially in Nigeria and the UK due to lower demand for our services.  Brazil, which had no revenues in the prior year quarter, and Malaysia both experienced solid growth.  The Premium Reeled Tubing (PRT), acquisition added $4.0 million of revenue in the quarter.
  Reductions in fuel-surcharge revenue represented 57% of the revenue decrease; the remaining decrease was due to reduced demand for consumer product shipments.
Transportation:
  Gross profit decreased $15.5 million, or 24.8%, from the 2008 second  quarter while gross margin was 27.5%, a 70 basis point improvement from the 2008 quarter.
Gross profit:
Gross profit decreased $3.4 million, or 18.7%, from the 2008 quarter while gross margins improved 270 basis points to 19.8%. The gross margin improvement is principally due to domestic pricing initiatives put in place in 2008, capacity and headcount reductions in our domestic operation, and lower energy costs at our mining and processing facilities.  These benefits are partially offset by decreased volumes.
Minerals:
: Gross profit decreased $7.3 million, or 27.3%, from the 2008 quarter while gross margins increased 90 basis points to 35.3%; the margin increase is due to lower input costs, principally resin, and lower freight costs due to the reduction in energy costs.  These benefits are partially offset by decreased volumes.
Environmental

Page 4 of 13
  Gross profit decreased $4.4 million, or 27.9%, from the 2008 quarter and gross margin decreased 640 basis points to 35.4%.  The reduction in gross margin is due to increased pricing pressure in certain domestic services.
Oilfield Services:
  Gross profit had a small decrease over the prior year quarter and gross margin improved 160 basis points to 11.6% due to lower energy costs.
Transportation:
 GS&A expenses decreased $5.8 million, a 14.9% decrease over the prior year quarter.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
   GS&A decreased $0.7 million, a 7.1% decrease from the 2008 quarter, the majority of the decline being due to foreign exchange fluctuations  and reductions in personnel related costs both being partially offset by increased bad debts in the U.S.
Minerals:
:  GS&A decreased $2.2 million, a 15.4% decrease from the 2008 quarter.  The majority of the reduction was due to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily due to the weakening of the British pound and the Polish zloty against the U.S. dollar.  We also decreased our personnel related costs.
Environmental
:  GS&A decreased $0.1 million, a 1.3% decrease from the 2008 quarter.  Cost reductions were partially offset by increased costs from the PRT acquisition.
Oilfield Services
GS&A decreased $2.8 million from the 2008 quarter due to improved performance in non-qualified pension plan assets and lower personnel, IT and consulting costs.
Corporate:  
  Net interest expense increased by $0.3 million over the prior year quarter due to higher average debt levels.
Interest expense:
Other, net of $1.5 million decreased $2.3 million, compared to the 2008 quarter gain of $0.8 million, principally due to foreign currency transaction losses.
Other, net:  
The effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2009 was 17.0% compared with 26.4% for the same period in 2008. The fact that a greater proportion of our income is generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions (principally foreign countries) accounts for the significant reduction in our tax rate.  
Income taxes: 
  Losses from affiliates and joint ventures of $1.6 million increased $1.0 million compared to the prior year quarter.  This is principally due to losses  with our Russian, Japanese and Dutch investments.
Income and losses from affiliates and joint ventures:

  Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were comparable for the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and 2008 at 30.9 million shares.
Share count:
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
Long-term debt decreased $26.8 million to $230.1 million at June 30, 2009 compared to $256.8 million at December 31, 2008.  The reduction was primarily due to a decrease in working capital levels and lower capital expenditures.Total long-term debt represented 41.1% of capitalization at June 30, 2009, compared with 43.9% at December 31, 2008.  Cash and cash equivalents were $21.4 million at June 30, 2009 compared with $19.4 million at December 31, 2008.
 
Working capital decreased to $208.1 million at June 30, 2009 from $262.7 million at December 31, 2008.  The reduction in working capital was due to a combination of lower volumes and continued efforts to reduce working capital.
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $65.5 million for year-to-date June 30, 2009 compared to a cash outflow of  $2.0 million in the prior year period.  This increase was principally due to the decrease in working capital, offset by the reduction in net income.
Excluding our corporate building and $15.1 million of expenditures for our purchase of a chrome mine in South Africa, capital expenditures in the 2009 period were $17.3 million compared with $23.3 million in the prior year period.  The reduction in adjusted capital expenditures is due to our limiting capital expenditures to maintenance and minimal expansion projects in 2009.
Dividends declared year-to-date through June 30, 2009 increased by 13.9 % over the prior year period to $11.0 million.

On July 27, 1987, AMCOL International Corporation (the Company) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Amendment No. 1 to the Companys Registration Statement on Form 10 (the Amended Form 10), which included a description of the Companys common stock.  This Amended Form 10 was filed via paper submission.  In order to make the description of the Companys common stock included in the Amended Form 10 accessible via EDGAR, the Company is re-filing the description herein.
 
Item 11Description of Registrants Securities to be Registered.
   
 
The holders of the Companys common stock, par value $1.00 per share, are entitled to one vote for each share held.  Stockholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes for the election of directors, and consequently the holders of a majority of the stock voting in the election of directors are able to elect all directors being elected.  The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the outstanding Common Stock is required to approve a merger, sale of more than $5,000,000 in assets or similar reorganization, unless such transaction was first approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors, a majority of the voting members of which were elected prior to the time the other corporate party to such reorganization became the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the common stock of the Company.  In this latter case the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding common stock is required.  The holders of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as the Board of Directors may declare out of funds available therefor and to receive pro rata all of the Companys assets available for distribution to stockholders in the event of liquidation.  The holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase or subscribe for shares of any class now or hereafter authorized.
 
The transfer agent for the Common Stock is Harris Trust and Savings Bank, Chicago, Illinois.
 
The Company intends to furnish its stockholders with quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information, and an annual report containing financial statements certified by independent public accountants.
 
The description of the Companys common stock set out above has since been amended as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation as restated and filed as an exhibit to the Companys Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on September 15, 1993, as amended and filed as an exhibit to the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 28, 1996, as further amended and filed as an exhibit to the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on July 20, 1998.
 
In addition, the Companys transfer agent for its common stock is no longer Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago, Illinois; it is now American Stock Transfer of New York, New York.
 
 
 
 
 
The description of the Companys common stock set out above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the provisions of the Companys restated certificate of incorporation and restated by-laws as amended and in effect on the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.  Copies of the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws as amended and restated have been filed with the SEC.

Our affiliates and joint ventures generated $0.9 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of losses in the current year compared to losses of $14.1 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, in the prior years comparable period.
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included later in this press release.
Although overall AMCOL revenue in the third quarter was still well behind the 2008 pace, there are some positive developments, said Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer.  Gross margins continue to improve across all segments. We continue to reduce debt as our focus on the balance sheet is producing results.
Washow continued, The Minerals segment did show stronger U.S. sales sequentially over second quarter 2009, as the cash for clunkers program helped increase foundry activity.  On a sequential quarter basis, our business in Asia is improving, and Europe, which has a significant consumer related business, had a good quarter as well.
The third quarter is typically the strongest for our Environmental segment and this year is no exception. Gross margins improved but the building materials business remains very soft around the world.  Our Lining Tech products are used in several markets and while the U.S. is well below last years pace, Europe is having a good year, Washow added.
Third quarter 2008 was the best quarter ever for our Oilfield Services segment but this years results reflect the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices. Gross margins continue to be in line but project activity is slow and predicting a return to growth is very difficult, Washow continued.
The sequential improvement in the Minerals segment is very encouraging and shows the result of our pricing approach as well as cost controls. There is more project activity in the Environmental segment, but customers are cautious about starting new projects. The Oilfield Services segment is very well positioned when the business returns.  All of our segments are prepared for growth but our key focus continues to be on the balance sheet and we expect continuing improvement in Q4, Washow concluded.

STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the segment results schedules included in this press release.
The following details the components of sales by segment for the 2009 third quarter compared to the prior years third quarter.
Net sales:
 
:  The majority of the decrease in the quarters revenue was due to lower volumes in the U.S. metal casting and basic minerals product lines, partially offset by price increases.  Pass-through freight revenue accounted for approximately 18.7% of the total segments decrease, principally from the pet products and basic minerals divisions.  Foreign currency fluctuations represented approximately 16.7% of the decrease in revenue principally due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar.
Minerals
:  Base business revenues decreased due to lower demand in the U.S. for our lining technology and building materials products and services provided by our contracting services group.  Foreign currency fluctuations represented approximately 38.0% of the revenue decrease, primarily due to the weakening of the British pound and the Polish zloty against the U.S. dollar.
Environmental
   Lower demand for oil and natural gas has reduced production activities, driving the decrease in revenue in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.  Domestic base business revenues declined across all services, compared to the prior year quarter.
Oilfield Services:
International revenue was down substantially in Nigeria and the United Kingdom compared to the prior year quarter due to lower demand for our services.  However, both Brazil and Malaysia continue to experience solid growth over the prior year quarter.
  Reductions in fuel-surcharge revenue represented 58.2% of the revenue decrease; the remaining decrease was due to reduced demand for consumer product shipments.
Transportation:
  Gross profit decreased $9.7 million, or 15.3%, from the 2008 third quarter while gross margin was 28.2%, a 310 basis point improvement from the 2008 quarter.
Gross profit:
Gross profit decreased $0.9 million, or 4.3%, from the 2008 quarter while gross margins improved 450 basis points to 22.2%. The gross margin improvement results principally from domestic pricing initiatives put in place in 2008.  The decrease in gross profit includes a net $2.0 million of write off expenses related to our domestic briquetting operations within our metalcasting group, due to reduced demand.  These expenses negatively affected gross margins by 230 basis points but is offset by improvements in our product mix and other businesses.
Minerals:

: Gross profit decreased $5.5 million, or 19.4%, from the 2008 quarter while gross margins increased 250 basis points to 35.5%; the margin increase is due to lower input costs, principally resin, and lower freight costs due to the reduction in energy costs.  These benefits were partially offset by decreased volumes.
Environmental
  Gross profit decreased $3.0 million, or 23.6%, from the 2008 quarter due to the reduction in revenues.
Oilfield Services:
  Gross profit decreased $0.3 million over the prior year quarter, and gross margin improved 190 basis points to 12.4%due to lower energy costs.
Transportation:
 
GS&A expenses decreased $1.6 million, or 4.4%, from the prior year quarter, mainly due to a $1.5 million decrease in our Environmental segments GS&A expenses.  This segments GS&A expenses decreased 11.3% largely due to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations resulting from a weakening of the British pound and Polish zloty against the U.S. dollar.  GS&A expenses in other segments remained relatively constant in each segment.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
 
  Net interest expense decreased by $0.6 million over the prior year quarterdue to reduced average debt levels.
Interest expense:
 
Other, net is primarily comprised of foreign currency exchange income and losses.  Other, net favorably impacted results in the 2009 period by $0.1 million versus $2.1 million of losses in the prior years comparable period.
Other, net:  
The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2009 was 19.8%, compared with 25.5% for the same period in 2008.  The reduction is due to a greater proportion of our income being generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions, principally foreign countries.  
Income taxes:  
  Income from affiliates and joint ventures of $0.7 million is principally due to one of our Indian joint ventures, Ashapura Volclay and improvements in our Russian joint venture.
Income and losses from affiliates and joint ventures:
This compares to losses of $14.7 million in the prior year period, primarily incurred in our largest Indian investment, Ashapura Minechem Limited.  This investment is accounted for under the equity method.  At December 31, 2008, we wrote off the balance of our investment and accordingly have discontinued recording additional losses from this affiliate.
  Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding were comparable for the quarters ended September 30, 2009 and 2008, differing by less than 1%.
Share count:

FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
Long-term debt decreased $39.7 million to $217.1 million at September 30, 2009, compared to $256.8 million at December 31, 2008.  The reduction was primarily due to reductions in working capital levels and minimizing capital expenditures.  Total long-term debt represented 38.4% of capitalization at September 30, 2009, compared with 43.9% at December 31, 2008.  Cash and cash equivalents remained the same at $19.4 million at September 30, 2009 as compared with December 31, 2008.
Working capital decreased to $212.9 million at September 30, 2009 from $262.7 million at December 31, 2008.  The reduction in working capital was due to a combination of lower sales volumes and continued efforts to reduce working capital.
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $90.6 million for year-to-date September 30, 2009 compared with $2.6 million in the prior year period.  This increase was principally due to the decrease in working capital.
Excluding our corporate building (which was a sale-leaseback transaction) and $15.1 million of expenditures for our purchase of a 53% investment in a chrome mine in South Africa, capital expenditures in the 2009 period were $24.5 million compared with $29.7 million in the prior year period.  The reduction in adjusted capital expenditures is due to our limiting capital expenditures to maintenance activities and minimal expansion projects in 2009.
Dividends declared year-to-date through September 30, 2009 increased by 9.1 % over the prior year period to $16.5 million.  Our dividend rate has remained constant at $0.18 per share since the third quarter of 2008.

Item 1.01         Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
Employment Agreements
On December 31, 2009, AMCOL International Corporation (the Company) entered into employment agreements with Michael Johnson and Robert Trauger, each an executive officer.  The agreements are effective as of January 1, 2010.
 
The initial employment term expires in March 2011, with a rolling three-month extension (unless either party gives three months advance notice).  Each agreement provides for an initial annual base salary as follows: Mr. Johnson - $265,566 and Mr. Trauger - $250,000.  These base salaries are subject to discretionary annual increases.  Further, each agreement provides for a performance-based annual cash bonus opportunity in an amount equal to at least 60% of the executives base salary.
 
If the Company terminates an executive without cause or the executive terminates his employment for good reason (as defined below) prior to a change of control of the Company (as defined below) or more than thirteen months after a change of control, the executive is entitled to receive the following: (1) accrued salary and bonus; (2) a pro-rata annual bonus; (3) base salary for eighteen months; and (4) continued health insurance coverage for the executive and his dependents at the Companys expense during a transition period, and thereafter at his own expense until the earlier of his eligibility for Medicare or his acceptance of another job.
 
If within thirteen months following a change of control, the Company terminates an executive without cause or the executive terminates his employment for good reason, or if in the thirteenth month following the transaction, the executive resigns for any reason, the executive is entitled to receive the following: (1) accrued salary, accrued bonus and a pro-rata annual bonus; (2) a lump sum equal to two times the sum of his salary and the greater of (i) 60% of his salary, or (ii) the average annual bonus for the previous three years; and (3) continued health insurance coverage for the executive and his dependents at the Companys expense until the earlier of (x) two years or (y) the date the executive accepts another job.  Thereafter, the executive may continue the health insurance coverage at his own expense until the earlier of his eligibility for Medicare or his acceptance of another job.  In certain cases, the executives are entitled to these benefits if a change of control occurs within twelve months following their termination of employment.  If a change of control occurs, all outstanding stock options, restricted stock and other equity compensation awards become fully vested and exercisable unless otherwise required under Internal Revenue Code section 162(m).
 
A change of control of the Company is defined as one or more of the following, subject to certain exemptions:  (1) any person (other than certain Company affiliates) acquires 50.1% or more of the Companys common stock; (2) the incumbent directors cease to constitute at least one-half of the Companys directors; or (3) the consummation by the Company of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, or similar transaction, or sale or other disposition of 50.1% of the consolidated assets of the Company.
 
Good reason is defined, subject to notice requirements and an opportunity for the Company to remedy the condition, as the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) any material breach of the employment agreement by the Company; (2) the Companys failure to assign the employment agreement to a successor or the successors failure to expressly assume and agree to be bound by the employment agreement; or (3) the assignment to the executive of any duties inconsistent with his powers and role or a material reduction of his powers and role.
 
 
 
 
If the executives employment terminates due to his death or disability prior to a change of control or more than thirteen months after a change of control, the executive or his beneficiaries are entitled to the executives accrued salary and bonus and the executives pro-rata annual bonus.  If the executives employment terminates due to his death or disability within thirteen months after a change of control, the executive or his beneficiaries are entitled to receive the compensation and benefits described above with respect to termination without cause after a change of control.
 
If, at any time, the Company terminates an executive for cause or, except as described above, the executive terminates his employment without good reason, the executive is entitled to his accrued salary and bonus, but shall not be entitled to any severance pay.
 
Under the agreements, in the event that the Companys financial statements are restated, the Board of Directors will review the circumstances to determine whether the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably and the executive received more compensation than he would have received absent the restated financial statements.  If the Board determines that management failed to act reasonably and the executive received excess compensation, the Board will take action to recoup the excess compensation and the executive agrees to repay such amount.
 
The agreements also contain confidentiality, and one year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in favor of the Company.

Intellectual Property
 
           To the extent applicable, pursuant to Illinois Employee Patent Act, the Company hereby notifies Executive that the preceding paragraph does not apply to any inventions for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Executives own time, unless: (i) the invention relates (a) to the Companys business, or (b) to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) the invention results from any work performed by the Executive for the Company.
(a)

           Executive agrees that upon disclosure of Work Product to the Company, Executive will, during his employment and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the Company execute and deliver all such documents and perform all such acts as the Company or its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection.
(b)
 
           In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executives signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to Work Product, whether because of Executives physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright and other analogous protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.

16
 
 
           .  In the event of a restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements, the Board will review the circumstances regarding the restatement and all performance-based compensation awarded to the Executive that is attributable to performance during the time periods restated.  If the Board determines that (i) the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably and (ii) the Executive received more compensation than he would have received absent the restated financial statements, then the Board will take action to recoup any such excess compensation and the Executive agrees to repay such amount.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in such event, the Executive may be required to (x) repay some or all of any bonus or other performance-based compensation received, (y) repay any gains realized on the exercise of stock options or on the open-market sale of vested shares; or (z) have his future compensation adjusted.  In the event the Executive does not agree with the Boards determination as to (A)  whether the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably or (B) the amount of the excess compensation received, the Executive may submit the matter to binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois (unless the parties agree in writing to a different location), before a single arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect. The decision and award made by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties hereto for all purposes, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Except as set forth below, the Company shall pay the costs of the arbitration, including administrative fees and the fees of the arbitrator.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if payment of any amounts under this Agreement would be subject to additional taxes and interest under Code Section 409A because the timing of such payments is not delayed as provided in Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, then any such payments to which Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of his Termination of Employment shall be accumulated and paid on the second business day that is six months after the date of such Termination of Employment with Company, or such earlier date upon which such payments can be paid under Code Section 409A of the Code without being subject to such additional taxes and interest.

The Board of Directors of the Company (the Board), has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the Company will have the continued dedication of the Executive, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined herein).  The Board believes it is imperative to diminish the inevitable distraction of the Executive by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks created by a pending or threatened Change of Control and to encourage the Executives full attention and dedication to the Company in the event of any threatened or pending Change of Control, and to provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements upon a Change of Control that ensure that the compensation and benefits expectations of the Executive will be satisfied and that provide the Executive with compensation and benefits arrangements that are competitive with those of other corporations. In addition, the Board believes it is necessary to provide a severance package that assures that the Company is able to attract and retain the highest quality executive talent and to ensure that the post-employment non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions are enforceable.  Therefore, in order to accomplish these objectives, the Board has caused the Company to enter into this Agreement.

(a)
 
           Executive agrees that during and after his employment he shall not remove, copy, duplicate or otherwise reproduce, use or permit to be used any notes, memoranda, reports, lists, records, drawings, sketches, specifications, software programs, data, documentation or other materials of any nature relating to any matter within the scope of the business of the Company or concerning any of its dealings or affairs except as required to perform Executives duties for the Company;
(b)
 
13
 
 
           Upon cessation of his employment relationship with the Company, Executive shall immediately deliver to the Company all Confidential Information and other materials relating to the Company in his possession or delivered to him by the Company, including computer programs, files, notes, records, memoranda, reports, lists, drawings, sketches, specifications, data, charts, and other documents, materials and things (Materials), whether or not containing Confidential Information, whether or not prepared by Executive, it being agreed that all Materials shall be and remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company;

If, at the time of enforcement of Sections 7.1 and 7.2, a court shall hold that the duration, scope, area or activity restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the maximum duration, scope, area or activity restrictions reasonable and enforceable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope, area or activity restrictions.
 
           .

Accordingly, Executive acknowledges that in addition to any and all remedies at law, the Company shall be entitled, without bond, to specific performance or injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent the breach or threatened breach of Executives obligations under this Agreement.
7.3
Remedies
 
           .  During the employment period, Executive shall disclose immediately to the Company all ideas, inventions and business plans that he makes, conceives, discovers or develops during the course of his employment with the Company, including any inventions, modifications, discoveries, developments, improvements, computer programs, processes, products or procedures (whether or not protectable upon application by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights) (Work Product) that: (i) relate to the business of the Company or any customer or supplier to the Company or any of the products or services being developed, manufactured, sold or otherwise provided by the Company or that may be used in relation therewith; (ii) result from tasks assigned to Executive by the Company; or (iii) result from the use of the premises or personal property (whether tangible or intangible) owned, leased or contracted for by the Company.  Executive agrees that any Work Product shall be the property of the Company and, if subject to copyright, shall be considered a work made for hire within the meaning of the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the Act).  If and to the extent that any such Work Product is found as a matter of law not to be a work made for hire within the meaning of the Act, Executive expressly assigns to the Company all right, title and or interest in and to the Work Product, and all copies thereof, and the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret and all their proprietary rights in the Work Product, without further consideration, free from any claim, lien for balance due or rights of retention thereto on the part of Executive.
7.4
Intellectual Property
 
           To the extent applicable, pursuant to Illinois Employee Patent Act, the Company hereby notifies Executive that the preceding paragraph does not apply to any inventions for which no equipment, supplies, facility, or trade secret information of the Company was used and which was developed entirely on the Executives own time, unless: (i) the invention relates (a) to the Companys business, or (b) to the Companys actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development, or (ii) the invention results from any work performed by the Executive for the Company.
(a)
 
15
 
 
           Executive agrees that upon disclosure of Work Product to the Company, Executive will, during his employment and at any time thereafter, at the request and cost of the Company execute and deliver all such documents and perform all such acts as the Company or its duly authorized agents may reasonably require: (i) to apply for, obtain and vest in the name of the Company alone (unless the Company otherwise directs) letters patent, copyrights or other analogous protection in any country throughout the world, and when so obtained or vested to renew and restore the same; and (ii) to defend any opposition proceedings in respect of such applications and any opposition proceedings or petitions or applications for revocation of such letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection.
(b)
 
           In the event that the Company is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Executives signature on any letters patent, copyright or other analogous protection relating to Work Product, whether because of Executives physical or mental incapacity or for any other reason whatsoever, Executive hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as his agent and attorney-in-fact, to act for and on his behalf to execute and file any such application or applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent, copyright and other analogous protection with the same legal force and effect as if personally executed by Executive.
(c)
 
 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any amount or benefit to be paid or provided under this Agreement would be an Excess Parachute Payment within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code or any successor provision thereto(which the parties agree will not include any portion of payments allocated to the non-solicitation and non-compete provisions of Article VII which are classified as payments of reasonable compensation for purposes of Section 280G of the Code), then the payments and benefits to be paid or provided under this Agreement shall be reduced to the minimum extent necessary so that no portion of any such payment or benefit as so reduced constitutes an Excess Parachute Payment.
 
16
 
 
           .  In the event of a restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements, the Board will review the circumstances regarding the restatement and all performance-based compensation awarded to the Executive that is attributable to performance during the time periods restated.  If the Board determines that (i) the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably and (ii) the Executive received more compensation than he would have received absent the restated financial statements, then the Board will take action to recoup any such excess compensation and the Executive agrees to repay such amount.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in such event, the Executive may be required to (x) repay some or all of any bonus or other performance-based compensation received, (y) repay any gains realized on the exercise of stock options or on the open-market sale of vested shares; or (z) have his future compensation adjusted.  In the event the Executive does not agree with the Boards determination as to (A)  whether the restatement is required due to the failure of the Companys management to act reasonably or (B) the amount of the excess compensation received, the Executive may submit the matter to binding arbitration in Chicago, Illinois (unless the parties agree in writing to a different location), before a single arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Associations National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes then in effect. The decision and award made by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive on all parties hereto for all purposes, and judgment may be entered thereon in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Except as set forth below, the Company shall pay the costs of the arbitration, including administrative fees and the fees of the arbitrator.  Each party shall be responsible for the fees and costs of their attorneys and  the expenses of their witnesses.

Full Settlement
 
           .

9.4
No Mitigation
 
           .  If the Company fails to pay any amount provided under this Agreement when due, the Company shall pay interest on such amount at an annual rate equal to the lesser of (i) (A) the highest rate of interest charged by the Companys principal lender on its revolving credit agreements plus 200 basis points, or (B) in the absence of such a lender, 200 basis points over the prime commercial lending rate announced by The Wall Street Journal in effect from time to time during the period of such nonpayment, or (ii) the highest legally-permissible interest rate allowed to be charged under applicable law.

ITEM 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits
   
(d)           The following exhibit is furnished with this document:

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) today reported 2009 fourth quarter net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders of $0.36 per diluted share as compared to break even results per diluted share in the prior years period.  The 2009 results include benefits of $0.05 per diluted share for resolution of certain income tax matters and gains on the sale of a portion of our investment in Ashapura Minechem Limited (AML).  The 2008 results include expenses of $0.28 per diluted share for losses on derivative instruments held by AML as well as losses on our derivative instrument used to hedge the purchase price of our South African chrome mine.
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL., January 22, 2010 
Net sales decreased 13.9% to $176.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2009 from $205.2 million in the 2008 period.  Operating profit decreased by 34.4% over the 2008 fourth quarter to $10.3 million.  Foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on our results for the quarter.
Our affiliates and joint ventures generated quarterly income amounting to $0.03 per diluted share as compared to losses of $0.25 per diluted share in the prior year period.
For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2009, net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders was $1.12 per diluted share versus $0.82 per diluted share in the prior year.  Similar to the 2008 quarterly results discussed above, the 2008 annual results include expenses of $0.89 per diluted share for the same losses from AML and South African chrome mine derivatives.
Net sales for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2009 decreased 20.4% to $703.2 million, compared with $883.6 million for the 2008 period.  Foreign currency fluctuations had a $42.5 million unfavorable impact offset by $9.6 million in new revenue from acquisitions.  Operating profit declined by 32.5% over the 2008 period to $53.5 million.  Foreign currency fluctuations and acquisitions had unfavorable impacts of $5.1 million and $1.4 million, respectively, on current year operating profit.

This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included later in this press release.
The fourth quarter is usually very challenging and 2009 was no exception. While we are pleased with the results overall and see continuing progress in most segments, Oilfield Services had a very difficult quarter, said Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer.  We continued to improve our balance sheet through better working capital utilization and debt reduction.
Washow continued, The Minerals segment finished the year with some positive momentum. Even though revenue is down 14% from the prior year period, gross margins are about the same. The U.S. foundry market continued to slowly recover and overall business levels in Asia and Europe have improved.
The Environmental segment revenue was down more than 10% from the same quarter last year but better gross margins helped bring the operating profit almost to the 2008 levels. Europe was the key positive factor in the quarter. We still do not foresee a significant rebound in commercial construction, Washow added.
Demand for our Oilfield Services has not yet recovered. The late season hurricane took out nearly a week of activity as the Gulf of Mexico was evacuated. Most customers approached year end very cautiously as there is still a great deal of uncertainty about future oil and natural gas pricing. Long term, we are comfortable that demand will rebound for the range of services we have to offer, Washow continued.
We are encouraged about the improvement in our balance sheet this year and look to continue to manage it well as the business levels start to recover. Including our South African chrome project, we have some exciting new business coming on line later this year. If the global economic environment improves, we are well positioned in all of our segments to return to growth in 2010, Washow concluded.
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the segment results schedules included in this press release.
The following details the components of sales by segment for the 2009 fourth quarter as compared to the prior years fourth quarter.
Net sales:

:  The majority of the decrease in the quarters revenue was due to lower volumes in the U.S. metalcasting and basic minerals product lines, partially offset by volume recoveries in Europe and Asia.  Pass-through freight revenue accounted for approximately 40.3% of the decrease, principally from the pet products division.  Foreign currency did not have a material impact on revenues in the quarter.
Minerals
:  Base business revenues decreased due to lower demand in the U.S. for our lining technology and building materials products, and services provided by our contracting services group. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in Europe and the Middle East.
Environmental
Lower demand for oil and natural gas has reduced production activities, driving the decrease in revenue in the current quarter compared to the prior year quarter.  Overall base business revenues declined in all geographies except Australia.
Oilfield Services:   
  Reductions in fuel-surcharge revenue represented 35% of the revenue decrease; the remaining decrease was due to reduced demand for consumer product shipments.
Transportation:
  Gross profit decreased $8.4 million, or 16.0%, from the 2008 fourth   quarter while gross margin declined 60 basis points.
Gross profit:
Gross profit decreased $3.6 million, or 14.9%, from the 2008 quarter while gross margin reduced 30 basis points to 22.7%, principally due to lower volumes.
Minerals:
: Gross profit decreased $1.1 million, or 6.5%, from the 2008 quarter while gross margins increased 130 basis points to 31.3%.  The improvement in gross margin is due to lower input costs, principally resin, and lower freight costs due to the reduction in energy costs.  These benefits were partially offset by decreased volumes.
Environmental
Gross profit and gross margin decreased $3.3 million, or 35.2%, and 530 basis points from the 2008 quarter due to the reduction in revenues, particularly on higher margin products.
Oilfield Services:  
GS&A expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 8.0% from the prior year quarter.  All segments had reductions in GS&A expenses except Oilfield Services, principally due to lower personnel related, bad debt and consulting expenses.  Oilfield Services expense was higher, principally due to increased R&D spending and IT expenses.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):

Other, net includes foreign currency exchange income and losses, and other gains and losses.   The $5.1 million improvement, is primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses of $3.8 million in the prior year quarter compared to a $0.6 million gain in the current quarter.  The current period also includes a $0.7 million gain on the sale of a portion of our investment in AML, one of our Indian investments.
Other, net:  
  Our 2009 fourth quarter results include an income tax benefit of $0.9 million versus an expense of $1.2 million in the prior year period.  The benefit arises from certain adjustments related to the completion of an IRS audit.  Excluding the benefit, the comparable effective annual tax rates are 16.2% for 2009 and 24.5% for 2008, reflecting an improvement arising from a greater proportion of our income being generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions, principally foreign countries, as well as an increase in certain tax benefits in our domestic operations.  
Income taxes:
  Excluding the $8.1 million loss from our investment in AML in the 2008 quarter, income from affiliates and joint ventures improved $0.6 million to $1.0 million as these investments, similar to our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries in the mineral business, have seen a slight improvement in general economic conditions.
Income and losses from affiliates and joint ventures:
  The difference in our weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding for the quarters ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 did not impact EPS.
Share count:
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
Long-term debt decreased $49.8 million to $207 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $256.8 million at December 31, 2008.  The reduction was primarily due to our decreasing working capital levels and minimizing capital expenditures.  Total long-term debt represented 35% of capitalization at December 31, 2009, compared with 44% at December 31, 2008.  Cash and cash equivalents increased $8.2 million to $27.7 million at December 31, 2009, compared to December 31, 2008.  As a result of our sale of a portion of our investment in Ashapura, we are now accounting for this investment as an available for sale security with changes in fair value being reflected in other comprehensive income; as a result, we recorded this investment at its fair value at December 31, 2009 of $25.6 million.
Net non-cash working capital decreased $66.9 million from December 31, 2008 to $176.3 million at December 31, 2009.  The reduction in working capital was due to a combination of lower sales volumes and continued efforts to reduce working capital.

Cash flow generated from operating activities was $122.4 million for year-to-date December 31, 2009 compared with $18.4 million in the prior year period.  This increase was principally due to the decrease in working capital.
Adjusting for our corporate building (which was a sale-leaseback transaction) and $15.1 million of expenditures for our investment in a chrome mine in South Africa, capital expenditures in the 2009 period were $35.6 million compared with $44.1 million in the prior year period.  The reduction in adjusted capital expenditures is due to our limiting capital expenditures to maintenance activities and minimal expansion projects in 2009.
Dividends declared year-to-date through December 31, 2009 increased by 6.9% over the prior year period to $22.1 million.  Our dividend rate has remained constant at $0.18 per quarter per share since the fourth quarter of 2008.

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports First Quarter Results
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL -- (Marketwire - April 21, 2010) - AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) today reported 2010 first quarter net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders of $0.20 per diluted share as compared to $0.14 per diluted share in the prior year's period.
Net sales increased 6.4% to $175.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2010 from $164.4 million in the 2009 period. Foreign currency fluctuations had a favorable 3.8% impact on our sales results for the quarter. As compared to the prior year's first quarter, operating profit increased marginally and our losses from affiliates and joint ventures approximated the same amount. Our interest expense was less than the prior year's quarter as it benefited from overall lower average interest rates as well as the significant amount of debt reduction throughout 2009.
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included later in this press release.
"Given the range of our business segments, the results of our first quarter are often unpredictable. However, we are pleased that our consolidated revenue increased by more than 6% when compared to Q1 2009," said Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. "The quarter showed strengthening in our Minerals and Materials business, but our Environmental results were severely impacted by the unusually cold weather around the world. We did see sequential improvement in Oilfield Services, but margins have not yet returned to their historical levels."
Washow continued, "Our Minerals & Materials segment improved globally with a rebound in the US metalcasting market leading the way as the automotive and heavy equipment industry sales were up substantially over last year. Asia continues to build on the increased activity we saw in late 2009, and Europe is strengthening as well."
"Our Environmental segment results were disappointing as sales were down almost 14% from last year. The weather had a significant impact on our business as the long winter delayed several projects. Commercial construction is still very slow in most regions. This segment is seasonal so we will see the traditional strengthening in the next two quarters," Washow added.
"Oilfield Service activity did increase somewhat this quarter which helped improve the sequential sales and margins but we are still down from the same period last year. Greater oil prices are helping, but this is offset somewhat by continued low natural gas pricing. We do expect a positive impact from our international activity as we continue to focus on global expansion of this segment," Washow continued.
"While we are a long way from where we want to be, we are encouraged with the improving Minerals & Materials business as it was the first to show the impact of the economic slowdown and may be a leading indicator of the improving economic environment. The worst winter in many years slowed the start of the Environmental business but there are many projects that will ship in the months ahead. We will continue to focus on the balance sheet while we look for stronger growth in 2010," Washow concluded.
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the segment results schedules included in this press release.
Net sales: The following details the components of sales by segment for the 2010 first quarter as compared to the prior year's first quarter.
Minerals and Materials: The majority of the increase in the quarter's revenue was due to increased volumes, principally in our domestic and Asian metalcasting divisions. These divisions benefited from greater demand as castings for automobiles and heavy equipment has increased. Approximately 16% of the increase in sales results from favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.
Environmental: Organic revenues decreased primarily due to inclement weather conditions domestically as well as in Europe. The conditions delayed the sales of products and services, especially those within our Lining Technologies and Contracting Services, as construction jobs themselves were delayed. These reductions were somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency rate movements, primarily in our European currencies.
Oilfield Services: Continued domestic competition and uncertainty as to future natural gas prices resulted in lower revenues within this segment. Our international operations experienced an increase in revenues, however, as our Australian operations benefited from a large contract.
Transportation: Increased fuel-surcharge revenue represented 59% of the increase in revenues; the remaining increase was due to increased shipments.
Gross profit: Gross profit increased $1.3 million, or 3.1%, from the 2009 first quarter while gross margin decreased 80 basis points.
Minerals: Gross profit increased $8.0 million, or 49.6%, from the 2009 quarter, and gross margins increased 460 basis points to 24.8%, principally due to greater volumes and increased operating efficiencies.
Environmental: Gross profit decreased $3.1 million, or 22.0%, from the 2009 quarter. Gross margins also decreased 310 basis points to 28.8%. The decrease in gross margin results from the lower volumes.
Oilfield Services: Gross profit and gross margin decreased $3.6 million, or 30.9%, and 990 basis points from the 2009 quarter due to the reduction in revenues, particularly in capital intensive operating divisions.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A): GS&A expenses increased $0.7 million, or 2.2%, from the prior year quarter. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates had a large impact in our Minerals and Materials and Environmental segments, a $0.9 million combined impact. Increased employee compensation and benefits expenses within our Minerals and Materials segment accounted for the remainder of the increase. GS&A expenses within our Oilfield Services and Transportation segments remained relatively constant as compared to the prior year. Our Corporate segment GS&A expenses decreased due to reduced employee benefit expenses, especially those related to our pension benefits.
Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net decreased $1.2 million due to lower average debt levels and reduced overall average interest rates. In 2009, we reduced debt levels by $50 million, and thus the 2010 debt levels were significantly lower than those that existed in the prior year's comparable quarter.
Other, net: Other, net is comprised mostly of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The $0.8 million improvement is primarily due to fewer losses on foreign currency exchange transactions.
Income taxes: Our 2010 first quarter results include income tax expense of $2.2 million versus an expense of $1.6 million in the prior year period. The increased expense results from greater pre-tax income. The effective tax rate decreased, however, as a greater portion of this pre-tax income was generated in our overseas operations, which typically have tax rates which are less than those in effect in the United States.
Share count: Our weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased 1.6% to 31.4 million; this did not affect EPS.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
Long-term debt increased $6.0 million to $213.0 million at March 31, 2010, compared to $207.0 million at December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to our increased working capital levels and capital expenditures. Total long-term debt, net represented 36.0% of capitalization at March 31, 2010, compared with 35.3% at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $4.3 million to $23.4 million at March 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009.
Net working capital increased $8.3 million from December 31, 2009 to $212.0 million at March 31, 2010. The increase in working capital was due to increased sales volumes.
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $8.6 million for year-to-date March 31, 2010 compared with $40.7 million in the prior year period. In 2009, we decreased our working capital levels significantly in response to the economic recession. Thus, we generated significantly less cash flows from operations in the 2010 period as working capital levels increased from their December 31, 2009 levels in response to increased sales and seasonality.
Non-corporate building capital expenditures in the 2010 period were $7.5 million less than the prior year's comparable period, which included $15.1 million of expenditures to purchase our chrome mine in South Africa. Capital expenditures related to our South Africa operations were $11.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010.
Dividends through March 31, 2010 remained roughly the same over the prior year period as our dividend rate has remained constant at $0.18 per quarter per share since the third quarter of 2008.

The Committee may at the time of granting any SAR add such additional conditions and limitations to the SAR as it shall deem advisable, including, but not limited to, limitations on the period or periods within which the SAR shall be exercisable and the maximum amount of appreciation to be recognized with regard to such SAR. Any ISO or NSO or portion thereof which is surrendered with a SAR shall no longer be ex ercisable. A SAR that is not granted in conjunction with an ISO or NSO shall terminate on such date as is specified by the Committee in the SAR agreement and shall vest in accordance with Section 11.02. The Committee, in its sole discretion, may allow the Company to settle all or part of the Companys obligation arising out of the exercise of a SAR by the payment of cash equal to the aggregate Fair Market Value of the shares of Common Stock which the Company would otherwise be obligated to deliver.
To exercise an Option in whole or in part, a Participant (or, after his death, his executor or administrator) must give written notice to the Committee, stating the number of shares with respect to which he intends to exercise the Option. The Company will issue the shares with respect to which the Option is exercised upon

payment in full of the Option Price. The Committee may permit the Option Price to be paid in cash or shares of Common Stock held by the Participant having an aggregate Fair Market Value, as determined on the date of delivery, equal to the Option Price, provided such shares of Common Stock meet such criteria as the Committee shall from time to time establish (e.g. that such shares are mature shares under generally accepted accounting principles). The Committee may permit a Participant to elect to pay the Option Price upon the exercise of an Option by authorizing a third party to sell shares of Common Stock (or a sufficient portion of the shares) acquired upon exercise of the Option and remit to the Company a sufficient portion of the sale proceeds to pay the entire Option Price and any tax withholding resulting from such exer cise. The Committee may also permit the Option Price to be paid by any other method permitted by law, including by delivery to the Committee from the Participant of an election directing the Company to withhold the number of shares of Common Stock from the Common Stock otherwise due upon exercise of the Option having an aggregate Fair Market Value on that date equal to the Option Price. If a Participant pays the Option Price with shares of Common Stock which were received by the Participant upon exercise of one or more ISOs, and such Common Stock has not been held by the Participant for at least the greater of:
the use of the shares shall constitute a disqualifying disposition and the ISO underlying the shares used to pay the Option Price shall no longer satisfy all of the requirements of Code section 422.
11.01           . A Participant may not exercise an Option until it has vested. The portion of an Award of Options that is vested depends upon the period that has elapsed since the Award Date. The following schedule applies to any Award of Options under this Plan unless the Committee establishes a different vesting schedule:
Options
Notwithstanding the above schedule, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a Participants Awards shall become fully vested if a Participants employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates or service on the board of directors of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate is terminated due to: (i) retirement on or after his sixty-fifth birthday; (ii) retirement on or after his fifty-fifth birthday with consent of the Company; (iii) retirement at any age on account of total and permanent disability as determined by the Company; or (iv) death. Unless the Committee otherwise provides or the preceding sentence of this Section or Section 11.03 applies, if a Participants employment with or service to the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate terminates for any other reason, any Awards that are not yet vested are immediately and automatically forfeited; provided, however, in such special circumstances as the Committee deems appropriate, the Committee may take such action as it deems equitable in the circumstances or in the best interests of the Company, including, without limitation, fully vesting an Award or waiving or modifying any other limitation or requirement under the Award.
A Participants employment shall not be considered to be terminated hereunder by reason of a transfer of his employment from the Company to a Subsidiary or Affiliate, or vice versa, or a leave of absence approved by the Participants employer. A Participants employment shall be considered to be terminated hereunder if, as a result of a sale or other transaction, the Participants employer ceases to be a Subsidiary or Affiliate (and the Participants employer is or becomes an entity that is separate from the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates).
 
10
 
11.02       . The Committee shall establish the vesting schedule to apply to any Award of Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or SAR that is not associated with an ISO or NSO granted under the Plan to a Participant, and in the absence of such a vesting schedule set forth in the Agreement evidencing the Award, such Award shall vest in accordance with Section 11.01.
Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and SARs
11.03        Notwithstanding Sections 11.01 and 11.02 above, if within 12 months following a Change of Control the employment of a Participant with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates is terminated without Cause or the Participant resigns for Good Reason, any Award issued to the Participant shall be fully vested, and in the case of an Award other than an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, fully exercisable for 90 days following the date on which the Participants service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates is terminated, but not beyond the date the Award would otherwise expire but for the Participants termination of employmen t.
Effect of Change of Control.
12.01       . If there is any change in the corporate structure or shares of the Company (a Corporate Transaction), the Committee may make appropriate adjustments, including, but not limited to, such adjustments deemed necessary to prevent accretion, or to protect against dilution, in the number and kind of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Awards may be granted under this Plan (including the maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which Awards may be granted under this Plan in the aggregate and individually to any Participant during any calendar year as specified in Section 3) and, with respect to outstanding Awards, in the number and kind of shares covered thereby and in the applicable Option Price. For the purposes of this Section 12, a Corporate Transaction includes, without limitation, any change resulting from a recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, consolidation, rights offering, separation, reorganization, or liquidation (including a partial liquidation) and any transaction in which shares of Common Stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares of stock or other securities of the Company or another corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that a Corporate Transaction involves a nonreciprocal transaction between the Company and its stockholders that causes the per-share fair value of the Common Stock underlying outstanding awards under this Plan to change, such as a stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, rights offering, or recapitalization through a large nonrecurring cash dividend (an Equity Restructuring), the Committee shall be required to make or provide for such adjustments set forth above that, in its sole discretion, are required to equalize the value of the outstanding awards under this Plan before and after the Equity Restructuring.
Adjustments
12.02       . In the event of an extraordinary dividend or other distribution, merger, reorganization, consolidation, combination, sale of assets, split up, exchange, or spin off, or other extraordinary corporate transaction, the Committee may, in such manner and to such extent (if any) as it deems appropriate and equitable, make provision for a cash payment or for the substitution or exchange of any or all outstanding Awards for the cash, securities or property deliverable to the holder of any or all outstanding Awards based upon the distribution or consideration payable to holders of Common Stock upon or in respect of such event; provided, however, in each case, that with respect to any ISO no such adjustment may be made that wou ld cause the Plan to violate section 422 of the Code (or any successor provision).
Cashouts
12.03       . Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 12 hereof to Awards that are considered deferred compensation within the meaning of section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements of section 409A of the Code unless the Participant consents otherwise; (ii) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan to Awards that are not considered deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that after such adjustment, the Awards either continue not to be subject to section 409A of the Code or comply with the requirements of section 409A of the Code unless the Participant consents otherwise; and (iii) the Committee shall not have the authority to make any adjustments pursuant to Section 12 of the Plan to the extent that the existence of such authority would cause an Award that is not intended to be subject to section 409A of the Code to be subject thereto.
Section 409A
 
11
 
13.01       . ISOs are not transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code. During a Participants lifetime, his ISOs may be exercised only by him.
ISOs
13.02       . All Awards granted pursuant to this Plan other than ISOs are transferable by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order as defined by the Code, or in the Committees discretion after vesting. With the approval of the Committee, a Participant may transfer an Award (other than an ISO) for no consideration to or for the benefit of one or more Family Members of the Participant subject to such limits as the Committee may establish, and the transferee shall remain subject to all the terms and conditions applicable to the Award prior to such transfer. The transfer of an Award pursuant to this Section 13 shall include a transfer of the right set fort h in Section 18 hereof to consent to an amendment or revision of the Plan and, in the discretion of the Committee, shall also include transfer of ancillary rights associated with the Award. The provisions of this Section 13 shall not apply to any Common Stock issued pursuant to an Award for which all restrictions have lapsed and is fully vested.
Awards Other Than ISOs
14.01       . The purpose of this Section 14 is to provide the Committee the ability to qualify Awards of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units as Qualified Performance-Based Awards. If the Committee, in its discretion, decides to grant to a Covered Employee an Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that is intended to constitute a Qualified Performance-Based Award, the provisions of this Section 14 shall control over any contrary provision contained herein; provided, however, that the Committee may in its discretion grant Awards of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units to Covered Employees that are based on Performance Criteria or Performance Goals but that do not satisfy the requirements of this Section 14.
Purpose
14.02       . This Section 14 shall apply only to those Covered Employees selected by the Committee to receive Qualified Performance-Based Awards. The designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for a Performance Period shall not in any manner entitle the Participant to receive an Award for the relevant Performance Period. Moreover, designation of a Covered Employee as a Participant for a particular Performance Period shall not require designation of such Covered Employee as a Participant in any subsequent Performance Period and designation of one Covered Employee as a Participant shall not require designation of any other Covered Employees as a Participant in such period or in any other period.
Applicability
14.03       . To the extent necessary to comply with the Qualified Performance-Based Award requirements of section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, with respect to any Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units that may be granted to one or more Covered Employees, no later than 90 days following the commencement of any fiscal year in question or any other designated fiscal period or period of service (or such other time as may be required or permitted by section 162(m) of the Code), the Committee shall, in writing, (a) designate one or more Covered Employees, (b) select the Performance Criteria applicable to the Performance Period, (c) establish the Performance Goals, and amoun ts of such Awards, as applicable, which may be earned for such Performance Period, and (d) specify the relationship between Performance Criteria and the Performance Goals and the amounts of such Awards, as applicable, to be earned by each Covered Employee for such Performance Period. Following the completion of each Performance Period, the Committee shall certify in writing whether the applicable Performance Goals have been achieved for such Performance Period. No Award or portion thereof that is subject to the satisfaction of any condition shall be considered to be earned or vested until the Committee certifies in writing that the conditions to which the distribution, earning or vesting of such Award is subject have been achieved. The Committee may not increase during a year the amount of a Qualified Performance-Based Award that would otherwise be payable upon satisfaction of the conditions but may reduce or eliminate the payments as provided for in the agreement evidencing the Award.
Procedures with Respect to Qualified Performance-Based Awards
14.04       . Unless otherwise provided in the applicable agreement evidencing the Award, a Participant must
Payment of Qualified Performance-Based Awards
 
12
 
be employed by the Company or a subsidiary on the day a Qualified Performance-Based Award for such Performance Period is paid to the Participant. Furthermore, a Participant shall be eligible to receive payment pursuant to a Qualified Performance-Based Award for a Performance Period only if the Performance Goals for such period are achieved.
14.05       . Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, any Award granted to a Covered Employee that is intended to constitute a Qualified Performance-Based Award under this Section 14 shall be subject to any additional limitations set forth in section 162(m) of the Code (including any amendment to section 162(m) of the Code) or any regulations or rulings issued thereunder that are requirements for qualification as qualified performance-based compensation as described in section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code, and the Plan shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in the event of retireme nt at any age, any Performance-Based Awards shall vest based on performance to date.
Additional Limitations
14.06       . Nothing contained in the Plan will be deemed in any way to limit or restrict the Committee from making any award or payment to any person under any other plan, arrangement or understanding, whether now existing or hereafter in effect.
Effect on Other Plans and Arrangements
No Common Stock may be delivered upon the exercise of any Option until full payment has been made. A Participant has no rights whatsoever as a stockholder with respect to any shares covered by an Option until the date of the issuance of a stock certificate for the shares except as otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in the Agreement.
The Committee may, in its discretion and subject to such rules as it may adopt, permit or require a Participant to pay all or a portion of the federal, state and local taxes, including FICA and Medicare withholding tax, arising in connection with any Awards by (i) having the Company withhold shares of Common Stock at the minimum rate legally required, (ii) tendering back shares of Common Stock received in connection with such Award or (iii) delivering other previously acquired shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value approximately equal to the amount to be withheld.
Participation in the Plan will not give any Participant a right to be retained as an employee or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any right or claim to any benefit under the Plan, unless the right or claim has specifically accrued under the Plan.
The Board of Directors may from time to time amend or revise the terms of this Plan in whole or in part, subject to the following limitations:
 
13
 
An Option shall not be exercisable and a share of Common Stock shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an Option, and Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall not be awarded until and unless the Award of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such share pursuant thereto shall comply with all relevant provisions of law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any stock exchange or national securities association upon which the shares of Common Stock may then be listed or quoted, and shall be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. As a condition to the exercise of an Option, the Company may require the person exercising such Option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the shares of Common Stock are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned relevant provisions of law.
The Company, from time to time, also may substitute or assume outstanding awards granted by another company, whether in connection with an acquisition of such other company or otherwise, by either (a) granting an Award under the Plan in substitution of such other companys award, or (b) assuming such award as if it had been granted under the Plan if the terms of such assumed award could be applied to an Award granted under the Plan. Such substitution or assumption shall be permissible if the holder of the substituted or assumed award would have been eligible to be granted an Award under the Plan if the other company had applied the rules of the Plan to such grant. In the event the Company assumes an award granted by another company, the terms and conditions of such award shall remain unchanged (except that the exercise price and th e number and nature of shares issuable upon exercise of any such option will be adjusted appropriately pursuant to section 424(a) of the Code). In the event the Company elects to grant a new Award rather than assuming an existing option, such new Award may be granted with a similarly adjusted exercise price.
It is the intention of the Company that no Award shall be deferred compensation subject to section 409A of the Code, unless and to the extent that the Committee specifically determines otherwise, and the Plan and the terms and conditions of all Awards shall be interpreted accordingly. The terms and conditions governing any Awards that the Committee determines will be subject to section 409A of the Code, including any rules for elective or mandatory deferral of the delivery of cash or Shares pursuant thereto, shall be set forth in the applicable agreement governing the Award, and shall comply in all respects with section 409A of the Code.
 
14
 
granted to a Participant under this Plan shall be subject to the provisions of this Section unless there is an employment or other agreement in effect with the Participant governing clawbacks that applies to Awards under this Plan.
23.01       . This Plan is effective as of the date of its approval by the stockholders of the Company.
Effective Date
23.02       . The Plan will terminate 10 years after the date it is approved by the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may terminate the Plan at any time prior thereto with respect to any shares that are not then subject to Awards. Termination of the Plan will not affect the rights and obligations of any Participant with respect to Awards granted before termination.

1.             . The purpose of the AMCOL International Corporation 2010 Cash Incentive Plan (the Plan) is to provide performance-based incentive cash compensation to executive officers and other selected key employees of AMCOL International Corporation (the Company) and its subsidiaries, in order to promote the growth, performance and success of the Company.
Purpose
2.             .
Administration
2.1           . The Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee of the Companys board of directors (the Committee).
The Committee
2.2           . Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee, acting in its discretion, will have responsibility and authority to (a) select the individuals who may participate in the Plan, which individuals shall be executive officers or other key employees of the Company or its subsidiaries, (b) prescribe the terms and conditions of each participants award and make amendments thereto, (c) determine whether and the extent to which performance goals have been met, (d) construe, interpret and apply the provisions of the Plan and of any agreement or other document evidencing an award made under the Plan, and (e) make any and all determinations and take any and al l other actions as it deems necessary or desirable in order to carry out the terms of the Plan. The Committees interpretations of the Plan, and all actions taken and determinations made by the Committee pursuant to the powers vested in it hereunder, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties concerned, including the Company, its shareholders and any person granted an opportunity under the Plan.
Responsibility and Authority of the Committee
3.           .
Performance-Based Compensation Opportunities
3.1           . Each award made under the Plan will represent the right to receive incentive cash compensation upon the achievement of specific objective target performance goals that are established by the Committee in writing and communicated to the recipient of the award by the 90day of the applicable performance period or, if earlier, before 25% of the applicable performance period has elapsed. The Committee will determine the performance period applicable to an award. Subject to the requirements of the Plan and applicable law, each award will contain such other terms and conditions as the Committee, acting in its discretion, may prescribe.
General
th
3.2           . The amount, if any, payable to a participant with respect to an award will depend upon whether and the extent to which the performance goal(s) of the award are achieved during the applicable performance period. Performance goals may be established periodically and on a corporate-wide basis and/or with respect to operating units, divisions, subsidiaries, acquired businesses, minority investments, partnerships or joint ventures. The Committee may establish different levels of payment under an award to correspond with different levels of achievement of performance goals specified in the award. Awards may contain more than one target performance goal. Multiple performance goals contained in an award may be aggregated, weighted, expressed in the alternative or otherwise specified by the Committee. The level or levels of performance specified with respect to a performance goal may be expressed in absolute terms, as objectives relative to performance in prior periods, as an objective compared to the performance of one or more comparable companies or an index covering multiple companies, or otherwise as the Committee may determine. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, the performance goals under any award must be objective and must otherwise meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code).
Performance Goals
 
1
 
3.3           . Target performance goals may be based upon one or more objective business criteria that apply to the individual participant, one or more business units or subsidiaries or the Company as a whole. The business criteria shall be as follows, individually or in combination: (i) return on capital employed; (ii) earnings per share; (iii) net sales; (iv) net earnings; (v) operating profit; (vi) expense control; (vii) working capital relating to inventory and/or accounts receivable; (viii) operating margin; (ix) share price performance; (x) implementation or completion of critical projects; (xi) return on equity; (xii) return on assets; and (xiii) earnings before interest, t axes, depreciation and amortization. The Committee, in its discretion, may, within the time prescribed by Section 162(m) of the Code, adjust or modify the calculation of performance goals for a performance period in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of the rights of participants (i) in the event of, or in anticipation of, any unusual or extraordinary corporate item, transaction, event, or development, or (ii) in recognition of, or in anticipation of, any other unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company, or the financial statements of the Company, or in response to, or in anticipation of, changes in applicable laws, regulations, accounting principles, or business conditions.
Business Criteria for Performance Goals
3.4           . The Committee may reduce or eliminate an award made under the Plan for any reason, including, without limitation, changes in the position or duties of a participant during or after a performance period, whether due to termination of employment (including death, disability, retirement, voluntary termination or termination with or without cause) or otherwise.
Adjustments
3.5           . Following the completion of the performance period applicable to an award, the Committee shall determine and shall certify in writing whether and the extent to which the performance goal(s) under the award have been achieved, as well as the amount, if any, payable to the participant as a result of such achievement(s), which determination(s) and certification(s) shall be subject to and shall be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Certification
3.6           . Subject to such deferral and/or other conditions as may be permitted or required by the Committee, cash amounts earned under an award will be paid or distributed as soon as practicable following the Committees determination and certification of such amounts but in no event later than the 15day of the third month following the end of the Companys fiscal year during which the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code.
Payment of Amounts Earned
th
3.7           . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no individual may earn more than two million dollars ($2,000,000) in any calendar year pursuant to an award made to such individual under the Plan.
Maximum Annual Amount Payable to a Participant
3.8           . Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if permitted under Section 409A of the Code, in the event that all or a portion of an incentive award shall be ineligible for treatment as qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall have the right, with respect to any participant who is a covered employee under Section 162(m) of the Code, to defer, in whole or in part, such participants receipt of payment of his or her incentive award that the Company reasonably anticipates would not be deductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code until either (i) the Companys first f iscal year in which the Company reasonably anticipates, or should reasonably anticipate, that deductibility of the payment will not be limited by Section 162(m) of the Code, or (ii) the period beginning with the date of the participants separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) and ending on the later of the last day of the Companys fiscal year that includes the separation from service or the fifteenth day of the third month following the separation from service; provided that all other scheduled payments of deferred compensation (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) to the same participant that could be deferred in order to insure their deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code are also deferred.
Deferral
 
2
 
Where the payment is delayed to a date on or after the participants separation from service, the date that is six months after the separation from service of a participant shall be substituted for the date of the participants separation from service in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence if the participant is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code. No election may be provided a participant with respect to the timing of any payment that is delayed under this Section 3.8.
4.             . No interest in or under an award made or a payment due or to become due under the Plan may be assigned, transferred or otherwise alienated other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and any attempted assignment, alienation, sale, transfer, pledge, encumbrance, charge or other alienation of any such interest shall be void and unenforceable.
Non-transferability
5.             . No award and nothing contained in the Plan or in any document relating to the Plan shall confer upon an eligible employee or participant any right to continue as an employee of the Company or a subsidiary or constitute a contract or agreement of employment.
No Right to Continued Employment
6.             . The Company (or the relevant subsidiary or affiliate) shall have the right to deduct from all payouts of opportunities hereunder any federal, state, local or foreign taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to such payouts.
Withholding Taxes
7.             . The board of directors of the Company may amend the Plan at any time and from time to time. Any such amendment may be made without approval of the Companys shareholders unless and except to the extent such approval is required in order to satisfy the shareholder approval requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. The Companys board of directors may terminate the Plan at any time.
Amendment and Termination
8.             . The Plan shall be unfunded. The Company shall not be required to establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of assets to assure the payout of any award under the Plan.
Unfunded Plan
9.1           . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, all awards granted to a Participant under this Plan shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 9 unless there is an employment or other agreement in effect with the Participant governing clawbacks that applies to awards under this Plan.
General
9.2           . In the event of a restatement of the Companys previously issued financial statements, the Committee will review the circumstances regarding the restatement and all awards outstanding during any part of the time periods restated. If the Committee determines that a restatement is required due in whole or in part to the failure of a Participant to act reasonably and the Participant was paid or distributed an award that included within the applicable performance period any portion of the time periods restated, the Participant shall forfeit and repay to the Company any amounts paid or distributed in connection with such award in excess of what the Participant would have b een paid or distributed absent the restated financial statements.
Effect of Financial Restatement
10.1         . The Plan and any award made under the Plan shall be subject to and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and applicable federal law.
Governing Law
 
3
 
10.2         . It is intended that amounts payable pursuant to awards made under the Plan shall constitute qualified performance-based compensation and thus be exempt from the annual $1 million limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation. The Plan and each award made under the Plan will be interpreted, construed and applied accordingly.
Section 162(m) of the Code
10.3         . Subject to its approval by the shareholders, the Plan shall be effective as of January 1, 2010 and shall remain effective until the first annual meeting of shareholders in the 2015 fiscal year, subject to the right of the board of directors of the Company to terminate the Plan. Any award made under the Plan prior to approval of the shareholders shall be effective as of the date made (unless the Committee specifies otherwise at the time an award is made), but no award may be paid out prior to approval of the Plan by the shareholders. In addition, if the shareholders fail to approve the Plan, any award made under the Plan shall be cancelled. The performance criteria specified in the Plan shall be resubm itted for shareholder approval as and when required by Treasury Department regulations in order to ensure compliance with the shareholder approval requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code on an ongoing basis.

The Participant shall have none of the rights of a stockholder with respect to shares covered by such Options until the Participant becomes recordholder of such sha res.
Exercise
3.             . Nothing herein contained shall confer on the Participant any right with respect to continuation of employment by the Company or its subsidiaries, or interfere with the right of the Company or its subsidiaries to terminate at any time the employment of the Participant, or, except as the shares of Common Stock actually delivered, confer any rights as stockholder upon the holder hereof.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports Second Quarter Results
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - July 23, 2010) - AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) today reported 2010 second quarter net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders of $0.51 per diluted share as compared to $0.20 per diluted share in the prior year's period.
ACO
 
Net sales increased 28.9% to $220.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 from $171.2 million in the 2009 period. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 1.9% favorable impact on our sales results for the quarter. Operating profit increased 72.3% over the 2009 second quarter to $23.7 million. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 5.8% favorable impact on current period operating profit.
 
Net sales for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 increased 17.9% to $395.7 million, compared with $335.6 million for the 2009 period. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 2.8% favorable impact for the six-month period. Operating profit increased 44.1% over the 2009 period to $34.5 million. Foreign currency fluctuations had a 5.5% favorable impact on operating profit for the six-month period.
 
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included later in this press release.
 
"The solid second quarter revenue growth across all our major segments helped drive strong bottom line results," said Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. "The Minerals & Materials segment continued to perform well and we saw the seasonal improvement in our Environmental business following the difficult first quarter. Oilfield Services revenues were up nicely, and while its gross margins improved sequentially, we are still not back to last year's margin levels."
 
 
 
 
Washow continued, "The Minerals & Materials segment had another good quarter as the metalcasting markets are strong around the world. Our Asian business continues to grow as most countries in the region have rebounded from the economic slowdown. Much of our minerals business in Europe is consumer related so we have seen steady performance."
 
"Environmental activity has picked up substantially as better weather allowed the start of several delayed projects. Gross margins, however, are down from last year as revenues were comprised of more lining technology product sales. These markets are very competitive but our extensive global product and service base positions us well for a broad range of opportunities," Washow added.
 
"Oilfield Services activity did improve and we showed revenue growth over last year but margins were down as our businesses had some up front costs in anticipation of future growth and a different service mix. The hurricane season is here and the drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico could cause issues in the third quarter. We are still focused on expanding our business outside of the US but it will take some time to impact the performance," Washow continued.
 
"Overall it was a very good quarter. As long as the economic environment is favorable, we should see the solid results in our Minerals & Materials segment. The Environmental segment is strongest in the second and third quarters and we are involved in several new projects, but the global activity is still down from 2008 levels. With all the uncertainty Oilfield Services is the most difficult to forecast but the sequential improvement is encouraging. With a stable economic environment and strong balance sheet management, we are looking for top line growth in the remainder of 2010," Washow concluded.
 
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the segment results schedules included in this press release.
 
The following details the components of sales by segment for the 2010 second quarter as compared to the prior year's second quarter.
Net sales:
 
The majority of the revenue improvement was due to increased volumes, principally in domestic and Asian metalcasting markets resulting from increased demand for castings for automobiles and heavy equipment. Our basic minerals group had increased volumes driven by greater demand for drilling products for oil and gas wells.
Minerals & Materials:
 
 
 
 
The revenue increase is due to increased demand for our lining technology products in the US and Europe, and shipment of products that could not ship in the first quarter due to inclement weather conditions in the US and Europe. Favorable foreign currency fluctuations also benefited revenue growth in the quarter.
Environmental:
 
The majority of the increase is due to greater demand in domestic coiled tubing and Australia filtration services. Favorable foreign currency fluctuations also benefited revenue growth in the quarter.
Oilfield Services:
 
Approximately half of the revenue increase was due to higher fuel-surcharges and the remainder was from greater demand for consumer product shipments.
Transportation:
 
Gross profit increased $13.6 million, or 28.9%, from the 2009 second quarter while gross margin remained consistent with the prior year at 27.5%.
Gross profit:
 
Gross profit increased $12.4 million, or 83.3%, from the 2009 quarter, and gross margins increased 590 basis points to 25.7%, principally due to greater volumes and increased operating efficiencies.
Minerals & Materials:
 
Gross profit increased $0.6 million, or 3.0%, from the 2009 quarter. Gross margins decreased 440 basis points to 30.9%. The decrease in gross margin is principally due to increased competition in lining technology products.
Environmental:
 
: Gross profit increased $0.4 million, or 3.6% from the 2009 quarter. Gross margin decreased 570 basis points to 29.7% due to increased labor and expansion costs as well as changes in the composition of revenues by service offering.
Oilfield Services
 
GS&A expenses increased $3.7 million, or 11.0%, from the prior year quarter. Increased employee compensation and benefits expenses in Minerals & Materials and Corporate segments accounted for the majority of the increase. Approximately 14% of the increase was due to foreign currency fluctuations.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
 
Interest expense, net decreased $0.8 million due to lower average debt levels and reduced overall average interest rates.
Interest expense, net:
 
Other, net is comprised mostly of foreign currency transaction and currency derivative gains and losses. The $1.8 million improvement is due to reduced losses from foreign currency transactions.
Other, net:
 
 
 
 
The second quarter results include income tax expense of $5.5 million versus an expense of $1.5 million in the prior year period. The increased expense results from greater pre-tax income. The effective tax rate increased as a greater portion of pre-tax income was generated in our domestic operations, which typically are subject to higher tax rates than those in effect in foreign countries.
Income taxes:
 
The $1.7 million improvement over the prior year is due to improvements in the earnings of all affiliates and joint ventures, principally India, Belgium and Russia.
Income (loss) from affiliates and joint ventures:
 
Our weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased 1.7% to 31.5 million; this reduced diluted earnings per share attributable to AMCOL shareholders for the quarter by one penny per share.
Share count:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
Long-term debt increased $16.4 million to $223.4 million at June 30, 2010, compared to $207.0 million at December 31, 2009. The increase was primarily due to our greater working capital investments to support our revenue growth. Total long-term debt, net represented 37.0% of capitalization at June 30, 2010 as compared to 35.3% at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $10.6 million to $17.0 million at June 30, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009.
 
Net working capital increased $26.7 million from December 31, 2009 to $230.4 million at June 30, 2010. The increase in working capital was due to increased sales volumes.
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $6.9 million for year-to-date June 30, 2010 compared with $65.5 million in the prior year period. In 2009, we decreased our working capital levels significantly in response to the economic recession and lower sales volumes. Thus, we generated significantly less cash flows from operations in the 2010 period as working capital levels increased over the 2009 period due to the increase in sales volumes.
 
Excluding our corporate building, capital expenditures for year-to-date June 30, 2010 were $25.9 million, of which $13.4 million relates to our 2009 purchase of a chrome mine in South Africa and the construction of a related processing facility. Comparative amounts in the 2009 period were $32.4 million and $15.1 million, respectively.
 
 
 
 
Dividends through June 30, 2010 remained roughly the same over the prior year period as our dividend per share has remained constant at $0.18 per quarter per share since the third quarter of 2008.

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports Third Quarter Results
 
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - October 22, 2010) - AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) today reported 2010 third quarter net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders of $0.55 per diluted share as compared to $0.43 per diluted share in the prior year's period. The current period includes charges due to operational issues from our domestic personal care products group, within the Minerals & Materials segment of $.06 per diluted share, and a gain on foreign currency transactions of $.05 per diluted share.
ACO
 
Net sales increased 22.3% to $233.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 from $190.9 million in the 2009 period. Operating profit increased 17.1% over the 2009 third quarter to $22.5 million. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on our comparative results for the quarter.
 
Net sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 increased 19.5% to $629.1 million, compared with $526.5 million for the 2009 period. Operating profit increased 32.1% over the 2009 period to $57.0 million. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on our comparative results for the nine-month period.
 
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Further discussion of items and events impacting earnings are included later in this press release.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Overall, it was a good quarter, especially in our Minerals & Materials segment," said Larry Washow, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Environmental and Oilfield Services segments were generally in line with our expectations."
 
Washow continued, "The Minerals & Materials segment had another strong quarter as a stable US business combined with growth in Asia and solid results in Europe produced a good revenue number. The operational issues in domestic personal care products hurt our margins, however, we believe we have addressed these issues and do not expect similar charges going forward. Expected start-up losses from the South Africa chrome business also impacted margins in the quarter. Our other consumer related products are performing well and we have seen nice improvement in basic minerals. We believe we are well positioned across the segment with metalcasting continuing to show strength around the world."
 
"As expected, Environmental generated their highest quarterly revenue of the year. The margins were down as the business mix included more sales from contracting services, which tends to have lower margins. Building materials revenue is up somewhat from last year, but we still do not see significant improvement in the market," Washow continued.
 
"Oilfield Services revenue was up substantially from last year, and improved sequentially as well; nearly all of our business lines showed growth. Coil tubing sales in particular have been expanding and we look for it to perform well in the months ahead. We continue to improve our overseas service capability as we look for stronger growth prospects than those we see in the Gulf of Mexico," Washow added.
 
"The performance of the Minerals & Materials segment continues to be very encouraging and was a key contributor to the third quarter. Although the holidays will impact the fourth quarter, we expect continued margin improvement from Minerals & Materials into the fourth quarter. Activity in the Environmental segment is still soft, but we are seeing some larger projects develop and contracting services should continue to expand. Oilfield Services is also well positioned to wrap up a better year in revenue, and we are working to improve margins," Washow concluded.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the segment results schedules included in this press release.
 
The following discusses the reasons for the increased revenue by segment for the 2010 third quarter as compared to the prior year's quarter.
Net sales:
 
The majority of the revenue improvement was due to increased volumes, principally in domestic and Asian metalcasting markets, resulting from increased demand for castings for automobiles and heavy equipment. Our basic minerals group had increased volumes driven by greater demand for drilling products for oil and gas wells.
Minerals & Materials:
 
The revenue increase is principally due to increased demand for our European contracting services and our domestic building materials and drilling products.
Environmental:
 
The majority of the increase is due to greater demand for services from our domestic coiled tubing and Australian operations.
Oilfield Services:
 
Approximately one third of the revenue increase was due to increased fuel-surcharges and the remainder was from greater demand for consumer product shipments.
Transportation:
 
Gross profit increased $4.6 million, or 8.6%, from the 2009 third quarter, while gross margin decreased 310 basis points to 25.1%.
Gross profit:
 
Gross profit increased $4.2 million, or 21.0%, from the 2009 quarter, and gross margins decreased 50 basis points to 21.7%, principally due to the operational issues in domestic personal care products, and start-up losses in our South African chrome sand business, offset by greater volumes and increased operating efficiencies.
Minerals & Materials:
 
Gross profit decreased $1.9 million, or 8.5%, from the 2009 quarter. Gross margins decreased 650 basis points to 29.0%. The decrease in gross margin is principally due to an increase in sales in our lower margin contracting services and increased competition in lining technologies products.
Environmental:
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross profit increased $2.3 million, or 24.3% from the 2009 quarter. Gross margin decreased 400 basis points to 29.0% due to changes in the composition of revenues by service offering.
Oilfield Services:
 
GS&A expenses increased $1.3 million, or 3.9%, from the prior year quarter due to increased employee compensation and benefits costs.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
 
Interest expense, net, decreased $.3 million due to reduced overall average interest rates on average debt levels that were comparable to the prior year quarter.
Interest expense, net:
 
Other, net is comprised mostly of foreign currency transaction and currency derivative gains and losses. The $2.1 million increase is due to increased gains from foreign currency transactions.
Other, net:
 
The third quarter results include income tax expense of $5.2 million versus an expense of $3.3 million in the prior year period. The increased expense results from greater pre-tax income. The effective tax rate increased as a greater portion of pre-tax income was generated in our domestic operations, which typically are subject to higher tax rates than those in effect in foreign countries.
Income taxes:
 
The $0.4 million reduction from the prior year is due to lower earnings in our Indian and Russian joint ventures and affiliates.
Income (loss) from affiliates and joint ventures:
 
Our weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding increased 1.6% to 31.6 million; but did not have a material impact on our quarterly diluted earnings per share attributable to AMCOL shareholders.
Share count:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
Long-term debt increased $22.7 million to $229.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2010. During that time, we have invested in working capital to support our revenue growth, purchased the remaining 47% of the chrome mine in South Africa, and invested in a related chrome processing plant. Total long-term debt, net represented 36.1% of capitalization at September 30, 2010 as compared to 35.3% at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $7.3 million to $20.3 million at September 30, 2010 as compared to December 31, 2009.
 
Net working capital increased $35.1 million from December 31, 2009 to $238.8 million at September 30, 2010. The increase in working capital was due to increased sales volumes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $35.2 million for year-to-date September 30, 2010 compared with $90.6 million in the prior year period. Throughout 2009, we decreased our working capital levels significantly in response to the economic recession and lower sales volumes. Thus, we generated significantly less cash flows from operations in the 2010 period as working capital levels have increased since the prior year end due to the increase in sales volumes.
 
Capital expenditures for year-to-date September 30, 2010 were $37.9 million, of which $13.6 million relates to our construction of our chrome processing facility in South Africa. Excluding our corporate building, comparative amounts in the 2009 period were $39.6 million. The 2009 period also included $17.7 million of expenditures to purchase 53% of the aforementioned chrome mine and start constructing the related processing facility.
 
In September 2010, we purchased the remaining 47% of the noncontrolling South Africa chrome mine for $10.8 million, which is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement as purchase of noncontrolling interests.

In addition, all of Mr. Washows unvested stock options shall vest as of December 31, 2010 and the option exercise period will be extended to the earlier of the original expiration date or December 31, 2012.  In connection with these payments to be made to Mr. Washow and the vesting of his stock options following his retirement, the Company ex pects to record in the fourth quarter an estimated one-time pre-tax charge to earnings of approximately .

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports Fourth Quarter and 2010 Year End Results
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - January 28, 2011) - For the fourth quarter of 2010, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) reports a loss attributable to AMCOL shareholders of $0.30 per diluted share compared to earnings of $0.36 per diluted share in the 2009 period. However, these losses result largely from unusual items recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. Excluding these unusual items, we generated net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders of $0.21 per diluted share as compared to the prior year amount of $0.31 per diluted share, which has also been adjusted for unusual items.
ACO
 
Net sales increased 26.4% to $223.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, compared to $176.7 million for the 2009 period. Operating profit increased by 11.6% over the 2009 period to $11.5 million. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on our comparative results for the quarter.
 
The net loss in the current quarter includes non-cash losses from impairments associated with two of our joint ventures of $0.37 per diluted share, expenses of $0.05 per diluted share associated with the retirement of our previous CEO, expenses of $0.05 per diluted share resulting from operational issues in our domestic personal care products group within our Minerals & Materials segment, and tax expenses of $0.04 per diluted share associated with the recognition of valuation allowances in our foreign jurisdictions. The 2009 results include benefits of $0.05 per diluted share for resolution of certain income tax matters and a gain on the sale of a portion of our investment in Ashapura Minechem Limited.
 
For the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we generated net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders of $0.96 per diluted share compared to earnings of $1.12 per diluted share in the 2009 period. Net income attributable to AMCOL shareholders, adjusted for the unusual items mentioned above, was $1.57 per diluted share for the twelve months ending December 31, 2010 and $1.11 per diluted share for the comparable period ending December 31, 2009. The 2010 period includes the same adjustments for the same amounts as previously mentioned, except that the expenses associated with our personal care business totaled $0.15 per diluted share instead of the quarterly $0.05 per diluted share mentioned above. The 2009 period includes not only the related adjustments mentioned previously but also $0.04 of per diluted share of expenses associated with writing off certain metalcasting operations.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Net sales for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2010, increased 21.2% to $852.5 million, compared with $703.2 million for 2009. Operating profit increased 28.1% to $68.5 million compared to $53.5 million in the prior year period. Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on our comparative results for the twelve-month period.
 
"Excluding the negative impact from unusual items, our Minerals & Materials and Oilfield Services segments were generally in line with our expectations for the quarter," said Ryan McKendrick, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Environmental segment had a challenging quarter, and we have an action plan to improve its performance in 2011."
 
McKendrick continued, "The Minerals segment had another good quarter with increased revenue resulting from steady domestic and European business combined with continued growth in Asia. Gross margin was impacted by operational issues in our domestic personal care products group that continued into the fourth quarter. We do not expect significant additional costs going forward."
 
"The Environmental segment had a nice increase in revenue; however, margins were down as more of the sales mix was from lower margin contracting services. Building materials revenue and margins improved despite continued overall weakness in US non-residential construction. European sales remained steady but had lower margins due to mix, price pressure, and severe weather impacting construction activity. Expense control in this segment will be an area of increased focus going forward," McKendrick continued.
 
"Oilfield services continued to perform well with revenue and operating profit up nicely over the prior year's quarter and sequentially. Most business lines improved except for nitrogen services, which is most affected by the downturn in deep water drilling as a result of the Deepwater Horizon accident," McKendrick added.
 
"Looking forward, we expect market conditions for Minerals & Materials to remain favorable. A key driver for the segment is automobile and light truck production which is expected to increase in both North America and Asia, markets in which we are well positioned. We expect market conditions for basic minerals and specialty materials to continue to improve. The Environmental segment market conditions appear to be gaining some stability, and we expect to see improvements in this business as we implement plans to improve margins. Oilfield Services is well positioned, especially in North America, where producers continue to drill wells into oil and gas bearing shale formations," McKendrick concluded.
 
 
 
 
 
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release.
 
The following discusses the reasons for the increased revenue by segment for the 2010 fourth quarter as compared to the prior year's quarter.
Net sales:
 
The majority of the revenue improvement was due to increased volumes, principally in domestic and Asian metalcasting markets, resulting from increased demand for automobile and heavy equipment castings. The remainder of the increase results mostly from starting up our chrome operations in South Africa.
Minerals & Materials:
 
The revenue increase lies principally in our domestic contracting services and building materials and drilling products as the domestic construction market saw increases in demand.
Environmental:
 
The majority of the increase is due to greater demand for services from our domestic well testing and coiled tubing operations due to several large offshore jobs and growth in our onshore services in oil and gas bearing shale formations.
Oilfield Services:
 
Approximately half of the revenue increase was due to increased fuel-surcharges and the remainder was from greater demand for consumer product shipments.
Transportation:
 
Gross profit increased $9.1 million, or 20.6%, from the 2009 fourth quarter, while gross margin decreased 120 basis points to 23.7%.
Gross profit:
 
Gross profit increased $2.7 million, or 13.2% from the 2009 quarter, due to increased sales partly offset by the increased expenses from operational issues within our personal care business, which was the largest cause of the 230 basis point decrease in gross margins.
Minerals & Materials:
 
Gross profit increased $0.2 million, or 1.2%, from the 2009 quarter. Gross margins decreased 300 basis points to 28.3%. The decrease in gross margin is principally due to a greater portion of sales being derived from our lower margin contracting services business in addition to increased competition in lining technologies products.
Environmental:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross profit almost doubled to $12.2 million over the 2009 quarter. Gross margin increased 500 basis points to 28.0% due to greater operating leverage given the increase in revenues without significant increases in fixed costs.
Oilfield Services:
 
GS&A expenses increased $7.9 million, or 23.3%, from the prior year quarter. Approximately $2.7 million of this relates to expenses for the retirement of our former CEO; the remainder mostly relates to increased employee and employee related costs as well as operating costs for new offices that were not established in the prior year.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
 
Other, net expenses increased $2.5 million due mostly to increased losses from foreign currency transactions and foreign currency derivatives.
Other, net:
 
The fourth quarter results include income tax expense of $5.8 million versus a benefit of $0.9 million in the prior year period. Several factors contributed to this increase. The prior year period reflects a large benefit to tax expense associated with the settlement of domestic audits for the 2005 and 2007 periods as well as an increased benefit from foreign operations, which are typically subject to lower tax rates than our domestic operations. Our current period effective tax rate is negatively affected by changes in geographical earnings distribution estimates and the recognition of valuation allowances against net operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions.
Income taxes:
 
Our joint-ventures resulted in $11.5 million of losses in the quarter versus income of $1.0 million in the prior year. The losses in 2010 result largely from impairment charges related to our Russian and Belgian joint-ventures; both of these investments have been fully written off. We do not expect to record income from these investments in the near future.
Income (loss) from affiliates and joint ventures:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
Long-term debt increased $29.2 million to $236.2 million during our 2010 fiscal year. During that time, we have invested in working capital to support our revenue growth, purchased the remaining 47% of the chrome mine in South Africa, and invested in a related chrome processing plant. Total long-term debt, net represented 37.1% of capitalization at December 31, 2010 as compared to 35.3% at December 31, 2009. Cash and cash equivalents are approximately the same between these two dates.
 
Net working capital increased $45.4 million during the year to $249.1 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in working capital was due to increased sales volumes.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $48.1 million for our 2010 fiscal year as compared to $122.4 million in the prior year. Throughout 2009, we decreased our working capital levels significantly as a result of the economic recession and lower sales volumes. Thus, we generated significantly less cash flows from operations in the 2010 period as working capital levels have increased since the prior year end due to the increase in sales volumes.
 
Capital expenditures for year-to-date December 31, 2010 were $47.3 million, of which $14.9 million relates to our construction of our chrome processing facility in South Africa. Excluding our corporate building, comparative amounts in the 2009 period were $50.8 million, which includes $22.6 million of expenditures to purchase 53% of the chrome mine and start constructing the related processing facility.
 
Dividends through December 31, 2010 remained roughly the same over the prior year period as our dividend per share has remained constant at $0.18 per quarter per share.
 
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited, condensed, consolidated financial statements. In addition, this release reports diluted earnings per share which have been adjusted to exclude certain unusual items. We believe this non-GAAP financial statistic is a better measure of the earnings we generated as well as being more comparable to prior periods.

On February 8, 2011, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of AMCOL International Corporation (AMCOL) authorized awards of performance-based restricted stock (RSAs) and stock options to AMCOLs executive officers under AMCOLs 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan.  A description of the material terms and conditions of these awards is set forth below.  These descriptions are qualified by reference to the full text of the Performance Based Restricted Stock Form Award Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and the Form of Option Award Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.3 to AMCOLs Current Report on Form 8-K filed on May 7, 2010.
 
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards
 
Set forth below is a table outlining the number of RSAs awarded to our executive officers.  The number of RSAs that will vest depends on AMCOLs return on capital employed in fiscal 2011, 2012 and 2013.  In addition, for Mr. Pearson, the number of RSAs that will vest depends on the cost of capital in fiscal 2011, 2012 and 2013.  In the event of a Change of Control, all unvested RSAs will immediately vest.  Dividends will not be paid on the RSAs until the shares have vested.  At such time as the RSA vests, the executive is entitled to a payment based on the dividends declared during the restricted period and the number of shares earned.
 
 
Stock Option Awards
 
Set forth below is a table outlining the number of options awarded to our executive officers.  These options have a ten-year term and will vest 33.3% each year over a three-year period.  Once vested, the options are exercisable at $30.66, the closing price of our common stock on the award date.

Change of Control Agreements  Effective June 2011
 
On March 11, 2011, AMCOL International Corporation (AMCOL), entered into Change of Control Agreements with Ryan F. McKendrick (President and Chief Executive Officer), Gary L. Castagna (Senior Vice President and President, Global Minerals), Michael Johnson (Vice President and President of CETCO Oilfield Services Company), Donald W. Pearson (Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer) and Robert Trauger (Vice President and President of CETCO).  These agreements are effective on June 11, 2011 and terminate on June 11, 2014.
If within 120 days prior to, or twelve months following, a change of control, AMCOL terminates an executive without cause or the executive terminates his employment for good reason,  the executive is entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to three times (in the case of Mr. McKendrick) or two times (in the case of Messrs. Castagna, Johnson, Pearson and Trauger) the sum of his salary and target bonus.  If a change of control occurs, the executive will be paid a prorated portion of his performance-based annual bonus and all outstanding stock options, restricted stock and other equity compensation awards become fully vested and exercisable unless otherwise required under Internal Revenue Code section 162(m).
 
A change of control of AMCOL is defined as one or more of the following, subject to certain exemptions:  (1) any person (other than certain AMCOL affiliates) acquires 50.1% or more of AMCOLs common stock; (2) the AMCOL directors serving as of the end of the prior fiscal year cease to constitute at least one-half of AMCOLs directors; or (3) the consummation by AMCOL of a merger, reorganization, consolidation, or similar transaction, or sale or other disposition of 50.1% of the consolidated assets of AMCOL.  In addition, for Messrs. Castagna,  Johnson and Trauger, a change of control will be deemed to have occurred if AMCOL sells a majority of the stock or assets of the Minerals and Materials segment, Oilfield Services segment or Environmental segment, respectively, and the respective officer oversees the operation of such segment.
 
The Change of Control Agreements incorporate by reference the confidentiality and non-compete provisions of previously executed Confidentiality Agreements and Covenants Not to Compete which  contain confidentiality and one year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in favor of AMCOL.
 
Good reason is defined, subject to notice requirements and an opportunity for AMCOL to remedy the condition, as the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) any material reduction in executives duties and responsibilities; (2) any material reduction in executives base salary, target bonus opportunity or equity compensation; or (3) any relocation of executive without consent to a facility more than fifty miles away.  Cause is defined as the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) executives commission of a felony or misdemeanor that involves fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude; (2) subject to a notice and cure provision, executives material breach of the Change of Control Agreement or Confidentiality Agreement and Covenant Not to Compete; (3) willful or intentional material misconduct by executive in the
performance of his duties; (4) executive performs his duties in a manner that is grossly negligent; and/or (5) executive fails to cooperate in any governmental investigations or proceedings.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Executive Severance Plan  Effective June 2011
 
In March 2011, AMCOLs Compensation Committee adopted the AMCOL International Corporation Executive Severance Plan, effective on June 11, 2011.  The Compensation Committee can terminate or amend the Executive Severance Plan at any time.  Any such termination shall not effect those employees previously terminated and receiving payments.  Each of Messrs. Castagna, Johnson, McKendrick, Pearson and Trauger will participate in the Executive Severance Plan.
 
Pursuant to the Executive Severance Plan, if an executive is involuntarily terminated in certain circumstances, AMCOL will provide for base salary for twenty-four months (in the case of Mr. McKendrick) or for eighteen months (in the case of Messrs. Castagna, Johnson, Pearson and Trauger), as well as payment of the executives COBRA premium for a period of 18 months.  No such amounts will be paid under the Executive Severance Plan if the executive is entitled to any severance benefits pursuant to a Change of Control Agreement.
 
The descriptions of the Change of Control Agreements and the Executive Severance Plan set forth above are qualified by reference to the full text of such agreements and plan attached hereto as exhibits and incorporated herein by reference,
 
Item 1.02                      Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.

(i)
   
.  An operating business segment (other than the transportation segment) shall be considered a segment for purposes of this Section 3(e) if the Company classifies it as a segment in its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the sale.

.  For purposes of calculating the cash award under Section 3(a)(i)(B), the target bonus amount for Executive under the Companys annual bonus program with respect to the year immediately preceding thesale of the segment (or the year immediately preceding the termination of employment, if earlier), will be used instead of the target bonus amount with respect to the year of sale of the segment.

(b)           .  If a Change of Control occurs during the term of this Agreement (including the sale of a segment as provided under Section 3(e) above), the Company shall provide Executive with a payment equal to a prorated portion of his performance-based annual bonus for such year.

(iii)
   
For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executives right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each such installment payment shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.

.  An operating business segment (other than the transportation segment) shall be considered a segment for purposes of this Section 3(e) if the Company classifies it as a segment in its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the sale.

(b)           .  If a Change of Control occurs during the term of this Agreement (including the sale of a segment as provided under Section 3(e) above), the Company shall provide Executive with a payment equal to a prorated portion of his performance-based annual bonus for such year.

Code Section 409A
 
(i)
   
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no amount deemed deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be payable to Executive hereunder unless Executives termination of employment constitutes a separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder.  In addition, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executives separation from service to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Executives benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executives separation from service with the Company (as such term is defined in the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code) or (ii) the date of Executives death.

(iii)
   
For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executives right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each such installment payment shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.

Code Section 409A
 
(i)
   
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no amount deemed deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be payable to Executive hereunder unless Executives termination of employment constitutes a separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder.  In addition, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executives separation from service to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Executives benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executives separation from service with the Company (as such term is defined in the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code) or (ii) the date of Executives death.

(iii)
   
For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executives right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each such installment payment shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.

Code Section 409A
 
(i)
   
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no amount deemed deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be payable to Executive hereunder unless Executives termination of employment constitutes a separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder.  In addition, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executives separation from service to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Executives benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executives separation from service with the Company (as such term is defined in the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code) or (ii) the date of Executives death.  Upon the first business day following the expiration of the applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this Section shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive, and any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein.  Finally, to the extent that any reimbursements payable pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid to Executive no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred, the amount of expenses reimbursed in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement in any subsequent year, and Executives right to reimbursement under this Agreement will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
 
(ii)
   
Additionally, in the event that following the date hereof the Company or Executive reasonably determines that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company and Executive shall work together to adopt such amendments to this Agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits provided with respect to this Agreement or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision will be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code.
 
 
 
 
 
(iii)
   
For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executives right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each such installment payment shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.
 
(iv)
   
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to the extent any expense reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit under this Agreement is determined to be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the amount of any such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit, in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses), in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive incurred such expenses, and in no event shall any right to reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

Exhibit 10.5
 
 
This Change of Control Agreement (the Agreement) is made and entered into as of March 11, 2011 by and between Robert Trauger (the Executive) and AMCOL International Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company).
 
WHEREAS, it is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control transaction.

WHEREAS, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide Executive with an incentive to continue Executives employment and to motivate Executive to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
 
WHEREAS, the Board believes that it is imperative to provide Executive with severance benefits upon Executives termination of employment in connection with a Change of Control to provide enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to Executive to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.

.  An operating business segment (other than the transportation segment) shall be considered a segment for purposes of this Section 3(e) if the Company classifies it as a segment in its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the sale.

For purposes of calculating the cash award under Section 3(a)(i)(B), the target bonus amount for Executive under the Companys annual bonus program with respect to the year immediately preceding thesale of the segment (or the year immediately preceding the termination of employment, if earlier), will be used instead of the target bonus amount with respect to the year of sale of the segment.

Code Section 409A
 
(i)
   
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no amount deemed deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be payable to Executive hereunder unless Executives termination of employment constitutes a separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder.  In addition, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executives separation from service to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Executives benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executives separation from service with the Company (as such term is defined in the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code) or (ii) the date of Executives death.  Upon the first business day following the expiration of the applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) period, all payments deferred pursuant to this Section shall be paid in a lump sum to Executive, and any remaining payments due under this Agreement shall be paid as otherwise provided herein.  Finally, to the extent that any reimbursements payable pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code, any such reimbursements payable to Executive pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid to Executive no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred, the amount of expenses reimbursed in one year shall not affect the amount eligible for reimbursement in any subsequent year, and Executives right to reimbursement under this Agreement will not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.
 
(ii)
   
Additionally, in the event that following the date hereof the Company or Executive reasonably determines that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company and Executive shall work together to adopt such amendments to this Agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits provided with respect to this Agreement or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision will be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code.
 
 
 
 
 
(iii)
   
For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executives right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each such installment payment shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.
 
(iv)
   
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to the extent any expense reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit under this Agreement is determined to be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the amount of any such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit, in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses), in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive incurred such expenses, and in no event shall any right to reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

ITEM 2.02                      RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
The information in this item is being furnished to, but not filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission solely under Item 12 of Form 8-K, Results of Operations and Financial Condition, pursuant to interim procedures promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Release 33-8216 issued March 27, 2003.
On April 26, 2011, the registrant issued a press release to report results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2011.
That press release dated, April 26, 2011 and titled AMCOL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (NYSE:ACO) NEARLY DOUBLES ITS FIRST QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01                      Financial Statements and Exhibits
(d)           The following exhibit is furnished with this document:

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Nearly Doubles Its First Quarter Diluted Earnings per Share
 
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - April 26, 2011) - For the first quarter of 2011, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) nearly doubled its diluted earnings per share attributable to its shareholders to $0.38 per share versus $0.20 per share in the prior year's quarter.
ACO
 
Net sales increased 27.1% to $222.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2011, compared to $175.0 million for the 2010 period. Operating profit increased 72.6% over the 2010 period to $18.6 million, while operating profit margins increased 210 basis points. Nearly all of the growth in operating profit was derived organically, as acquisitions and foreign currency translation had a negligible impact. Income from our affiliates and joint ventures comprised approximately $0.03 of the $0.18 increase in diluted earnings per share.
 
"We were generally pleased with our results for the quarter as our three largest business segments exceeded expectations," said Ryan McKendrick, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Minerals & Materials segment continued its revenue growth driven by a strong automotive market in both Asia and North America. Gross margin improvement in key business units within the segment was partially offset by low margins from our new chromite business, where we are continuing to improve production throughput and reduce yield loss."
 
"The Environmental segment increased revenues with gross margins trending in the right direction. As the construction season gets into full swing, we expect improvement from our domestic contracting services group. This should be accompanied by enhanced margins in our lining technologies business, which has a backlog with a more favorable product mix," McKendrick added.
 
McKendrick continued, "Oilfield Services also had a strong quarter as our customers continue to increase demand for services associated with drilling and production in oil and gas bearing shale formations. Well testing and coiled tubing services are the strongest in demand. However, the continued slowdown in deep water permitting activity continues to negatively affect demand for some of our filtration services utilized on deep water well completions."
 
 
 
 
 
 
"The outlook for the major business units within each segment appears favorable. We expect our Minerals & Materials segment, which is positioned well in the North American and Asian automotive markets, to benefit from growth within this sector. Oilfield Services should continue to expand its global footprint into areas where exploration and production activity is strong. The markets served by the Environmental segment appear to be gaining some momentum, and we are expecting continued improvement in this business segment," he concluded.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release.
 
The following discusses the reasons for the increased revenue by segment for the 2011 first quarter as compared to the prior year's quarter.
Net sales:
 
The majority of the revenue improvement was due to increased volumes, principally in our domestic and Asian metalcasting markets, and our relatively new chromite ore product offerings. All three markets continue to experience an increase in demand for automobile and heavy equipment castings. Sales of our chromite products were minimal in the first quarter of 2010.
Minerals & Materials:
 
This segment continues to see an increase in demand that is more pronounced given the depressed economic environment that existed during the first quarter of 2010. The increase in revenues is derived from both our domestic and European markets, especially in our lining technologies and contracting services product lines -- two areas which were more affected during the recent recession.
Environmental:
 
As was the case with its 2010 fourth quarter results, the majority of the revenue increase in this segment was due to greater demand for our domestic well testing and coiled tubing services due to several large offshore jobs and growth in our onshore services in oil and gas bearing shale formations.
Oilfield Services:
 
Nearly all of the revenue increase was due to increased fuel-surcharges.
Transportation:
 
Gross profit increased $13.6 million, or 30.5%, from the 2010 first quarter. Gross margins also improved slightly.
Gross profit:
 
Gross profit increased $4.3 million, or 17.6% from the 2010 quarter due to domestic price increases and profit and operational improvements across all markets and geographic regions. Our margins suffered slightly, however, as a greater portion of sales were derived from our chromite operations. We continue to focus on improving our chromite operations, which began late in the second quarter of 2010.
Minerals & Materials:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross profit increased $5.1 million, or 46.0%, from the 2010 quarter. The increase in gross profit was derived largely from the increased sales levels as previously mentioned. These increases yielded slight gross margin benefits which were tempered by raw material price increases in our Asian market.
Environmental:
 
Gross profit increased 58.0%, or $4.7 million, over the 2010 quarter. Gross margins improved 180 basis points due to lower variable cost structures in the service lines experiencing the revenue increases as well as overall increased pricing due to greater demand for our services.
Oilfield Services:
 
GS&A expenses increased $5.8 million, or 17.1%, from the prior year quarter. The majority of the increase stems from greater employee compensation costs, expenses associated with increased information technology investments, and costs associated with realigning the cost structure of our environmental segment with the goal of reducing ongoing expenses in the future.
General, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A):
 
Our affiliates and joint ventures generated $1.1 million of income in the 2011 first quarter as compared to a loss of $0.1 million in the prior year's quarter. In the first quarter of 2010, our Russian and Belgian joint-ventures generated significant losses which were accompanied by less than expected results from our other joint-ventures given the global recession occurring during that time period. In the first quarter of 2011, we did not record losses from our Russian or Belgian joint-ventures as these investments are now held at a zero costs basis in our balance sheet. In addition, our 50% owned Japanese and Indian joint-ventures reported strong earnings in the 2011 quarter due to recovery in the economies in which they operate.
Income (loss) from affiliates and joint ventures:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
Long-term debt decreased slightly to $232.4 million since our prior year-end, and we reduced our cash balance by $6.1 million to $21.2 million during that time. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 36.5% at March 31, 2011 as compared to 37.1% at December 31, 2010. Since the prior year-end, we have increased our non-cash working capital by $8.4 million, or 3.8%, due to the overall greater level of activity and sales occurring in the first quarter of 2011.
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $10.3 million for our 2011 first quarter as compared to $8.6 million in the prior year period. The increase results from greater income, somewhat reduced by increased working capital levels required to support the revenue growth.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2011 were $10.4 million as compared to $16.1 million in the prior year's period, which included $11.1 million of capital expenditures associated with building our chrome plant in South Africa. Capital expenditures associated with this plant were $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. In the first quarter 2011, a majority of our capital spending occurred in our Oilfield Services segment to fund anticipated revenue growth in our coil tubing and well testing services, especially those provided in oil and gas bearing shale formations.
 
Dividends through March 31, 2011 remained roughly the same over the prior year period as our dividend per share has remained constant at $0.18 per quarter per share.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports Second Quarter Results
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - July 22, 2011) - For the second quarter of 2011, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) generated diluted earnings per share attributable to its shareholders of $0.43 per share versus $0.51 per share in the prior year's quarter.
ACO
 
Net sales increased 13.6% to $250.8 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, as compared to $220.7 million for the 2010 period. Gross profits increased 3.3% while gross margins decreased from 27.5% to 25.0%. Operating profit decreased 6.8% to $22.1 million. The increase in our effective tax rate from 25.4% in the second quarter of 2010 to 30.1% in the 2011 quarter comprised $0.03 of the $0.08 decrease in diluted earnings per share attributable to our shareholders.
 
Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates accounted for 24.5% of the increase in sales, and helped offset more than one third of the organic decrease in operating profits. During the current quarter, our start-up chrome sand operations experienced net losses of $0.03 per diluted share. For the remainder of fiscal 2011, we expect our chrome sand operations to generate net losses of between $0.08 to $0.12 per diluted share; this excludes an estimated $0.05 per diluted share benefit resulting from a contingent gain we will record in Q3 associated with our chrome sand mining costs.
 
"Although sales for the quarter were in line with our expectations, our gross margins deteriorated in each of our three major business segments and led to our disappointing earnings in Q2," said Ryan McKendrick, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
"The Minerals and Materials segment experienced good revenue growth. But gross margins decreased in our chrome sand business, our Asia operations, and our domestic operations, all of which contributed to the 3.2 percentage point decrease in margins for the segment as compared to Q2 2010. Our domestic operations experienced production cost increases, mostly related to fuel and labor costs. Our chrome sand business will continue to present challenges for the balance of the year as we upgrade our plant to improve throughput and product yields. Rapidly rising costs in Asia have not yet been fully offset by price increases, especially in Thailand and South Korea where margins have dropped by almost four percentage points as compared to the prior year's quarter. Our pet products business has been negatively impacted by reduced demand for both bulk as well as packaged products from large private label customers.

Our domestic metalcasting business -- our largest business unit -- continues to perform well, maintaining gross margins despite rising costs," continued McKendrick.
 
"The Environmental segment generated 25% sales growth over Q2 2010. We were disappointed in the more than 3 percentage point decrease in gross margins as compared to the prior year's quarter though. We experienced cost increases in Europe and are implementing plans to increase our margins in this geographic market. Although our U.S. based contracting services business had strong sales growth, the business overall continues to generate less than desired gross profits. Controlling SG&A costs remains an area of focus in this segment overall," McKendrick added.
 
McKendrick continued, "The Oilfield Services segment also experienced revenue growth consistent with our expectations. Its sales mix, however, negatively impacted gross margins. Revenues from high margin, offshore services in the Gulf of Mexico ('GOM'), including our flagship filtration services, decreased as compared to the prior year's quarter, leading to an overall 4.1 percentage point decrease in gross margins for the segment. We see no indication that deep water activity will increase in the GOM over the next couple of quarters."
 
"The outlook for many of the major business units within our segments remains positive, but several areas will continue to present challenges. Demand in our metalcasting markets is expected to remain strong in the U.S. and Asia due to strong automotive and heavy equipment production. Our Building Materials group within the Environmental segment is continuing profitable growth despite relatively soft market conditions for non-residential construction primarily due to successful new product introductions. However, competition in the Lining Technologies area is limiting our ability to improve margin through pricing. Although our Oilfield Services' gross margins will continue to be impacted by the decline in deep water activity in the GOM, we are working hard to improve margins in other service offerings within this segment. Gross margin improvement will be the area of strong focus across all segments," he concluded.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release. The following comments relate to our results for the current quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2010, unless otherwise noted.
 
Net sales increased $30.1 million or 13.6%.
Net sales:
 
: The majority of the revenue improvement was due to increased volumes, principally in our domestic and Asian metalcasting markets, and our relatively new chrome sand product offerings. These markets continue to experience an increase in demand for automobile and heavy equipment castings. In addition, approximately 22%
Minerals & Materials
 
 
 
 
 
AMCOL International Corporation

of the increase in net sales was driven by favorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates.
 
: This segment continues to see an increase in demand that is more pronounced given the depressed economic environment that existed during the prior year's period. The total increase in revenues was $16.1 million, or 24.6%. Approximately 80.2% of the increase in this segment's sales is attributable to organic growth with the remainder related to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase occurred mostly in our domestic contracting services business and our European operations. Our domestic contracting services' prior year's results were heavily affected by the recession underway at that time, making comparisons to that period somewhat irrelevant for this business. Our European business continues to grow organically due to growing economies in Eastern Europe, new sales representation in certain geographic markets, and increased contracting services revenues.
Environmental
 
: The growth in revenues occurred primarily in our domestic businesses as several of our businesses, especially our coil tubing services, continue to benefit from increased demand in the Texas shale regions. Our pipeline services also experienced increased demand as high oil prices increase our customers' maintenance needs. Our domestic filtration revenues suffered significantly this quarter due to depressed offshore activity resulting from the low amount of drilling permits being issued in the GOM. Regarding our foreign operations, revenues in Australia decreased (due to a large customer contract that ended in Q3 2010) while all other foreign businesses experienced revenue growth.
Oilfield Services
 
: Nearly all of the revenue increase was due to increased fuel-surcharges. This segment continues to see an increase in services being provided to divisions with our other subsidiaries, principally our metalcasting and pet products groups; these intercompany revenues are eliminated in the corporate segment.
Transportation
 
Gross profit increased $2.0 million, or 3.3%. Gross margins, however, decreased across all segments as discussed below.
Gross profit:
 
: Gross profit decreased slightly but gross margins decreased 320 basis points to 22.5%. The decreased margins occurred in Asia and our domestic business, which experienced increased manufacturing costs, and in our start-up chrome sand operations in South Africa. We continue to focus on improving our chrome sand operations, which began late in the second quarter of 2010.
Minerals & Materials
 
: Gross profit increased $2.5 million, or 12.2%, from the 2010 quarter. The increase in gross profit was derived largely from the increased sales levels as previously mentioned. Gross margins, however, decreased 310 basis points to 27.8%. The decrease in margins occurred due to a change in product mix as well as increased production costs and raw material costs.
Environmental

Page 4 of 12
 
: Gross profit decreased due to the 410 basis point decrease in gross margins derived from a change in our sales mix. Although revenues increased, the increases were concentrated in onshore as opposed to offshore work. This shift decreased profitability as offshore work is more profitable. Gross margins in our international business also decreased due to the completion of a large job in Australia in Q3 2010.
Oilfield Services
 
The 9.8% increase in SG&A expenses was driven mostly by increases in our Minerals & Materials and Environmental segments with 28.6% of the increase arising from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The organic increase resulted primarily from increased employee and employee related expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A):
 
Our income tax expense increased due to an increase in our effective tax rate, which increased due to our expectation that our foreign operations will generate less of our total 2011 pre-tax income than previously anticipated.
Income tax expense:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
Long-term debt increased slightly to $240.5 million since our prior year-end, and we reduced our cash balance by $9.3 million to $17.9 million during that time. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 36.7% at June 30, 2011 as compared to 37.1% at December 31, 2010. Since the prior year-end, we have increased our non-cash working capital by $30.7 million due to growth we've had in 2011.
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $13.8 million through the first six months of 2011 as compared to $6.9 million in the prior year period. The increase results from greater income and non-cash charges.
 
Capital expenditures for the six months ending June 30, 2011 were $24.8 million as compared to $25.9 million in the prior year's period. In each of these periods, expenditures associated with our start-up chrome sand operations were $2.8 million and $13.4 million, respectively. In the six months ending June 30, 2011, the majority of our capital spending occurred in our Oilfield Services segment and our Minerals and Materials segment.
 
Dividends through June 30, 2011 remained roughly the same over the prior year period as our dividend per share has remained constant at $0.18 per quarter per share.

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports Third Quarter Results
 
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - October 28, 2011) - For the third quarter of 2011, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) generated diluted earnings per share attributable to its shareholders from continuing operations of $0.63 per share versus $0.55 per share in the prior year's quarter. Net income was $0.60 per diluted share for the quarter, reflective of the sale of our domestic contracting services business in the third quarter of 2011.
ACO
 
Net sales increased 8.4% to $248.0 million for the 2011 third quarter, as compared to $228.8 million for the 2010 period. Gross profits increased 21.8% while gross margins increased 310 basis points to 28.6%. Our gross profit in the third quarter of 2011 includes $1.5 million ($0.05 per share) of one-time reductions of our chromite mining costs. Operating profit increased 19.3% with operating margins increasing by 100 basis points to 10.9%. The aforementioned reduction in mining costs accounted for 60 basis points of the increase.
 
In the prior year's results, Other income, net included gains of $0.05 per share whereas this quarter's amount is minimal. The difference results from foreign currency management programs which have reduced the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the current quarter. Our effective tax rate increased in the quarter as compared to the prior year's quarter due to differences in non-recurring, discrete items between the two periods. Our income from joint-ventures and affiliates includes income of $0.07 per share associated with the sale of our ownership interest in our Belgian joint-venture.
 
During the current quarter, our start-up chromite operations generated earnings of $0.08 per share, inclusive of the $0.05 per share benefit previously mentioned. For the remainder of fiscal 2011, we expect our chromite operations to generate less than $0.02 per share of net income for AMCOL shareholders.
 
"Sales for the quarter were generally in line with our expectations, and we were pleased with the improvement in gross margin for all business segments -- the key factor leading to improved earnings for the quarter," said Ryan McKendrick, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Our Minerals and Materials segment generated 12% revenue growth versus prior year Q3 with significant gross margin improvement both sequentially and in comparison to the prior year's period. Both domestic and Asian metalcasting businesses experienced top line growth while maintaining gross margins. In addition, the turn-around in our personal care products business unit, which incurred a substantial loss in the 2010 period, was a factor in the overall improvement in gross margin. Our chromite business also contributed nicely in the quarter both in top line sales as well as profit contribution -- exceeding our expectations. The improved results for chromite were a result of our ability to selectively mine chromite ore that is more consistent with our original quality expectations and is thus more suitable to the existing manufacturing process. We are proceeding with the planned improvements to our manufacturing process to accommodate varying chromite ore quality likely to be encountered in the future. This will result in some down time in the near-term and affect the short-term profitability of our chromite business," continued McKendrick.
 
"The Environmental segment generated a small sales increase over Q3 2010, as increases in building materials and drilling products business were somewhat offset by a decline in lining technologies sales. Gross margin of 31% for the segment improved both sequentially as well as compared to Q3 2010. The building materials group continues to perform well based on new product introductions and a strong market position in several areas where construction activity is relatively stable. Price increases in the domestic lining technologies market have started to show some positive effect -- their gross margins have improved both sequentially and versus Q3 2010. However, the improvement in domestic margin was partially offset by lower margins in Europe. Our European contracting business also incurred a bad debt expense of approximately $1.1 million for the quarter associated with insolvency of a general contractor for whom we were performing work. In the US, we have exited the contracting business," McKendrick added.
 
McKendrick continued, "Our Oilfield Services segment experienced a 21.8% increase in sales revenue as compared to Q3 2010, with gross margin exceeding 30% for the quarter -- a 5 percentage point sequential margin improvement. Coiled tubing services, largely associated with hydraulic fracturing in various shale formations, was a large contributor to the growth. Our Pipeline Services business is also becoming an important contributor to the product mix, and accounted for 22% of the growth in the segment as compared to Q3 2010. This service focuses on pipeline maintenance and integrity testing utilizing our specialized technology designed to handle high volumes of solids discharged from pipelines during cleaning operations."
 
"The outlook for our major business units remains largely positive. Metalcasting is expected to remain stable as demand for automobiles, agricultural equipment, and machinery drives demand for castings. Demand for our pet products is expected to strengthen as consumers shift their preferences to private label brands supplied by major retailers. Despite the low level of non-residential construction activity, we expect our building materials group to continue performing well based on a broad portfolio of new products. Although the market for lining technologies is under pressure, we are improving margins and maintaining a strong position in the market. In Oilfield Services, we are positioned well to participate in the fast growing hydraulic fracturing segment, while continuing to develop and deploy specialized technologies for pipeline services and water treatment. Our major customers are expecting deep water drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico to increase in 2012 as permitting requirements become better defined. This should translate into an increase in activity for our filtration services as we move into 2012. In summary, we will continue to focus on positioning AMCOL to succeed within business segments that we know well," he concluded.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release. The following comments relate to our results for the current quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
 
Net sales increased $19.2 million or 8.4%.
Net sales:
 
: The majority of the revenue improvement was due to increased volumes, principally in our domestic and Asian metalcasting markets, and our relatively new chromite product offerings. These metalcasting markets continue to experience an increase in demand resulting from automobile and heavy equipment castings.
Minerals & Materials
 
: The revenue increase resulted primarily from favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements as European currencies strengthened against the U.S. dollar. Organic revenue growth in Europe, partly resulting from the introduction of new product offerings, was offset by revenue decreases in the rest of the world due to decreases in our lining technologies business.
Environmental
 
: The growth in revenue occurred primarily in our domestic businesses, especially coil tubing, well-testing and pipeline services. Our coil tubing business continues to benefit from investments we've made in that business by expanding our service capacity in addition to growth in the Texas shale regions. Our well-testing and pipeline services also experienced increased demand as customers seek to improve production in existing assets. Our domestic filtration revenues suffered significantly this quarter due to depressed offshore activity resulting from the low amount of drilling permits being issued in the Gulf of Mexico. Regarding our foreign operations, revenues in Australia decreased (due to a large customer contract that ended in Q3 2010) while all other foreign businesses experienced revenue growth.
Oilfield Services
 
Nearly all of the revenue increase was due to increased fuel-surcharges. This segment continues to see an increase in services being provided to divisions of our domestic businesses, principally our metalcasting and pet products groups; these intercompany revenues are eliminated in the corporate segment.
Transportation:
 
Gross profit increased $12.7 million, or 21.8%. Gross margins also increased, by 310 basis points to 28.6%.
Gross profit:
 
Gross profit increased by 35.6% or $8.5 million. Approximately $1.5 million of this increase is attributable to the one-time reduction of our chromite mining costs. Another significant contributor to the increase is the turn-around in our personal care products business, which generated significant gross profit losses in Q3 2010. Finally, our chromite operations generated increased gross profits this quarter due to better production yields resulting from selectively mining ore which better suits our current production capabilities.
Minerals & Materials:
 
: Gross profits and gross margins increased slightly in this segment. Gross margin increases in our domestic business, led by improved product offerings in our building materials products and selling price increases in our lining technologies business, were dampened by decreases in our European businesses, which suffered due to production cost increases and lower margin contracting services work.
Environmental
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross profit and gross margins increased due to leverage from increased sales in our domestic coil tubing, pipeline and well testing services. Our foreign operations also increased gross margins, most notably in Malaysia and Nigeria. These increases were partially offset by gross margin decreases in our domestic filtration business, a high fixed cost business.
Oilfield Services:
 
The 23.4% increase in SG&A results from increased expenses across all businesses. Excluding gains and losses on market invested securities in our Corporate segment and a bad debt in our Environmental segment, SG&A expenses would have increased 16.3%. Our Corporate segment provides certain investments to fund long-term benefit programs, and these investments fluctuate with the value of the underlying securities. We had a large bad debt expense from a European customer who declared bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2011. Each of the segments experienced compensation and related benefit increases in addition to increases in certain categories of expenses, such as commissions, that generally increase with increased sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A):
 
Other, net is comprised of our gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and the corresponding derivative instruments used to hedge those transactions. The income from these transactions decreased significantly in the third quarter of 2011 due to the increased amount and effectiveness of derivatives used to mitigate the effect of the foreign currency transactions.
Other, net:
 
Our income tax expense and effective tax rate increased in the quarter due to differences in discrete items recorded between the two quarters. The prior year's quarterly effective tax rate is abnormally low given the amount of favorable, discrete items recorded in that quarter.
Income tax expense:
 
We generated increased income from our affiliates and joint ventures in Q3 2011 as compared to Q3 2010 due to a gain recorded on the sale of our Belgian joint-venture.
Income from affiliates and joint ventures:
 
In the third quarter of 2011, we sold our domestic contracting services business within our Environmental segment. All amounts generated from this business are now included within our losses from discontinued operations.
Income (loss) on discontinued operations:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
We compare several components of our balance sheet using amounts as of September 30, 2011 as compared to the amounts at December 31, 2010.
 
Our non-cash working capital increased by $46 million to support our revenue growth. We have financed this growth through long term debt, which increased by $14.2 million to $250.4 million, and greater utilization of our cash, which decreased by $17.9 million to $9.3 million. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization increased 110 basis points to 38.2%.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities was $16.6 million through the first nine months of 2011 as compared to $35.2 million in the prior-year period. The decrease results from cash used to fund growth in working capital, principally inventory for various factors, such as the ramp-up of our chromite operations.
 
Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 were $43.8 million as compared to $37.9 million in the prior-year's period. In each of these periods, expenditures associated with our start-up chromite operations were $5.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the majority of our capital spending occurred in our Oilfield Services and Minerals and Materials segments.
 
Dividends through September 30, 2011 remained roughly the same over the prior-year period as our dividend has remained constant at $0.18 per quarter per share.
 
This release should be read in conjunction with the attached unaudited, condensed, consolidated financial statements. It contains certain forward-looking statements regarding AMCOL's expected performance for future periods and actual results for such periods might materially differ.

On November 16, 2011, the Board of Directors of AMCOL International Corporation (the Company) approved certain amendments to the Companys Amended and Restated By-Laws.  Set forth below is a summary of these amendments.
 
The most significant change was the adoption of a majority-voting standard in uncontested director elections.  Article II, Section 12 of the By-Laws is amended to provide that in an uncontested director election, a candidate is elected or re-elected director only if the votes for his or her election exceed the votes against his or her election.  Previously, directors were elected under a plurality-voting standard, in which candidates receiving the most votes were elected regardless of whether those votes constituted a majority. Plurality voting will continue to apply in contested director elections.   The Board of Directors also amended the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines to include a resignation requirement for directors who fail to receive the required majority vote.   If an incumbent director does not receive the required vote for reelection, the amended Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Nominating and Governance Committee to decide whether to recommend that the board accept the directors resignation, and the board will ultimately determine whether to accept the resignation.
 
Article II, Section 12 is also amended to state that, when a proposal is approved by stockholders pursuant to a stock exchange rule or other regulation, the Company need only obtain the stockholder vote required by that rule or regulation in order for the proposal to pass (unless a greater vote is required by Delaware law).
 
Article II, Section 4 of the By-Laws permits the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock to call special meetings of stockholders.  The amendments clarify the procedures for delivering written requests for meetings and holding a special meeting called in this manner.
 
Article II, Section 7 of the By-Laws is amended to require that a stockholder who seeks to propose director nominees or a business proposal for approval at a stockholder meeting must provide AMCOL advance notice of certain background information on the stockholder proponent and on the director nominees or proposal.  Second, this Section is amended to extend the notice deadline for such proposals from 60 days to 90 days before the anniversary of the last stockholders meeting.  Third, this Section is amended to clarify that a stockholder must follow the notice procedures set forth in this Section in order to make a proposal.  Fourth, this Section is amended to require that a stockholder proponent must disclose whether they intend to solicit proxies in favor of their nominee(s) or proposal(s), and to condition the presentation of the proposal or nominee at the special meeting on whether the stockholder complies with their statement of intent. Finally, this Section is amended to require a stockholder submitting a proposal to disclose ownership of derivative instruments and other derivative positions.
 
Article IV, Section 4 of the By-Laws is amended to allow that directors may receive notice of special meetings by e-mail.  Certain other sections of the By-Laws were also amended to make reference to electronic communication and use of electronic means of storage.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Article V, Section 2 of the By-Laws is amended to remove the requirement that the CEO must be a director of the Company.
 
New Article V, Section 18 provides that the Board of Directors may delegate the powers or duties of any officer to any other officer or agents, notwithstanding any other provision of the By-Laws.
 
New Article VII Section 7 provides that whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of law or the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, a written or electronic waiver of notice from the person entitled to notice is deemed to be equivalent to notice. Attendance at a meeting that requires notice by the person entitled to notice also constitutes a waiver of notice.
 
Article VIII of the By-Laws is amended to require that amendments to the By-Laws of the Company by the stockholders may only be made upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the common stock outstanding. Prior to this amendment, stockholders could amend the By-Laws by a majority vote of the stockholders present at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
 
New Article X includes a forum selection provision, providing that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware would be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of the Company to it or its stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.
 
 
The foregoing description of the amendments is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Amended and Restated By-Laws filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.

Section 9.
 
Record Date for Action by Written Consent. In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting (including by telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission), the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolutions fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date (unless a record date has previously been fixed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 9). If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business or to any officer of agent of the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

Section 10.
 
Inspectors of Written Consent. In the event of the delivery, in the manner provided by Section 9, to the corporation of the requisite written consent or consents to take corporate action and/or any related revocation or revocations, the corporation shall engage nationally recognized independent inspectors of elections for the purpose of promptly performing a ministerial review of the validity of the consents and revocations. For the purpose of permitting the inspectors to perform such review, no action by written consent without a meeting shall be effective until such date as the independent inspectors certify to the corporation that the consents delivered to the corporation in accordance with Section 9 represent at least the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take the corporate action. Nothing contained in this paragraph shall in any way be construed to suggest or imply that the Board of Directors or any stockholder shall not be entitled to contest the validity of any consent or revocation thereof, whether before or after such certification by the independent inspectors, or to take any other action (including, without limitation, the commencement, prosecution or defense of any litigation with respect thereto, and the seeking of injunctive relief in such litigation).
 
Section 11.
 
Quorum. The holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise required by statute, the rules of any stock exchange upon which the corporations securities are listed, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, either the Chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally noticed. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board of Directors shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 213(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.
 
Section 12.
 
Powers of the Stockholders. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, a different vote is required or by express provision of any regulation (including the applicable rules of any stock exchange) a different vote is provided, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question.  A nominee for director shall be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast for such nominees election exceed the votes cast against such nominees election; provided, however, that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders if, on the tenth day before the corporation first mails its notice of meeting for such meeting, the number of nominees for director exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such meeting.  If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a director nominee.

Section 13.
 
Voting Rights of Stockholders. Each stockholder shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of the capital stock having voting power held by such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.
 
Section 14.
 
List of Stockholders. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting; provided, however, if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Nothing contained in this Section shall require the corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting:  (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the corporation.  In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation.  If the meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be examined by any stockholder who is present.  If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then such list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the meeting.
 
Section 15.
 
Action by Written Consent of Stockholders Instead of by Meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, whenever the vote of stockholders at a meeting is required or permitted to be taken in connection with any corporate action by any provisions of the statutes, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, such action may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present. Prompt notice of the taking of corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.
 
Section 16.
 
Manner of Sending Notice and Effective Date. If mailed, notices to stockholders shall be sent addressed to them at their respective addresses appearing on the books of the corporation. Notice shall be deemed to be given at the time the same shall be mailed.  Notices shall be given to stockholders in the manner provided in Section 222 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.  Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic transmission in the manner permitted by Section 232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Section 17.
 
Proxy. At any meeting of the stockholders, every stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy authorized by an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting. Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to this paragraph may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that, such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission. All voting, excepting where otherwise required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or the Board of Directors may be a voice vote.
 
Section 18.
 
Chairman of Meeting. The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders. In the absence or inability to act of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the chief executive officer, the president, an executive vice president or a vice president (in that order) shall preside, and in their absence or inability to act another person designated by one of them shall preside. The secretary of the corporation shall act as secretary of each meeting of the stockholders. In the event of his absence or inability to act, the presiding officer of the meeting shall appoint a person who need not be a stockholder to act as secretary of the meeting.
 
Section 19.
 
Conduct of Meetings. Meetings of the stockholders shall be conducted in a fair manner but need not be governed by any prescribed rules of order. The presiding officers rulings on procedural matters shall be final. The presiding officer is authorized to adjourn the meeting (whether or not a quorum is present), to impose reasonable time limits on the remarks of individual stockholders and to take such steps as such officer may deem necessary or appropriate to assure that the business of the meeting is conducted in a fair, orderly and prompt manner.  The presiding officer is authorized to impose such regulation of the manner of voting as seems to him or her in order.
 
 
Section 1.
 
Numbers and Manner of Election. The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board shall be a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of fifteen (15). The exact number of directors constituting the whole Board shall be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the entire Board of Directors.  The directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders, except as provided in Section 2 of this Article, and each director elected shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders. No decrease in the number of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director.

The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

Notice to the Lenders
 
(c).  Any outstanding Borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall automatically be continued for an additional Interest Period on the last day of its then current Interest Period unless the Company has notified the Administrative Agent within the period required by Section 1.5(a) that the applicable Borrower intends to convert such Borrowing, subject to Section 7.1 hereof, into a Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans or such Borrowing is prepaid in accordance with Section 1.8(a).

(e)  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, by 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on) the date on which such Lender is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of a Revolving Loan (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such payment when due and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the applicable Borrower the proceeds of the Loan to be made by such Lender and, if any Lender has not in fact made such payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Administrative Agent the amount made available to the applicable Borrower attributable to such Lender together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to the applicable Borrower and ending on (but excluding) the date such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent at a rate per annum equal to:  (i) from the date the related advance was made by the Administrative Agent to the date two (2) Business Days after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from the date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made by such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day.  If such amount is not received from such Lender by the Administrative Agent immediately upon demand, the applicable Borrower will, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of the Loan attributable to such Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan, but without such payment being considered a payment or prepayment of a Loan under Section 1.12 hereof so that such Borrower will have no liability under such Section with respect to such payment.

The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default or Event of Default exists unless notified in writing to the contrary by a Lender or the Company.  In all cases in which the Loan Documents do not require the Administrative Agent to take specific action, the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in using its discretion in failing to take or in taking any action thereunder.

The obligations of the Lenders under this Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to offset amounts received for the account of a Lender under this Agreement against unpaid amounts due from such Lender to the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder (whether as fundings of participations, indemnities or otherwise), but shall not be entitled to offset against amounts owed to the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender by any Lender arising outside of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

Upon any such resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent.  If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agents giving of notice of resignation or the removed Administrative Agents receipt of notice from the Required Lenders then the retiring or removed Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which may be any Lender hereunder or any commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $200,000,000.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations thereunder.  After any retiring or removed Administrative Agents resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 11 and all protective provisions of the other Loan Documents shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent, but no successor Administrative Agent shall in any event be liable or responsible for any actions of its predecessor.

If any such withholding is so required, such Borrower or such Guarantor shall make the withholding, pay the amount withheld to the appropriate governmental authority before penalties attach thereto or interest accrues thereon, and forthwith pay such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by each Lender and the Administrative Agent free and clear of such taxes (including such taxes on such additional amount) is equal to the amount which that Lender or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) would have received had such withholding not been made.  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender pays any amount in respect of any such taxes, penalties or interest, such Borrower or such Guarantor shall reimburse the Administrative Agent or such Lender for that payment on demand in the currency in which such payment was made.  If such Borrower or such Guarantor pays any such taxes, penalties or interest, it shall deliver official tax receipts evidencing that payment or certified copies thereof to the Lender or Administrative Agent on whose account such withholding was made (with a copy to the Administrative Agent if not the recipient of the original) on or before the thirtieth day after payment.

Inability of Lender to Submit Forms
 
  No delay or failure on the part of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender or on the part of the holder or holders of any of the Obligations in the exercise of any power or right under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right.

The information in this item is being furnished to, but not filed with, the Securities and Exchange Commission solely under Item 12 of Form 8-K, Results of Operations and Financial Condition, pursuant to interim procedures promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Release 33-8216 issued March 27, 2003.
On January 27, 2012, the registrant issued a press release to report results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011.
That press release dated, January 27, 2012 and titled AMCOL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (NYSE:ACO) REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
ITEM 9.01                      Financial Statements and Exhibits

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports Fourth Quarter Results
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - January 27, 2012) - For the fourth quarter of 2011, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) generated diluted earnings per share attributable to its shareholders from continuing operations of $0.43 per share versus a loss of $0.30 per share in the prior year's quarter. Excluding unusual items in Q4 2010, diluted earnings per share attributable to our shareholders was $0.21 per diluted share.
ACO
 
Net sales increased 6.5% to $233.7 million for the 2011 fourth quarter, as compared to $219.4 million for the 2010 period. Gross profit increased 16.1% while gross margin increased 220 basis points to 26.6%. Operating profit increased 63.8% with operating margin increasing by 300 basis points to 8.6%.
 
Other income, net included losses of $1.0 million in the prior year's quarter whereas this quarter's results include gains of $0.2 million. The difference results from better foreign currency management which has reduced the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our effective tax rate decreased in the quarter as compared to the prior year's quarter largely due to differences in non-recurring, discrete items between the two periods. Our income from joint-ventures and affiliates increased by $13.0 million to $1.5 million as the prior year's quarter includes impairments of our Belgian and Russian joint-ventures, both of which were sold prior to Q4 2011.
 
"Sales for the quarter were in line with our expectations. We were pleased with the sales growth and improvement in gross margin in our Minerals and Materials, and Oilfield Services segments, versus the prior year's quarter -- the most important factors leading to the increase in operating profit," said Ryan McKendrick, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
"Our Minerals and Materials segment generated 6% sales growth versus the prior year's Q4 with significant gross margin improvement. Market conditions for our metalcasting product line remained steady, and the outlook for 2012 remains positive. Our chromite product line also generated steady sales and an operating profit for the quarter. We expect the profit generated by these chromite products to improve after completion of equipment and process upgrades currently under way. Demand for oil drilling fluids and specialty products is expected to remain steady as well," continued McKendrick.
 
 
 
 
 
 
"We changed our Environmental segment's management and several product lines within the group are undergoing restructuring to better align the segment with changing market opportunities. Sales for the segment in the quarter were about equal to Q4 2010, but gross margin deteriorated as a result of pricing erosion in our lining technologies product line and lower than expected margins on contracting projects in Europe. In the US, we sold our contracting services product line in Q3 2011, and are in the process of significantly reducing our participation in contracting services in Europe. Price increases in the US lining technologies product line have started to show some positive effect for our core products, but were offset by low margin sales of purchased products on several large projects during the quarter. Building materials concluded a strong year resulting from expansion of its product portfolio and enhanced project support capabilities. Drilling products also continued its strong performance for the year," McKendrick added.
 
McKendrick continued, "Our Oilfield Services segment experienced a 24% increase in revenue vs. Q4 2010, with gross margin improvement versus the prior year's quarter. Coiled tubing services associated with hydraulic fracturing in various shale formations was the largest contributor to the growth in revenues. Pipeline services continue to experience strong growth and was the second largest contributor to growth for the segment in Q4 2011. Pipeline maintenance and integrity testing utilizes specialized Oilfield Services technology designed to handle high volumes of solids discharged from pipelines during cleaning operations. Sales of specialized water filtration services rebounded strongly sequentially, and were well ahead of the prior year's Q4 in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and Australia."
 
"In summary, the outlook for our major product lines remains largely positive. Our Minerals and Materials segment is positioned well in several industries that appear to provide prospects for steady growth. Our Environmental segment is undergoing a restructuring to be more closely aligned with market opportunities. Oilfield Services is positioned to participate in the fast growing hydraulic fracturing market, while continuing to meet the requirements of our customers with specialized technology in two important growth areas -- water treatment and pipeline services," he concluded.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release. The following comments relate to our results for the current quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
 
Net sales increased $14.3 million or 6.5%.
Net sales:
 
 
 
 
 
Minerals & Materials: Our US subsidiary accounted for 90.8% of the growth in revenues due to improved selling prices and additional volumes in metalcasting and oil drilling markets.
 
Environmental: Revenues increased slightly overall due to increases in our drilling and building materials groups, offset by decreases in lining technologies and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements.
 
Oilfield Services: Our domestic operations drove the revenue growth, led by our coil tubing, pipeline and nitrogen services. Coil tubing services are benefitting from increased services in various oil and gas bearing shale formations, and pipeline services have increased due to increased maintenance and integrity testing work. Also, our foreign operations generated increased revenues primarily in Malaysia, where demand for our well testing services is high, and Brazil, which is benefitting from increased demand for water filtration services in addition to expanding its customer base.
 
Transportation: Revenues decreased due to lower shipment volumes as there are fewer drivers available to haul loads. However, this segment continues to see an increase in services being provided to divisions of our domestic subsidiaries, principally our metalcasting and pet products groups; these intercompany revenues are eliminated in the Corporate segment.
 
Gross profit increased $8.6 million, or 16.1%. Gross margin also increased, by 220 basis points to 26.6%.
Gross profit:
 
Minerals & Materials: Approximately 80.0% of the increase in gross profit results from selling price increases worldwide. In addition, Q4 2010 had approximately $2.1 million of expenses associated with operational issues in our domestic personal care business unit which did not recur in 2011.
 
Environmental: Gross profit decreased due to cost overruns on contracting work in Europe combined with increased manufacturing costs in the US resulting from decreased volumes of lining technologies products. These factors also negatively affected the gross profit margin. Product mix within our building materials group also negatively affected margins as sales were a little more concentrated in lower margin products.
 
Oilfield Services: Our foreign operations account for the majority of the increase in gross profit as both Malaysia and Brazil experienced significant increases. Malaysia benefitted from more profitable well testing services and Brazil benefitted from improved pricing on new contracts. On a combined basis, our domestic pipeline and nitrogen services also contributed significantly to the increase in gross profit due to increased leverage on those sales.
 
 
 
 
 
SG&A expenses increased minimally overall. Within the segments, expenses in our Oilfield Services segment increased due to employee compensation and employee related costs while expenses decreased in our Corporate segment as the prior year's quarter includes one-time expenses associated with the retirement of our prior CEO.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A):
 
Other, net is comprised of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and the corresponding derivative instruments used to hedge those transactions. The income from these transactions increased as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 due to the increased amount and effectiveness of derivatives used to mitigate the effect of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates.
Other, net:
 
Our income tax expense and effective tax rate decreased in the quarter due to differences in discrete items recorded between the two quarters. The prior year's quarterly effective tax rate was abnormally high given (i) the amount of unfavorable, discrete items recorded and (ii) the effect of changes in geographical earnings distribution estimates.
Income tax expense:
 
The loss recorded in Q4 2010 resulted from impairments associated with our Belgian and Russian joint-ventures, both of which were subsequently sold in 2011 before the fourth quarter began. In addition, income from our Japanese investment increased due to the JV's improved performance resulting from favorable market conditions in Japan.
Income from affiliates and joint ventures:
 
In the third quarter of 2011, we sold our domestic contracting services business within our Environmental segment. All amounts generated from this business are now included within our losses from discontinued operations.
Income (loss) on discontinued operations:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
We compare several components of our balance sheet and cash flow statement using amounts as of and for the year ending December 31, 2011 as compared to the amounts as of and for the year ending December 31, 2010.
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities decreased due to increased investments in working capital, principally inventory and accounts receivable, to support our sales growth. Our working capital excluding cash increased by $48.7 million. We have financed this increase through long term debt, which increased by $24.5 million to $260.7 million, and increased cash from our operating profits. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization increased 230 basis points to 39.4%.
 
 
 
 
 
Capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $61.0 million as compared to $47.3 million in the prior year. Expenditures associated with our start-up chromite operations were $8.2 million and $14.9 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2011, the majority of our capital spending occurred in our Oilfield Services and Minerals and Materials segments.
 
Dividends for 2011 increased 1.8% over the prior year although our quarterly dividend rate has remained constant at $0.18 per share.

In addition, for Mr. Carpenter, a change of control will be deemed to have occurred if AMCOL sells a majority of the stock or assets of the Environmental segment, and Mr. Carpenter oversees the operation of such segment.
 
The Change of Control Agreements incorporate by reference the confidentiality and non-compete provisions of previously executed Confidentiality Agreements and Covenants Not to Compete which contain confidentiality and one year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in favor of AMCOL.

Executive Severance Plan
 
In March 2011, AMCOLs Compensation Committee adopted the AMCOL International Corporation Executive Severance Plan, effective on June 11, 2011.  The Compensation Committee can terminate or amend the Executive Severance Plan at any time.  Any such termination shall not effect those employees previously terminated and receiving payments.

This Change of Control Agreement (the Agreement) is made and entered into as of February 23, 2012 by and between James W. Ashley, Jr. (the Executive) and AMCOL International Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company).
 
WHEREAS, it is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of an acquisition by another company or other change of control transaction.
 
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the Board) recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to Executive and can cause Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities.

WHEREAS, the Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to provide Executive with an incentive to continue Executives employment and to motivate Executive to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its stockholders.
 
WHEREAS, the Board believes that it is imperative to provide Executive with severance benefits upon Executives termination of employment in connection with a Change of Control to provide enhanced financial security and incentive and encouragement to Executive to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control.

.  This Agreement shall become effective on February 23, 2012 (the Effective Date) and shall terminate on  June 11, 2014 (the Termination Date), or upon termination of Executives employment more than 120 days prior to or more than one year after a Change of Control, whichever comes first.

(i)
 
.  An operating business segment (other than the transportation segment) shall be considered a segment for purposes of this Section 3(e) if the Company classifies it as a segment in its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the sale.

.  An Executive will not be considered to have terminated employment if he is offered employment with the purchaser of the segment on substantially similar terms as his employment with the Company prior to the sale.

.  For purposes of calculating the cash award under Section 3(a)(i)(B), the target bonus amount for Executive under the Companys annual bonus program with respect to the year immediately preceding thesale of the segment (or the year immediately preceding the termination of employment, if earlier), will be used instead of the target bonus amount with respect to the year of sale of the segment.

(iii)

Sale of a Segment
 
(i)
 
.  An operating business segment (other than the transportation segment) shall be considered a segment for purposes of this Section 3(e) if the Company classifies it as a segment in its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the sale.  As of the Effective Date, the Company has three such operating business segments: Minerals and Materials; Environmental; and Oilfield Services.
Definition of Segment
 
(ii)
 
.  An Executive will not be considered to have terminated employment if he is offered employment with the purchaser of the segment on substantially similar terms as his employment with the Company prior to the sale.
Termination of Employment
 
(iii)
 
.  For purposes of calculating the cash award under Section 3(a)(i)(B), the target bonus amount for Executive under the Companys annual bonus program with respect to the year immediately preceding thesale of the segment (or the year immediately preceding the termination of employment, if earlier), will be used instead of the target bonus amount with respect to the year of sale of the segment.

The prorated amount shall be determined based on performance to date and on the number of days which have elapsed in such fiscal year through the date of the Change of Control.

Code Section 409A
 
(i)
 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no amount deemed deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be payable to Executive hereunder unless Executives termination of employment constitutes a separation from service with the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the Department of Treasury regulations and other guidance promulgated thereunder.  In addition, if Executive is deemed by the Company at the time of Executives separation from service to be a specified employee for purposes of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, to the extent delayed commencement of any portion of the benefits to which Executive is entitled under this Agreement is required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such portion of Executives benefits shall not be provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six-month period measured from the date of Executives separation from service with the Company (as such term is defined in the Treasury Regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code) or (ii) the date of Executives death.

Additionally, in the event that following the date hereof the Company or Executive reasonably determines that any compensation or benefits payable under this Agreement may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company and Executive shall work together to adopt such amendments to this Agreement or adopt other policies or procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other commercially reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to (i) exempt the compensation and benefits payable under this Agreement from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the compensation and benefits provided with respect to this Agreement or (ii) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance.  To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with Section 409A of the Code, the provision will be read in such a manner so that all payments hereunder comply with Section 409A of the Code.
 
 
9
 
 
 
(iii)
 
For purposes of Section 409A of the Code (including, without limitation, for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii)), Executives right to receive any installment payments under this Agreement shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate payments and, accordingly, each such installment payment shall at all times be considered a separate and distinct payment.
 
(iv)
 
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to the extent any expense reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit under this Agreement is determined to be subject to Section 409A of the Code, the amount of any such expenses eligible for reimbursement, or the provision of any in-kind benefit, in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses), in no event shall any expenses be reimbursed after the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which Executive incurred such expenses, and in no event shall any right to reimbursement or the provision of any in-kind benefit be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.

On March 14, 2012, CETCO Oilfield Services Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMCOL International Corporation, entered into the 2012 Performance Agreement (the 2012 Performance Agreement) with Michael Johnson, our Vice-President and President of the Oilfield Services Segment.   Pursuant to the 2012 Performance Agreement, Mr. Johnson is eligible to earn a portion of the cumulative adjusted annual increase in operating profit of the Oilfield Services Segment as compared to the greater of (i) the 2011 operating profit and (ii) the operating profit for any prior fiscal year commencing with 2012.  The relevant performance period is the four year period ending December 31, 2015.  The amount payable with respect to each year in the performance period, if any, will be determined based on the Oilfield Services Segments return on capital employed for the relevant year.
 
Any amounts payable pursuant to the Performance Agreement will be offset by amounts paid in February 2014 pursuant to Mr. Johnsons 2010 Performance Agreement.  Payments under the 2012 Performance Agreement will be made on February 15, 2016, provided Mr. Johnson remains employed by AMCOL.  Other members of senior management of the Oilfield Services Segment were granted similar awards.
 
The Compensation Committee approved these awards based on the recommendation of senior management.  In structuring and approving these opportunities, the Compensation Committee recognized that the Oilfield Services Segment includes high-growth, sophisticated and competitive businesses whose success requires experienced and dedicated senior managers.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports First Quarter Results
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - April 27, 2012) - For the first quarter of 2012, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) generated diluted earnings per share attributable to its shareholders from continuing operations of $0.43 per share versus $0.38 per share in the prior year's quarter. This $0.43 per share is reduced by $0.01 per share for discontinued operations, leading to $0.42 of net income per share attributable to our shareholders.
ACO
 
Net sales increased 8.3% to $235.8 million for the 2012 first quarter, as compared to $217.8 million for the 2011 period. Gross profit increased 12.8% while gross margin increased 110 basis points to 27.6%. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.5 million, or 11.5%; approximately $1.3 million of this increase relates to a bad debt expense in our Oilfield Services segment. Operating profit increased 15.6% with operating profit margins increasing by 60 basis points to 9.1%.
 
Other income, net includes an expense of $1.8 million in the current quarter to provide for estimated losses on certain non-operating assets. Our effective tax rate for the 2012 quarter was 25.1% and includes $0.5 million of benefits related to non-recurring, discrete items; excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate would have been 28.1%.
 
"We are pleased with our first quarter results, with revenue growth of 8.3% and an increase in EPS from continuing operations of 13.2% as compared to the first quarter of 2011," said Ryan McKendrick, AMCOL President and Chief Executive Officer.
 
"Our Minerals and Materials segment generated 7.4% revenue growth vs. prior year Q1 with continued gross margin improvement. Our domestic metalcasting product line continued its strong performance and the outlook for the remainder of 2012 remains positive. Demand for this segment's drilling fluids and several specialty products is expected to remain steady as well. Despite slower growth from China, our Minerals and Materials operations in Asia increased sales and operating profit in Q1 on strong performance from metalcasting product lines in Thailand and South Korea. Sales and operating profit generated in our European Minerals and Materials markets remained fairly steady, despite the difficult economic environment in Europe. Our worldwide chromite operations generated steady sales and an operating profit for the quarter despite plant down time incurred to make required equipment upgrades. We continue to start-up and commission new equipment for our chromite processing plant, and we expect this process to be largely completed in Q2 2012," continued McKendrick.
 
 
 
 
 
"Our Environmental segment's sales for the quarter were slightly ahead of 2011, but gross margin dropped, primarily as a result of low margins on contracting projects in Europe that are in the final stages of completion. We are in the process of reducing our participation in the contracting business in Europe. Sales of lining technologies products were impacted by lower demand for landfill liner systems both in the US and in Europe. As the pricing environment in this market remains competitive, we continue to address our cost structure and introduce new technologies to improve financial results. The slower sales of lining technology products was offset by increased sales of building materials products, and specialty products for the foundation drilling and directional drilling markets. Our building materials product sales increased significantly vs. the prior year as we continued to promote new products for a broader range of applications while offering enhanced, on-site project support capabilities," McKendrick added.
 
McKendrick continued, "Our Oilfield Services segment experienced a 23.7% increase in sales revenue vs. Q1 2011, with gross margin remaining relatively steady. Coiled tubing services and filtration services were the primary sales growth drivers in the North American market. The steady increase in activity in oil rich basins continued in the first quarter, with a 12% increase in the US oil related rig count largely offsetting the 17% decline in natural gas related rig count. We are well positioned to service customers operating in the oil-rich basins, including the Eagle Ford and Permian. We expect to see increasing pricing pressure due to excess service equipment availability in certain basins, but the impact has been minimal so far. Activity is slowly increasing in the deep water market where we expect demand for our filtration services to improve. In Brazil, sales and operating profits improved significantly vs. prior year Q1 as demand for filtration services provided to customers operating in deep water continues to increase. All of our other international markets -- Malaysia, Nigeria, North Sea, and Australia -- contributed to the growth in revenue and operating profit for the quarter."
 
"In summary, the global demand for many of the diverse products and services within AMCOL's portfolio remains largely positive. We expect to continue broadening our technology portfolio and further develop our existing global footprint to bring value to our customers," he concluded.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release. The following comments relate to our results for the current quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
 
Net sales increased $18.0 million or 8.3%.
Net sales:
 
 
 
 
 
: Selling price increases accounted for an overwhelming majority of the growth in revenues. The price increases occurred especially in our metalcasting products and drilling fluid products, which lie within our basic minerals product line.
Minerals & Materials
 
: Revenues increased slightly overall as increases in our drilling and building materials product lines were nearly offset by decreases in our lining technology and contracting services product lines. Building materials product line sales increased due to increased demand for newly introduced products. Our drilling product line sales have also increased. Demand for lining technology products and systems has decreased in the US and Europe while competition remains strong.
Environmental
 
: Our international operations generated 62% of the increase in this segment's sales due to growth in demand and new contracts with customers. Domestic sales increased, largely in our coil tubing and filtration service lines, due to an increase in overall demand and increased service capacity given capital equipment we purchased late in 2011.
Oilfield Services
 
: Revenues decreased due to lower shipment volumes. Driver availability has decreased given competition for their services in other markets, including the oil and gas shale regions near the Dakotas.
Transportation
 
Gross profit increased $7.4 million, or 12.8% which exceeds the rate sales increased. Gross margin also increased, by 110 basis points to 27.6%.
Gross profit:
 
: Increased selling prices partially offset by increased costs comprise approximately 78.3% of the increase in gross profit. We have been able to increase selling prices worldwide, but mostly in our metalcasting and drilling additive product lines. We've experienced cost increases in these areas as well but have also enjoyed decreased production costs in our chromite operations as volumes have increased.
Minerals & Materials
 
: Low production volumes and low margins on contracting services jobs in Europe led to the decrease in gross profits and gross profit margins. Increased sales of lower margin, accessory products also contributed to the decreases.
Environmental
 
: Gross profits increased in line with sales and margins remained relatively stable overall. However, our gross profit margins in our domestic operations decreased whereas our international operations increased. Domestically, our coil tubing services experienced increased costs associated with commissioning new equipment. Sales in our international operations benefitted from more profitable water treatment revenues.
Oilfield Services
 
 
 
 
 
SG&A expenses increased by $4.5 million or 11.5%. The increase includes the aforementioned $1.3 million of bad debt expense within our Oilfield Services segment as well as $0.7 million of impairments related to corporate information technology assets.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A):
 
Other, net includes an expense of $1.8 million to provide for estimated losses on certain non-operating assets; the expense accounts for the significant fluctuation in Other, net as compared to the prior year's quarter.
Other, net:
 
Our income tax expense and effective tax rate decreased in the quarter due to differences in discrete items recorded between the two quarters. Our effective tax rate decreased in the quarter and includes $0.5 million of benefits related to non-recurring, discrete items; excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate would have been 28.1%.
Income tax expense:
 
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The paragraphs in this section discuss our comparison of our balance sheet as of March 31, 2012 to that as of December 31, 2011. We also make comparisons between cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2012 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011.
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities increased largely due to improved performance of non-cash working capital. We also paid down $10.0 million of long-term debt during the period. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased 220 basis points to 37.2%.
 
Capital expenditures were $16.6 million as compared to $10.4 million in the prior year period. Expenditures associated with our start-up chromite operations were $4.1 million and $0.7 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. In the current quarter, the majority of our capital spending occurred in our Oilfield Services and Minerals and Materials segments.
 
Dividends for 2012 remained constant at $0.18 per share.

For the second quarter of 2012, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) generated diluted earnings per share attributable to its shareholders from continuing operations of $0.65 per share versus $0.42 per share in the prior years quarter.
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL, July 27, 2012
Net sales increased 6.1% to $257.5 million for the 2012 second quarter as compared to $242.8 million for the 2011 period.  Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, revenues would have increased 9.1%.  Gross profit increased 19.5% while gross margin increased 320 basis points to 28.8%.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.4% to $43.3 million.  Operating profit increased 41.7% with operating profit margins increasing by 300 basis points to 12.0%.  Our effective tax rate for the 2012 quarter was 28.3%.
Our second quarter results demonstrate that we are executing on our profitable growth strategy despite a volatile, global economy.  The strength of AMCOLs diverse portfolio of products and services was demonstrated by strong segment performance in both Minerals & Materials and Oilfield Services while our Environmental segment continues to see weakened demand, said AMCOL President and CEO Ryan McKendrick.
Minerals & Materials increased revenues 11% with operating profit increasing significantly. Increased sales of metalcasting products and drilling fluid products were the primary growth drivers,   McKendrick continued.
Our Environmental segment had another difficult quarter.  Over forty-three percent of the segments sales are in Europe, where sharp declines in overall construction activity are affecting both the lining and building materials markets.  In addition, we are seeing continued softness in the domestic market for lining products.  However, our domestic building materials and drilling products within the segment continue to perform well, McKendrick added.
McKendrick continued, Our Oilfield Services domestic activities, including coiled tubing, filtration, well testing, and nitrogen, all delivered another quarter of revenue growth. Our strategy to further develop services in international locations where we have an established presence is paying off as revenue from these locations, such as Brazil and Malaysia, almost doubled and now account for 25% of segment sales.

Our outlook remains largely positive.  Our strategy of standardizing business processes to support growth while broadening our technology portfolio and continuing to develop a global footprint in emerging markets is on track, he concluded.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release. The following comments relate to our results for the current quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
 Net sales increased $14.7 million or 6.1%.
Net sales:
:  Increased volumes accounted for the increase in net sales as price increases were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, principally the Turkish lira and South African rand.  Metalcasting and drilling product sales to the oil and gas market increased significantly due to increased demand.
Minerals & Materials
:  Approximately 39% of the $13.5 million decrease in sales resulted from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, almost entirely in our European subsidiaries.  The majority of the remaining decrease occurred in our European subsidiaries as a result of our decision to reduce our involvement in contracting services.  Domestically, our lining product sales have decreased due to lower market demand; these reductions have overshadowed increased sales of our drilling products.
Environmental
:   This segment has experienced strong growth due to an increase in both demand and our service capacity from recent acquisitions of equipment.  Our domestic operations generated 58% of the increase in sales, the majority of which occurred in our coil tubing and nitrogen product lines.  Internationally, nearly all of our operations experienced significant growth.
Oilfield Services
  Revenues decreased due primarily to lower shipment volumes.  Driver availability has decreased given competition for their services in other markets, including the oil and gas shale regions near the Dakotas.  Decreased fuel surcharges comprised 23% of the decrease in sales.
Transportation:
  The increase in gross profits, $12.1 million or 19.5%, significantly exceeded the rate at which sales increased.  Gross margin increased 320 basis points to 28.8%.
Gross profit:
Increased volumes accounted for two thirds of the increase in gross profit.
Minerals & Materials:

:  Although gross profits decreased due to the decrease in sales, gross margins increased slightly for several reasons.  First, our sales are more concentrated in higher margin building materials products, especially considering the decrease in contracting revenues in Europe.  In addition, our international operations experienced slight increases in their gross margins due to price increases.  Both of these increases were somewhat offset by lower margins in our domestic subsidiary that resulted from lower volumes, reflective of the decrease in lining product sales.
Environmental
 
  Increased sales and gross margins contributed to the growth in gross profits; gross margins improved 600 basis points.  The increases occurred in both our foreign and domestic businesses.  Domestically, our coil tubing and nitrogen services increased their margins significantly due to increased operating leverage.  Our international operations are improving due to new management put in place in 2011 and greater economies of scale.
Oilfield Services:
Excluding $1.0 million of favorable, one-time income related items in our Environmental segment in the second quarter, SG&A expenses increased $4.0 million, or 9.9%.  On a combined basis, our Minerals & Materials and Oilfield Services segments SG&A expenses increased $4.3 million, and most of this relates to increased employee headcounts, compensation and benefit expenses.  Approximately $0.8 million of the $2.0 million reduction in SG&A expenses in our Environmental segment resulted from favorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, mostly in Europe; the remaining reduction relates primarily to the gains recorded as a result of favorable settlements on certain lawsuits.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A):
 
  Other, net expenses increased $1.1 million due to losses on foreign currency transactions.  The losses in 2012 relate largely to fluctuations in exchange rates between the USD and Malaysian ringgit, pound sterling, and South African rand as well as between the euro and Polish zloty.
Other, net:
  Income tax expense increased due to increased income.  Our effective tax rate decreased 200 basis points due to differences in the distribution of income across our businesses worldwide.  The effective tax rate for the 2012 quarter was 28.3%.
Income tax expense:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
The paragraphs in this section discuss our comparison of our balance sheet as of June 30, 2012 to that as of December 31, 2011.  We also make comparisons between cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2011.
 
 
 
 
 
AMCOL International Corporation
Q2 2012 Earnings Release
July 27, 2012
Page 4
Cash flow generated from operating activities increased largely due to improved performance of non-cash working capital, greater net income, and $6.1 million of increased non-cash charges.  Approximately $3.1 million of these non-cash charges result from increased bad debt expenses relating to litigation matters in our Oilfield Services and Environmental segments.  We also paid down $9.7 million of long-term debt during the period.  Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased 230 basis points to 37.1%.
Capital expenditures were $32.2 million as compared to $24.8 million in the prior year period.  Expenditures associated with our start-up chromite operations were $4.5 million and $2.8 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.  In the current year, the majority of our capital spending occurred in our Oilfield Services and Minerals & Materials segments.
Dividends for 2012 remained constant at $0.18 per share for the quarter.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
For the third quarter of 2012, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) generated diluted earnings attributable to its shareholders from continuing operations of $0.58 per share versus $0.66 per share in the prior years quarter, which included a $0.07 per share benefit from the gain on the sale of our Belgian joint venture investment and a $0.03 per share benefit from the favorable settlement of tax audits.
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL, October 26, 2012
Net sales increased 2.1% to $253.3 million for the 2012 third quarter as compared to $248.1 million for the 2011 period.  Excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, net sales would have increased 4.7%.  Our results were negatively impacted by the performance of our lining technologies product line, which continues to face increased competition in a declining market.  We are addressing these challenges by developing new products and targeting new markets.
Gross profit decreased 1.7% in the 2012 third quarter, and gross profit margin decreased 110 basis points to 27.4%.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 5.0% to $41.8 million.  Operating profit increased 3.8% to $27.6 million, and operating profit margins remained relatively constant at approximately 10.9%.  Our effective tax rate for the 2012 third quarter was 29.5% compared to 22.5% in the prior year period.  Excluding the favorable resolution of tax audits, the effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2011, would have been 26.7%.  In addition as previously mentioned, income from joint ventures and affiliates decreased $1.9 million in the current year period as the prior year period included a $2.1 million, or $0.07 per share, gain from the sale of a joint venture investment in Belgium.
As the year has progressed, we have seen continued economic weakening and uncertainty impacting end markets in a number of sectors  especially those related to certain construction and consumer products as customers have delayed projects and reduced orders, said AMCOL President and CEO Ryan McKendrick.
 In Minerals & Materials, we saw continued strength in the domestic metalcasting business, but we experienced a 1.1% decline in segment sales resulting partially from lower demand for drilling additives and pet products.  Our manufacturing facilities reacted quickly to the reductions and, as a result, maintained gross margin above 25%,   McKendrick continued.
 
 
 
 
 
Our Environmental segment experienced a 15.0% decline in sales  primarily due to market conditions that have negatively impacted lining technologies demand and our decision to significantly reduce our contracting services.  We continue to focus on growing sales in our building materials and construction related drilling product lines which now account for 50% of segment sales.  As a result, gross margin for the segment improved to 32.6%, McKendrick added.
.
McKendrick continued, In Oilfield Services, we achieved record revenues and operating profit with the strengthening of our market position in key international markets and in service lines where we anticipate growth in the coming years. Pricing pressures and cost increases in our coil tubing services adversely affected our results along with activity disruptions caused by Hurricane Isaac
We are confident in the long term fundamentals of our business, and our growth strategy remains unchanged.  We continue building the framework to maintain our leadership position in key product lines by expanding our global presence and developing a balanced participation in growing market sectors such as energy, industrial, consumer, and infrastructure, he concluded.
 
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release. The following comments relate to our results for the current quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
 Net sales increased $5.2 million or 2.1%.
Net sales:
:  Increased selling prices were overshadowed by lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, leading to the overall decrease in sales.  Volumes have decreased in our pet products and drilling additive products (within basic minerals).  In pet products, we are seeing lower overall market demand.  Our drilling fluid additives have suffered due to inventory destocking by customers.   Although our metalcasting product line sales increased, we are seeing a decrease in demand in China due to decreased infrastructure related castings.
Minerals & Materials
:  Approximately 37% of the $10.7 million decrease in sales resulted from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, almost entirely in our European subsidiaries.  The majority of the remaining decrease also occurred in these European subsidiaries as a result of our decision to downsize our contracting services.  Our lining technologies product line also continues to experience weakened demand due to a declining market and increased competition.  These reductions have overshadowed increased sales of our drilling products.
Environmental
:   This segment has experienced strong growth due to increases in demand and our service capacity as well as growth in our international operations.  Our international operations generated 69.5% of the increase in sales, the majority of which is related to our water filtration business.  Domestically, our revenues increased in our water filtration, well testing and pipeline services.
Oilfield Services
 
 
 
 
 
  Revenues decreased primarily due to lower shipment volumes. Revenues continue to suffer from decreased supply of carriers and owner operators who are being recruited to oil and gas opportunities within the Bakken shale region.
Transportation:
  Gross profit decreased by $1.2 million, or 1.7%, to $69.4 million.  Gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 27.4%.
Gross profit:
Gross profit and gross profit margin in this segment was comparable to the prior year quarter.
Minerals & Materials:
:  Gross profit decreased due to less sales, however, gross profit margin increased 150 basis points due to better cost management, a beneficial change in product mix, and increased selling prices in our drilling and building materials product lines.
Environmental
  Nearly all of the improvement in this segments gross profits occurred in our international operations where performance has improved due to new management, increasing demand for our services, and greater success at winning large contracts.  Domestically, revenues were stagnant in our coil tubing services, where gross profit margins also suffered due to pricing pressures and cost increases.
Oilfield Services:
SG&A expenses decreased $2.2 million, or 5.0%, due largely to decreases in our Environmental and Corporate segments.  Our Environmental segment benefitted equally from favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements and decreased bad debt expenses.  Our Corporate segments expenses decreased due to decreased employee benefit expenses.  Our Minerals & Materials segments expenses increased 10% due to a variety of factors, the largest of which is increased headcounts and compensation.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A):
 
  The prior year period includes favorable settlements on income tax audits which depressed the effective income tax rate in that period by 420 basis points.  The current periods pre-tax income is more concentrated in higher tax rate jurisdictions; the current periods effective tax rate is 29.5%.
Income tax expense:
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
The paragraphs in this section compare our balance sheet as of September 30, 2012 to that as of December 31, 2011.  We also make comparisons between cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011.
Cash flow generated from operating activities increased $55.9 million largely due to improved management of non-cash working capital and greater net income.  Our accounts receivable and inventory balances have increased at a slower rate as compared to the prior year period.  We also paid down $16.8 million of long-term debt during the current period as opposed to borrowing $14.9 million in the prior year period.  Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased 460 basis points to 35.1%.
Capital expenditures were $54.2 million as compared to $43.8 million in the prior year period.  Expenditures associated with our start-up chromite operations were $7.1 million and $5.9 million in the 2012 and 2011 periods, respectively.  In the current year, the majority of our capital spending occurred in our Oilfield Services and Minerals & Materials segments.
 
 
 
 
Dividends for 2012 remained fairly constant between the periods.  However, our dividend rate increased in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2012 by $0.02 to $0.20 per share.

AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports Imminent Filing of Second Quarter Form 10-Q
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - October 25, 2012) - On July 27, 2012, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ) announced its second quarter earnings and, subsequently on August 10, 2012, announced the delayed filing of its Form 10-Q for the second quarter. The delay was required due to our determination, at the time, that we may need to reduce the value of inventory recorded in our Environmental segment's Spanish operations. We are pleased to announce that we have completed our investigation into these and other matters and that we expect to file our second quarter Form 10-Q on October 30, 2012.
ACO
 
We evaluated the inventory errors in conjunction with other prior year errors that were previously known and had been determined to be immaterial. We concluded that all of these errors were individually and collectively immaterial to our previously issued financial statements. However, we concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that our financial statements for the twelve months ending December 31, 2012 will be materially misstated if we correct these prior year errors in the current year. Under current SEC regulations, correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors does not require our previously filed reports to be amended; rather, the SEC allows these corrections to be made when we incorporate our prior year financial statements in our 2012 Form 10-K.
 
On a combined basis, these errors have the effect of reducing earnings per share available to AMCOL shareholders prior to 2009, in 2009, and in 2010 by $0.02, $0.05, and $0.04, respectively, and increasing it by $0.01 and $0.01 in 2011 and the three months ended March 31, 2012, respectively. In addition for the three months ended June 30, 2012, our diluted earnings per share is now $0.67 compared to the $0.65 reported in our July 27, 2012 press release.

Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below):
 
 
 
 
On January 25, 2013, AMCOL International Corporation (AMCOL) issued a press release reporting results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2012.  In addition, AMCOL reported that it intends to amend its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 to restate the financial results for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, as well as to amend its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2012 to restate the quarterly results contained therein.  Please see Item 4.02 below for information regarding the restatement.
 
A copy of AMCOLs press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference.
 
 
On January 23, 2013, AMCOLs Audit Committee, upon the recommendation of AMCOLs management, determined that AMCOLs audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 need to be restated as a result of certain adjustments and should no longer be relied upon.  AMCOLs Form 10-K for the 2012 fiscal year, when filed, will reflect certain immaterial adjustments relating to the Supplemental Errors in AMCOLs 2012 second and third quarter results.
 
In January 2013, during the course of preparing to announce our 2012 fourth quarter earnings, we discovered certain errors in our previously issued financial statements related to our Construction Technologies segments European operations (collectively, the Supplemental Errors).  Note that in our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012, we reported errors relating to the Spanish operations of our Construction Technologies segment as well as other immaterial errors which were not previously corrected prior to filing of that Form 10-Q (the Initial Errors).
 
The following chart below reflects the extent to which the Supplemental Errors and the Initial Errors increase or (decrease) net income available to AMCOL shareholders (in millions) in each of the relevant periods.
 
 
 
 
 
In January 2013, we assessed the materiality of the Initial Errors together with the Supplemental Errors in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, Materiality, and in accordance with the rollover and iron curtain methods as described in SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.  Based on this assessment, we concluded that the Initial Errors and the Supplemental Errors were collectively material to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the three months ending March 31, 2012.  As required in SAB No. 108, we will amend our Form 10-K for the 2011 year to restate the results for that year and the preceding years contained in that report as well as amend our Form 10-Q for the three months ending March 31, 2012.  We will file an amended Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and an amended Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 as soon as possible.
 
 
In connection with the issues described above, we reevaluated the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2011 and for the three months ending March 31, 2012.  As of December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012, we have concluded that we had a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to the European operations of the Construction Technologies segment. We will report this material weakness and our plans for remediation in the amended Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  We are in the process of reassessing our evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures for the relevant periods.
 
Our management and our Audit Committee have discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02 with Ernst & Young LLP, AMCOLs independent registered public accounting firm.
 
A copy of AMCOLs press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL, JANUARY 25, 2013
Announcement of Fourth Quarter Results
For the fourth quarter of 2012, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE:ACO) generated diluted earnings attributable to its shareholders from continuing operations of $0.37 per share versus $0.39 per share in the prior years quarter.
Net sales increased 2.3% to $239.1 million for the 2012 fourth quarter, compared to $233.8 million in the 2011 period.  Gross profit increased $0.1 million in the 2012 fourth quarter, and gross profit margin decreased 60 basis points to 26.0%.  Operating profit decreased 8.4% to $18.6 million, and operating profit margins decreased 90 basis points to 7.8%.  Our effective tax rate for the 2012 fourth quarter was 24.7% compared to 34.5% in the prior year period.
We have renamed three of our segments to better reflect the business in which we operate.  The Minerals and Materials, Environmental and Oilfield Services segments are now named Performance Materials, Construction Technologies and Energy Services, respectively.
Our Energy Services segment delivered strong results for the fourth quarter, but continued softness in several end markets impacted our Performance Materials and Construction Technologies segments.  As a result, our quarterly results were below our expectations, said AMCOL President and CEO Ryan McKendrick.
The Performance Materials segments revenues and gross margins declined in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2011.  Decreased demand in our fabric care (specialty materials) and pet products were the main drivers of decreased performance in this segment; we do not expect a significant rebound in either of these product lines as we progress through 2013.   Although our results reflect a continued softness in drilling fluid additive sales, we now see a gradual increase in demand developing, McKendrick continued.
Our Construction Technologies segments sales declined primarily as a result of lower sales for our lining technologies products both domestically and in Europe.  However, we continue to experience growth in sales and profitability for our domestic building materials products.  Gross margin for the segment was in excess of 30% as actions to reduce manufacturing costs continue to produce results, McKendrick added.
 
 
 
 
McKendrick continued, Our Energy Services segment achieved record revenue and operating profit, driven primarily by increased domestic revenues in both land-based and offshore activities.  Based on feedback from our key customers, the outlook for water treatment, well testing, and coiled tubing services in geographic areas where we are active remains strong.  International business activity also continued to be well above the prior year.
We continue to focus on building the framework necessary to maintain a leadership position in multiple, attractive market sectors.    In addition, we will continue to actively manage our business portfolio, which in 2013 is likely to result in consolidation and restructuring of certain operations that do not fit our strategic and financial performance objectives. We anticipate restructuring charges in 2013 associated with these actions to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million, he concluded.
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release. The following comments relate to our results for the current quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
 Net sales increased $5.3 million or 2.3%.  Significant increases in revenue in our Energy Services segment were offset by decreased sales in each of the other segments.
Net sales:
:  Sales in this segment decreased 4.7% to $114.6 million due to a $7.1 million decrease in our domestic market ($11.8 million of decreased volumes offset by $4.7 million of selling price increases).
Performance Materials
:  Sales in this segment decreased 7.6%, or $4.1 million, to $50.1 million.  Contracting services revenue decreased $1.8 million, reflective of our strategy to reduce our participation in this market.  Volumes declines in lining technology and drilling product sales comprise the remaining decrease.
Construction Technologies
:   Revenues increased $18.0 million to $71.8 million, of which 63% of the increase occurred in our domestic market.  Domestically, our well test and coil tubing services increased due to both increased demand and growth in our service capacity.  Internationally, our Malaysian operations increased revenues by $5.5 million largely as a result of winning several large contracts for the sale of service equipment.
Energy Services
  Revenues decreased primarily due to lower shipment volumes. Revenues continue to suffer from decreased supply of carriers and owner operators who are being recruited to oil and gas opportunities within the Bakken shale region.
Transportation:
  Gross profit remained stable at $62.2 million.  However, gross profit margin improvements in our Construction Technologies segment were offset by decreases in our Performance Materials and Energy Services segments.  This led to an overall 60 basis points decrease in gross profit margin to 26.0%.
Gross profit:
 
 
 
 
 
SG&A expenses increased $1.8 million, or 4.3%.  Excluding the one-time benefit of $1.1 million relating to the recovery of certain compensation related expenses, SG&A expenses would have increased by 6.9%, or $2.9 million.  The increase is largely reflective of $1.9 million of increased medical costs arising from several large claims within our domestic employee group.  In addition, approximately $1.2 million of the increase arises in our Energy Services segment and relates to certain expenses, such as travel and compensation expenses, which increased in support of increased sales growth activities.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A):
 
  Other, net decreased by approximately $0.9 million from the prior year quarter.  The current period includes $0.6 million of receivable write-offs related to the sale of our domestic contracting business that occurred in Q3 2011.
Other, net:
  The current periods effective tax rate is 24.7% or 980 basis points lower than the prior years quarter.  The two rates are different mostly due to changes in estimates concerning the geographical distribution of earnings that occurred in each quarter.  However, the effective tax rate for the year ending December 31, 2012 was comparable to the prior years rate.
Income tax expense:
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
The paragraphs in this section compare our balance sheet as of December 31, 2012 to that as of December 31, 2011.  We also make comparisons between cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.
Cash flow generated from operating activities increased $69.6 million largely due to improved management of non-cash working capital and greater net income.  We also paid down $12.3 million of long-term debt during the current period as opposed to borrowing $25.3 million in the prior year period.  Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization decreased 490 basis points to 34.8%.
Capital expenditures were $74.7 million as compared to $61.0 million in the prior year period.  Expenditures associated with our start-up chromite operations were $7.9 million and $8.2 million in the 2012 and 2011 periods, respectively.  In the current year, the majority of our capital spending occurred in our Energy Services and Performance Materials segments.
Dividends for 2012 increased 3.4% over the prior year period.  Our dividend rate increased 11.1% to $0.20 per share in the current quarter as compared to $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2011.
Announcement of Restatements
On January 23, 2013, AMCOLs Audit Committee, upon the recommendation of AMCOLs management, determined that AMCOLs audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011 and the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 need to be restated as a result of certain adjustments and should no longer be relied upon.  AMCOLs Form 10-K for the 2012 fiscal year, when filed, will reflect certain immaterial adjustments relating to the Supplemental Errors in AMCOLs 2012 second and third quarter results.
 
 
 
 
 
In January 2013, during the course of preparing to announce our 2012 fourth quarter earnings, we discovered certain errors in our previously issued financial statements related to our Construction Technologies segments European operations (collectively, the Supplemental Errors).  Note that in our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2012, we reported errors relating to the Spanish operations of our Construction Technologies segment as well as other immaterial errors which were not previously corrected prior to the filing of that Form 10-Q (the Initial Errors).
 
The following chart below reflects the extent to which the Supplemental Errors and the Initial Errors increase or (decrease) net income available to AMCOL shareholders (in millions) in each of the relevant periods:
 
 
In connection with the issues described above, we reevaluated the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2011 and for the three months ending March 31, 2012.

Explanatory Note: AMCOL International Corporation (the Company or AMCOL) is filing this Amendment to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 25, 2013 in order to provide additional information in Item 4.02 regarding the errors in our financial statements disclosed in the Form 8-K and to report on our conclusions regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures for the relevant periods.  This Form 8-K/A does not otherwise update or amend any exhibits as originally filed and does not otherwise reflect events occurring after the original filing date of the Form 8-K.
On January 23, 2013, our Audit Committee, upon the recommendation of management, determined that our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, and our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 need to be restated.  We also concluded that our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the three months ending March 31, 2012 should no longer be relied upon and thus we will file an amended Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 and an amended Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 as soon as possible.  The remaining paragraphs detail the events leading to these conclusions.
 
 
 
           Spain - $2.8 million decrease for errors associated with accounting for inventory and other items in our Environmental segments Spanish operations;
           South Africa - $0.8 million decrease for errors related to the accounting for the acquisition of mineral rights in our Minerals and Materials segments chromite operations in South Africa;
           Malaysia - $0.3 million increase resulting from correcting errors in our Oilfield Services segments Malaysian operations, largely relating to improper recognition of expenses and errors in accounting for revenues;
           DongMing  adjustments to correct errors made in accounting for accounts payable in this China subsidiary of our Minerals and Materials segment which have a cumulative non-impact;
           Tax - $0.2 increase resulting largely from inaccuracies in the accounting for income tax expense in our international operations; and
           $0.4 increase for other insignificant errors we have aggregated together.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In January 2013 and subsequent to filing our Forms 10-Q for the second and third quarters of 2012 and in preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2012, we discovered additional errors relating to prior periods (Supplemental Errors).  These Supplemental Errors relate to our accounting for long term contracts and bad debts within the European operations of our Environmental segment.
Regarding long term contracts, our cost estimates for ongoing projects to be completed were not updated and caused our calculation of the amounts to be recognized under the percentage of completion revenue recognition method to be incorrect.  These errors affected the accrued liabilities, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and related summation accounts (i.e. total current liabilities, total AMCOL shareholders equity, and total equity) within our balance sheets as well as the costs of sales and related ending summation accounts (i.e. gross profit, operating profit, income before income taxes and income (loss) from affiliates and joint ventures, income before income (loss) from affiliates and joint ventures, income (loss) from continuing operations, net income (loss), and net income (loss) attributable to AMCOL shareholders)  in our income statements.
With respect to the bad debts, our corporate office discovered information while preparing the 2012 fiscal year financial statements regarding receivables that caused us to believe the receivables were uncollectible.  We believe our European subsidiaries incorrectly concluded, in the prior periods when this information was known to them, that these debts were collectible.  These errors affected the accounts receivable, other long-term assets, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and related summation accounts (i.e. total current assets, total non-current assets, total assets, total AMCOL shareholders equity and total equity) accounts within our balance sheets as well as the selling, general & administrative expense and related summation accounts (i.e. operating profit, income before income taxes and income (loss) from affiliates and joint ventures, income before income (loss) from affiliates and joint ventures, income (loss) from continuing operations, net income (loss), and net income (loss) attributable to AMCOL shareholders) in our income statements.
Upon the discovery of these Supplemental Errors in January 2013, we assessed the materiality of the Supplemental Errors in combination with the Initial Errors.  We concluded that these errors were individually and collectively immaterial to 2010 and prior years.  However, for the year ended December 31, 2011 we concluded that the cumulative effect of correcting these errors in 2011 is material to those financial statements.  Thus, we concluded that the audited financial statements relating to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 need to be restated.  We also concluded that our financial statements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 can no longer be relied upon. Moreover, since these errors were not corrected as of March 31, 2012, we concluded that the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2012 also need to be restated and can no longer be relied upon.
 
 
 
The chart below reflects the extent to which the Supplemental Errors and the Initial Errors increase or (decrease) net income available to AMCOL shareholders ($ in millions).
 
 
We will correct the Initial Errors and Supplemental Errors by amending our Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 and the Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2012.
Since the Initial Errors were corrected in our Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2012 and September 30, 2012, we concluded that the financial statements included in those reports are not materially misstated for the uncorrected Supplemental Errors.  However, we will correct our 2012 second and third quarter results when we include them in our 2012 Form 10-K.
We reassessed our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and of our disclosure controls and procedures for the year ended December 31, 2011 and for the three months ended March 31, 2012.  We determined that a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012 due to a lack of financial oversight of our Environmental segments operations in Europe.  Because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012. We will report these conclusions and our remediation plans in the amended Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.
 
 
 
Our management and our Audit Committee have discussed the matters disclosed in this Item 4.02 with Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm.

As previously disclosed by AMCOL International Corporation (AMCOL) in its Form 12b-25 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2013, AMCOL delayed the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 (the 2012 10-K) pending completion of the restatement of its audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, and its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2012.  The 2012 10-K will be delayed beyond the extended due date available pursuant to Rule 12b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, March 16, 2013 (the Filing Due Date). AMCOL expects to file its 2012 10-K as soon as reasonably possible.
 
On March 22, 2013, AMCOL issued a press release disclosing its March 19, 2013 receipt of correspondence from NYSE Regulation, Inc. informing AMCOL that, as a result of its failure to file the 2012 10-K by the Filing Due Date, AMCOL is not currently in compliance with the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and is subject to certain procedures as specified in Section 802.01E, SEC Annual Report Timely Filing Criteria, of the NYSEs Listed Company Manual. Such noncompliance is based on AMCOLs failure to timely file the 2012 10-K.  In accordance with the NYSEs procedures, AMCOL is required to contact the NYSE to discuss the status of the 2012 10-K and to issue a press release pertaining to the late filing by the fifth business day following the receipt of the NYSE notification. AMCOL has contacted the NYSE to inform them of the filing status and has issued the press release within the five day period.  AMCOL has six months from the Filing Due Date to cure this deficiency.  AMCOL can regain compliance at any time during this six-month cure period once it files its 2012 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In the event that AMCOL has failed to cure the deficiency by the expiration of the six-month cure period, the NYSE may grant, at its discretion, a further extension of up to six months trading period, depending on the specific circumstances.
 
AMCOLs common stock remains listed on the NYSE under the symbol ACO, but will be assigned an LF indicator by the NYSE to signify AMCOLs late filing status.
 
A copy of AMCOLs press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is hereby incorporated by reference.

AMCOL International Provides Update on Late Filing of Its 2012 Annual Report - 10-K
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwire - March 22, 2013) - AMCOL International (NYSE: ) previously reported that its Audit Committee, upon the recommendation of management, determined that the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 need to be restated due to certain errors in their previously issued financial statements.

ACO
 
AMCOL International also previously reported that pending the completion of these restatements, they are unable to complete the preparation of their Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
 
AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) Reports First Quarter Results
 
HOFFMAN ESTATES, IL--(Marketwired - April 25, 2013) - For the first quarter of 2013, AMCOL International Corporation (NYSE: ACO) generated diluted earnings attributable to its shareholders from continuing operations of $0.32 per share versus $0.41 per share in the prior year's quarter. The 2013 quarter includes $0.08 per share of reorganization expenses and $0.02 per share of increased expenses associated with amending certain SEC filings. 
 
Net sales increased $1.2 million to $236.7 million in the 2013 first quarter, and gross profit decreased $1.6 million to $63.1 million. Gross profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 26.7%. Operating profit decreased 23.8% to $16.3 million, and operating profit margin decreased 220 basis points to 6.9%. SG&A expenses increased $3.5 million to $46.8 million and include $2.2 million of reorganization expenses, largely in our construction technologies segment, and $1.0 million of increased expenses in our corporate segment related to amending certain SEC filings. 
 
Other, net is comprised of expenses which decreased by $1.4 million as the prior year period includes $1.8 million of losses on certain non-operating assets. Our effective tax rate for the 2013 first quarter was 27.5% compared to 26.5% in the prior year period. 
 
"We continued to see solid results from energy services which were offset by continued softness in several end markets in our performance materials and construction technologies segments," said AMCOL President and CEO Ryan McKendrick.
 
"Sales and gross margin declined in performance materials as compared to Q1 2012. Lower sales of drilling fluids were the primary driver for the decline, but we are now seeing a gradual increase in demand developing. The decline in specialty materials sales reflects the discontinuation of our paper related products as well as lower demand in fabric care and industrial products. While we had some softness in pet products, we have secured additional volume for this product line which should improve performance starting in Q2," McKendrick continued.
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Our construction technologies segment's sales declined primarily as a result of lower sales for our lining technologies products both domestically and in Europe. Gross margin for the segment continued to exceed 30% due to our actions to reduce manufacturing costs. SG&A for the segment included $1.7 million of non-recurring expenses associated with closing or reorganizing several European office locations. These actions will continue into the second quarter. The outlook for the lining technologies business is improving in the near term as we have secured new orders for our products that contain recently developed, proprietary technology," McKendrick added.
 
McKendrick continued, "Our energy services segment achieved record revenue for the quarter. The majority of the revenue increase was driven by domestic business as our three largest domestic service areas -- coil tubing, well testing, and water treatment -- all showed nice increases. We also experienced strong growth in our domestic nitrogen business. Globally, our specialized water treatment technology contributed the largest share of the growth. International locations continue to perform in line with our expectations."
 
"In summary, as we enter the middle part of the year, we continue to be confident in the fundamentals for our business. We will continue to execute our strategy for investment in growth opportunities while reorganizing or exiting those business units that do not fit our strategic and performance objectives," he concluded.
 
STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The statement of operations highlights are supported by the quarterly segment results schedules included in this press release. The following comments relate to our results for the current quarter as compared to the same quarter in the prior year, unless otherwise noted.
 
 Net sales increased $1.2 million as increases in our energy services segment were dampened by decreases in our performance materials and construction technologies segments.
Net sales:
 
: Sales decreased 6.4% mostly due to activities in our domestic and European markets. Domestically, we experienced sales declines principally in our drilling fluid additives and specialty materials products as previously highlighted. In Europe, our largest fabric care customer purchased less product, resulting in the decrease in specialty materials product line sales.
Performance Materials
 
: Sales in this segment decreased 16.1% mainly due to activities in our domestic and European markets, especially in our lining technologies and contracting services product lines. Lining technologies sales suffered from unfavorable weather patterns. Contracting services revenues continue to decline in line with our strategy to reduce our participation in this market. 
Construction Technologies
 
 
 
 
 
: Revenues increased 32.2% to $73.1 million, 84% of which was derived in our domestic market. Domestically, our coil tubing, water treatment, well testing, and nitrogen services are benefitting from increased demand as well as capacity due to equipment and related personnel we recently put into service. Revenues from our international operations increased 25% largely due to increased revenues to construct service equipment under contract with certain customers of our Malaysian operations.
Energy Services
 
 Gross profit decreased $1.6 million due to the decrease in gross profit margin in our performance materials and energy services segments. In our energy services segment, gross profit margins decreased as a result of increased concentration of land based revenues, especially in our coil tubing operations, and decreased profitability of certain services where we added equipment and personnel but have not yet generated increased revenues. In our performance materials segment, the decrease in sales, especially in our domestic market, was the overriding factor leading to the lower gross profit margins for this segment.
Gross profit:
 
 SG&A expenses increased $3.5 million, or 8.1%. Notable increases include $2.2 million of reorganization expenses, mostly within our construction technologies segment, and $1.0 million of expenses associated with amending certain SEC filings. In addition, the 2012 period includes unusual expenses of $0.7 million to write off certain information technology assets in our corporate segment as well as $1.3 million of bad debt expenses for one customer in our energy services segment. Excluding all these aforementioned expenses, SG&A expenses increased $2.3 million from $41.3 million in 2012 to $43.6 million in 2013. The $2.3 million increase is mostly comprised of increased compensation and benefit expenses.
Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A):
 
 Other, net expenses decreased by approximately $1.4 million from the prior year quarter, which also included $1.8 million of losses on certain non-operating assets.
Other, net:
 
 The current period's effective tax rate is 27.5% or 100 basis points greater than the prior year's quarter. The two rates are different mostly due to changes in estimates related to our foreign earnings that occurred each quarter.
Income tax expense:
 
FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS:
 
The paragraphs in this section compare our balance sheet as of March 31, 2013 to that as of December 31, 2012. We also make comparisons between cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012.
 
Cash flow generated from operating activities decreased $3.6 million and primarily reflects the $3.1 million decrease in net income. The 2013 quarter also includes increased capital expenditures ($6.0 million) and an investment we made in Novinda ($5.0 million). These factors gave rise to the $13.0 million of incremental debt borrowed as compared to the prior year's period. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization increased 40 basis points to 35.3%. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dividends paid increased 14.0% over the prior year period. Our dividend rate increased 11.1% to $0.20 per share in the current quarter as compared to $0.18 in the first quarter of 2012.
