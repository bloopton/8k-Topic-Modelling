ITEM: Regulation FD Disclosure
 
Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure.
On April 1, 2003 during the Astec Industries, Inc. (the "Company") investor conference call, the Company's Chief Executive Officer erroneously stated that the Company's Atlanta airport project had generated revenues between $7 million and $8 million during the fourth quarter of 2002. The actual revenue generated by the Atlanta airport project during the fourth quarter of 2002 was $3.7 million.
During the Company's investor conference call of April 1, 2003 the Company's Chief Financial Officer erroneously stated that the Company's ConExpo trade show expenses for 2002 were $706,000. In fact, the Company's ConExpo trade show expenses for 2002 were $963,000. He also stated that Selling, General and Administrative expenses excluding excess bank fees and ConExpo expenses, was 14.7% of Net Sales. The Company's Selling, General and Administrative expenses, after excluding excess bank fees and the corrected total of ConExpo expenses, was actually 16.1% of Net Sales.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (April 1, 2003) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2002 in line with its revised guidance issued on February 28, 2003.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2002 were $105.4 million compared with $83.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2001. Domestic sales accounted for 82.7% and international sales 17.3% of the revenues during the fourth quarter. The Company reported a net loss of $10.3 million, or $0.52 per fully diluted share, for the fourth quarter compared with a net loss of $6.9 million, or $0.35 per fully diluted share, for the prior year. The net loss for the fourth quarter was within the range of expectations given by the Company in its February 28, 2003 press release.
Revenues for 2002 were $480.6 million compared with $455.8 million for 2001. Domestic sales accounted for 83.5% in 2002 versus 79.9% in 2001 and international sales 16.5% for 2002 versus 20.1% for 2001. The Company reported a net loss of $4.7 million, or $0.24 per fully diluted share, for 2002 compared with a net income of $2.0 million, or $.10 per fully diluted share, for the prior year.
Consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2002 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Astec's backlog at January 31, 2003, was $65.6 million compared with $75.4 million at January 31, 2002, restated for its July 1, 2002 strategic alliance with Case Construction Equipment.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "As I mentioned in our February 28, 2003 press release, even though revenues showed an increase over the fourth quarter 2001 revenues, we are very disappointed in the lack of earnings performance in the fourth quarter. One of the primary factors in the fourth quarter that caused our earnings results to be well below our expectations was negative gross profits on certain highly specialized and customized Astec Systems' projects completed during the fourth quarter. The negative gross profits resulted primarily from cost overruns on the construction and installation phases of the projects. These projects have not been profitable, but on the positive side, they have introduced many of our standard products to new customers. Other factors that caused our results to be far below expectations include under-utilization of capacity and inventory write-downs on rental and used equipment to reflect the dec reased market value for such equipment due to poor economic conditions." Dr. Brock added, "the fourth quarter costs related to the relocation and manufacturing start-up of the Trencor and Case product lines in Loudon, Tennessee were in line with our expectations."
The following forecast is a compilation of "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this press release.
Outlook for First Quarter of 2003:
The Company is focused on delivering improved results over the long term and has made a policy change with regard to providing future earnings guidance. In the future, the Company will no longer provide any quarterly or annual earnings per share guidance. The Company will continue, however, to provide investors with perspective on key components influencing earnings, its strategic initiatives and those factors critical to understanding its business and operating environment.
Commenting on the Company's outlook for the first quarter of 2003, Dr. Brock stated, "Based on American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Report (AASHTO), the level of highway investments needs to increase by 42% (from $65 billion to $92 billion) annually to keep highways in their current condition, including keeping traffic congestion from getting worse. Also according to the report, it would take $128 billion annually to improve significantly overall conditions of the nation's highways. The need for infrastructure improvements both domestically and internationally is huge. With industry-leading technology and available capacity, we believe Astec should benefit from the expected upturn in our markets."

THE OPERATOR:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Astec Industries fourth-quarter and year-end conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief Q&A session will follow the formal presentation. (CALLER INSTRUCTIONS). This conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and CEO of Astec Industries.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
Good morning, everyone. With me on the call -- I am in Morris, Minnesota, and with me is Bob Stafford, who is our Group Vice President of Aggregates; and in Chattanooga, Tennessee is McKamy Hall, our CFO, Al Guth, our Group Vice President of Administration, and Steve Anderson, who is our Assistant Secretary and Director of Investor Relations. To start the call, I would like to ask Steve to make a brief statement.
STEPHEN C. ANDERSON:
Before we begin, I'm sure that all of you have had a chance to read and digest the press release that we issued at 7:00 this morning, which gives details on the fourth-quarter and year-end. I do want to remind you that our discussion this morning will contain forward-looking statements relating to the future performance of the Company. These statements are intended to qualify for the safe harbor liability standards by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the press release that we issued earlier today. These comments that we will make during the conference call are commentary, and our answers to your questions are as well. Some of those factors that could influence our results are highlighted in today's pres s release, and others are contained in our annual report, our filings with the SEC on both a quarterly and annual basis, including the 10-K filed yesterday. Naturally, we urge you to familiarize yourself with those risk factors before making investment decisions regarding Astec Industries, Inc. At this point, I would like to turn the call back over to Don Brock.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
What we would like to do is briefly talk about the year 2002, and I am going to ask McKamy to go through some results, and then we will talk about the outlook for the rest of 2003. Before McKamy gives us the financial results, I would like to just mention our four operating groups -- the asphalt, the aggregate, mobile, and underground groups basically make up our company. We have 14 different divisions. If you look at each of the companies last year, we experienced a very tough economy, very competitive business; the volume was -- I guess in overall we had a lack of volume in the business, and as a result, the volume that was there was very competitive. The asphalt area was poor, primarily due to construction projects related to our Systems Group, which I will talk about a little later. The Aggregate Group, again, had a reasonable year, but not great. And our Mobile group was our best performer of the three. In the Underground end of it, we continue to live in a depressed cy cle, very depressed due to the telecom business, and was not helped a whole lot by the regular utility business or the pipeline business. But with that, I would like to ask McKamy to go through our financial results, and to cover some of the points related to the balance sheet of the Company.
MR. McKAMY HALL:
We are pleased to share with you that the Company has received covenant waivers for 12/31, 2002, and for 3/31, 2003. The covenants for the remainder of 2003 have been renegotiated based on current expectations. The Company filed timely the 10-K yesterday. The Company has generated $22 million from Astec Financial sales of portfolios. The remaining portfolio sale should bring the escrow account to a level of approximately $30 million. Our current creditors understand that some of the funds may be needed to assist the Company through the second quarter and peak season, to fund normal seasonal needs. The funds remaining in the escrow should be available to reduce current debt during a refinancing or further restructuring of our current debt. During the first-quarter, the Company received and evaluated several refinancing proposals. The Company is currently pursuing one source, and good progress has been made toward execution of the refinancing. Auditors are on-site and appraisa ls are in process.
Now, I would like to share some of the financial numbers with you, and then after this and after further comments from Don, I will certainly be glad to answer any questions you may have. I am going to try to not bore you with reading a lot of the things that are attached to the press release; I will refer to some of those, but I will try to share some things with you that will help you better understand the financials that we have provided in the press release. In the first quarter -- I'm sorry, in the fourth-quarter, the sales are up 27 percent, or $22.3 million. International sales were at $18.2 million versus the prior year of $16.3, or an 11.5 percent increase. The parts sales were up from $20.5 million to $23.9 million, or a 16.6 percent increase in the fourth-quarter. Addressing sales for the year, our revenues are up from $455.8 million to $480.6 million, for an increase of 5.4 percent. The international sales decreased by 13.2 percent, and this decline primarily occurred in Central America and Europe. The domestic sales increased from $364,428,000 in 2001 to $410,284,000 in 2002, or $36,856,000, for a 10.1 percent increase. Parts sales were up from $93.5 million to $99.8 million, or 6.7 percent. During the year, the percentage of revenues by segment in a pie chart reporting format would be -- Asphalt at 34.5 percent of our total sales, and the sales increased in that segment; Aggregate, 41.5 percent of total sales, sales increased in that segment; Mobile, 15.0 percent, and the sales declined in that segment; Underground, 8.2 percent, and sales declined in that segment. Now, sales by segment is in the sheet attached to the press release. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter had a decline of $4.5 million. As we announced in our pre-release, and further reiterated yesterday, this was a result of several factors -- including the underutilization of capacity; cost overruns on customized jobs and used equipment write-downs. For the year, we also had significant underutilization of capa city, competitive price pressures -- which Don referred to a second ago -- decreased sales volume, particularly in Underground; cost overruns on Systems projects, and particularly in the construction and erection phase; and the used equipment write-downs that I referred to in the quarterly context. In terms of the ranking of the segments by gross margin, that information is attached to your press release, so I will not repeat that. Only one comment relating to the rankings, as Don mentioned a while ago -- the Asphalt Group -- and some people don't understand this -- but the Asphalt Group has basically done the construction and erection phase of our aggregate systems jobs, or the Astec Systems jobs, so some of the losses or overruns that did occur did impact the gross margin of the Asphalt Group. So I just wanted you to be aware of that.
In the SG&A and engineering area, looking at the quarter, we were at 17.9 percent versus 25.2 percent. If you've had a chance to study the income statement, you should notice that the startup and relocation expenses for the Loudon plant, or the Trencor and Case New Holland product lines, totaling $3,277,000, are on a separate line. So that is excluded from the SG&A cost and spelled out because of its large expenditure.
On the year-to-date basis, for the year of 2002, the SG&A and engineering was at 16.7 percent compared to 17.4 percent. If you further analyze that -- and we have comments in our annual report -- we tell you that the bank fees were $750,000, and ConExpo expenses were $706,000. If those two items were excluded from the 16.7 percent of SG&A for 2002, that would reduce the percentage to 14.7 percent, so you would be comparing the prior year of 17.4 to 14.7.
The income by segment is also attached to your press release, and I will not reread that to you. Interest expenses for the quarter are at 2.6 versus 2.7 last year. For the year, we are at 10.5 versus 9.4. And that has been significantly impacted by interest surcharges to the tune of about $1.6 million in 2002. So there would have definitely been a reduction there, but for the interest surcharge increases.
The other income for the year of 2002 is at 2.7 versus 1.2, and this is primarily the result of the sale of Astec portfolios in 2002. Our net loss for the quarter was 52 cents a share, as opposed to 35 cents a share last year. Our net loss for the year is at 24 cents versus a profit of 10 cents last year. The sheet attached also provides for you the changes in the segment gross profit, and I will not read all of those to you. The backlog at December was $60.7 million versus $70.1 million, or $9.0 million dollars less, or 13 percent.
I will share with you the backlog by segment. I do not believe we have disclosed that anywhere. In the Asphalt Group at 2002, it was $26.6 million, and that is a reduction of 15 percent; the Mobile Asphalt Paving was $2.5 million -- was an increase of 113 percent; the Aggregate and Mining was at $24.4 million -- was a reduction of 8 percent; and the Underground was at 7.2, with a reduction of 35 percent. On the balance sheet, the receivables are up $7.9 million. That is primarily accounted for by Astec Financial receivables. As I mentioned earlier, we still do have approximately $8 million of that portfolio to be sold, so this will have an additional positive influence on that number.
Our days outstanding at 12/31 were 45 versus 61 days for the prior year. Inventory was at 120 million -- 120.2 million versus 129 for the prior year. The debt was at 133.9 million versus 129.7 million. As you are aware, those of you that follow the company closely, you know we are in a position with our current lenders where we do not want to make any reductions -- permanent reductions -- in our debt levels, so we are carrying a lot of cash that would otherwise be applied to reducing the debt. The IRB portion of that $133.9 million is $19.2 million.
Our capital expenditures for 2003 were $19.3 million, and that includes the acquisition of the John Deere building and property at Loudon, Tennessee, which we had hoped to do a tax-free swap on, which did not materialize and we will discuss more later, so we ended up with capital expenditures of $19.3 million, and with depreciation of 15.1; now, that broken down a little further is actually 12.9 on PP&E and $2.2 million on Astec Financial operating leases. So the 12.9 number is the number that we should keep in mind when comparing to the projections for 2003, and we are projecting that number at $13 million. We basically have, other than completing the Loudon facility -- which will be a relatively small amount of capital expenditures -- we basically have our capital expenditures on hold, and would definitely not expect those to exceed $5 million, but maybe not even reach $5 million, based on our current policy.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will certainly be glad to answer any questions later. Don.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
Just a few other comments related to last year. We decided a couple of years ago to try to become a systems integrator in our aggregate business. In the asphalt business, we kind of grew into that market by building every piece of a complete asphalt plant facility, from the plant itself to the heating equipment to the erection of the plant, the delivery of the plant, the startup, controls and the entire system, where we could offer our customer a complete package.
Others in the industry offer components, and with probably one or two exceptions, there are only a couple that can offer the complete package that we do. And really, if you look at everything, there is no one there that offers the depth that we have and the variety of product.
In our aggregate group, with the seven different manufacturing companies, each of which had certain specialties, we really did not have an integrator. So we formed an engineering group to do that, to basically pull components -- crushers, conveyors, screens, other components -- from the different companies and to integrate them into a complete system. We believe that this strategy is correct. We believe that we intend to stay in this area. But we have had problems of mis-estimating, and I take considerable credit in this area and the construction side of it.
We utilized the asphalt construction crews to do that, which were somewhat unfamiliar with the equipment. And also, it was larger projects than we had historically handled. As a result, last year this cost us about $3 million in earnings. One of these projects was approximately an $18 million project at the Atlanta airport. Frankly, it was equipment that is larger than any of us had built before. We tended to over design it; as a result, it is functioning extremely well.
On these systems you are faced with pouring the concrete, erecting the equipment, delivering it to the site, getting it up, doing the electrical, doing the startup and then doing the shakedown. We were faced at the end of the year with some terrible weather, had a lot of erection cost overruns that we did not expect, and while we think that this -- bringing the products of all the companies, integrating them together -- is a proper strategy, we are refocusing on outsourcing the construction and the erection of it and doing what we do best, and we believe that this will continue to be a good business for us or grow into a good business for us.
The second area that we have faced problems in is in our Underground -- two Underground companies, American Augers and Trencor. The telecom business, as all of you know, just plummeted about 2.5 years ago. Directional drill business is off approximately 90 percent from its peak. Fortunately, these two companies were in the larger end of the business, and still, the large end of it is not too bad, but the small end has been terrible.
In an effort to fix these problems, we entered into a strategic alliance with Case New Holland about midyear, to build their small line of trenchers, which are used primarily more in the utility business for water lines, sewer lines, gas lines. It is a higher-volume, smaller-end of the business. The major two things that it brought with us was the availability of distribution, tieing into some of their purchasing, and we felt like that this was a -- would allow us to sell the small end of the Trencor and American Auger trenchers and directional drills that we were not doing very well with.
Concurrent with this, our first strategy was to move it into our Grapevine, Texas, facility, but we were offered -- the property in Grapevine has increased significantly. A new Opryland hotel is being built across the street from it. And a developer offered us $24 million for the property. Also, concurrent with this, a large, relatively new plant, approximately four years old, in Loudon, Tennessee, about 70 miles from our home office, became available. This was a plant that had been built by John Deere to manufacture their skid steer loaders. It was a state-of-the-art plant for building small, high-volume products, and we acquired that plant; and basically it was all to be cash neutral funded by the sale of the Trencor property, which we should have netted around $20 million for from after-tax. Unfortunately, everything took place except the sale of the Trencor property. We've mentioned this previous, that the developer was unable to come up with his financing at the last moment, and as a result, this -- combination of all of this increased our debt approximately $20 million. We have proceeded with moving the Case line into the Loudon, Tennessee plant. We have moved a significant part of Trencor. We slowed down the move of Trencor, obviously, when the building did not sell, and should complete that move by the end of the second quarter with the Trencor equipment as the business picks up in that particular area. We are up to speed on the manufacturing of the Case products, have built over 100 of the products now during the first quarter, and are driving our cost down as we get more experience. We believe that this is, and continues to be a good plan, but unfortunately, the way it has turned out, our timing could not have been worse. It is basically increased our debt, as I mentioned, approximately $20 million.
Also, with the violation of the covenants starting in the fourth quarter of 2001, and the increase in our interest rates, our finance company became uncompetitive. It also brought about additional leverage to the Company. And as mentioned previously, we chose to close the finance company in the fourth quarter of last year, and will reduce our debt, as we sell off the last of the portfolio, approximately $30 million. I should point out that there's a number of onetime events that we are tangled up in here, and one is the restructuring of our debt and being able to pay down the debt from the proceeds of the sale of the portfolio, approximately $30 million. The sale of the Trencor property will pay down debt another $20 million. And also, as we mentioned at our last conference call, we have made a significant reduction in expenses. We started in the fourth quarter of last year, and that work continues. With the restructuring of our debt, as McKamy mentioned -- when that is complete, we will h ave significantly less debt and less interest, and should put the Company back on sound footing from our balance sheet standpoint. Going forward, the underground business, we believe, we'll have up to speed by midyear. We have a number of prospects on the sale of the Trencor property, but it is not sold at this point. In January of '04, we will pick up the parts business related to the Case line, and so in '04, that will add about $12 million of additional parts to the $100 million in parts business that we have. This year, as many of you know, the appropriations bill did not pass until the end of February. While there was continuing resolutions, there was continuing nervousness about what the level of the highway funding would be. And basically, it ended up being the same as last year. But due to the nervousness, the obligations during January and February were off 60 percent from last year. As a result, we found our customers to be reluctant to spend; everybody seemed to be in kind of a wait and see attitu de. Highway departments of transportation were reluctant to let jobs, and we kind of saw the first quarter being slower than normal, but see that there is beginning to be a pick up for the second quarter. It seems like with the number of uncertainties, the cyclic part of the year seems to be moving out. We continued to work with the other -- with our customers and other members of the industry to work on the new authorization bill, which well come up in September. It appears that the funding will be -- we believe it will be increased somewhat. There is speculation that it will be in the $35 to $60 billion range. I think 60 is optimistic, but I would say it is going to be from our existing level of $31 billion up to in the $40 billion range. The non-binding -- which it's certainly non-binding -- budget resolution passed in the Senate yesterday was for $255 billion over six years, which averages about $42 billion a year. So there are a lot of numbers being thrown around as far the level -- what level that will be. We continued to refocus on our core business. We believe we have got the strongest product lines in the business. We have the leading technology. We have the highest market share in about each of the segments that we participate in. We certainly have the best service, and we have a very strong balance sheet. While last year was very tough, we did continue to develop products. In our Aggregate Group, we developed a new portable crushing plant that is high production, in the 500 ton an hour range; it can be installed in less than four hours. We have developed a new burner system, a new control system in the asphalt side of it, a number of new machines in our Roadtec division, and are continuing to press product development in the Underground division. As I said, the last six months and all of last year, there has been a lot of uncertainties. We probably experienced the worst winter, our customers did, that we have seen in years with poor weather. The Venezuelan oil situation has certainly affected the asp halt side of the business, since a lot of the liquid asphalt -- especially on the East Coast -- is generated from Venezuelan crude. And with the disruption of the supply down there, it caused a spike in prices, particularly on the East Coast. Also, states have been short on funding. We see with the existing highway bill that was passed for this year -- the appropriations in the new highway bill -- that states will make sure that they come up with matching funds. The Iraqi situation, obviously, affects the attitude of people with a wait and see, but we believe that as that passes, the optimism -- we think everything is in place for the market to turn. As I said, while we expect the market to remain weak in 2003, we believe that we will come out of the recession much stronger and a much better company and stronger market shares. We have the best names in the industry that we serve, the lowest operating cost and highest technology equipment, the best service, and most importantly, we have the most loyal custome r base. With that, I will stop, and we would be glad to take any questions that you have at this time.

This is John Riley for Arnie Ursaner at CJS. I would like to review a couple of things that you said about updating us on the sale of your Trencor facility. Could you give us what you think of the timing and the size of the sale will likely be?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
We believe that we probably were at the top of the market, in the $24-25 million range, where it was. We have done a number of surveys out there, and some properties there are selling at that number and some are selling somewhat less than that number. Steve Anderson and I are going to Dallas tomorrow to meet with one developer. We have two or three people talking about it. We believe that we will get it sold this year, but to say for sure and when -- probably the ideal timing will be a year from now, when Opryland Hotel opens up. But we would prefer not to wait that long. The amount that we get out of it -- it's going to be, we believe, somewhere within the 20 percent of that range, I would say.
THE CALLER:
Still focusing on the facilities -- could you give us what you look for on the relocation and startup expenses for the rest of this year?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
We ended up spending about $3.5 million in the fourth quarter moving. Part of my hesitation in that is there is part of the building at Trencor -- real heavy bay at Trencor that we can either move or not move that will affect some of that relocation expense, and we are waiting to see what the buyer really wants when we sell it. To answer your question, we don't see a lot more expense from this point forward. Ramping up at Loudon is going fairly well. During the first two months of the first equipment getting up to speed, obviously, the man-hours were higher than we expected, but they seem to be leveling out in March. We have a good backlog of orders for the small trenchers, but my best ballpark would be another million to $1.5 million of additional expenses during this year.
THE CALLER:
Could you give us an update on what you are seeing in the competitive landscape? Have any of your competitors fallen under even harder times?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
Yes. It's extremely competitive, and I think the fortunate thing that we have is 75-80 percent of our business is repeat customers. The other thing that we are seeing is people who were not our customers are coming to us, because we do have a reputation for taking care of our products, and for giving good service. These products that we build somewhat have umbilical cords for a long time. The control systems that are used on these plants require service and require backup, and they require good parts. This equipment, as we mentioned earlier -- we have got $100 million, or about 20 percent of our business is in parts. So they get worried about being able to get parts and service, and as a result, we are seeing more customers that were not our classic customers coming to us this year than we have seen before.
THE OPERATOR:
Michael Braig with AG Edwards.
THE CALLER:
I wonder if I could ask a question on profit allocation? I think in the past, you have said that when you sell an operating lease that is the point at which the manufacturing profit is recognized?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
That is correct.
THE CALLER:
Does that go into the "all other" category, which I understand to include finance operation, or does the profit on manufacturing revert back to the actual sector in which it was built?
COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE:
The sector in which it was built.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
But it occurs at the time that we sell the lease.
THE CALLER:
Question on the used equipment inventory write-down -- was that concentrated in any one segment?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
The inventory write-downs have been primarily in the Asphalt, Mobile, and some in the Underground. We do a lot of -- one of the things that we have tried to do is create an unfair advantage over our competition. As a result, in both the Mobile and the Asphalt group, we have got used equipment departments. And as a vehicle for creating sales, we do a lot of horse trading or taking used equipment in trade. Our used equipment inventories were high at the end of the year, and we have brought those down pretty significant, that you will see after the first quarter numbers are out. We continue to take trades, but what we saw is some of the trades that we had taken early -- late 2001 and 2002, as the market deteriorated, so did the value of those deteriorate; and rather than sit there with them waiting for the market to come back, we chose to go ahead and take the lick and write them down to market.
MR. McKAMY HALL:
Let me add a little bit of clarification to what Don said. I don't want you to think we have got an overall problem there, or a policy problem. There were no asphalt write-downs. It was in Mobile and Underground. That is a reflection of the market, as Don just said.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
I might point out too, on the asphalt plant equipment particularly, oftentimes we take in an asphalt plant and we use the word piecemeal it out. Sometimes the entire plant may have had new components added to it -- such as baghouses, hot storage bins, various things -- and we can get more for the pieces than we get for the complete plant. As we do that, we basically are very conservative. We take no profit until we have got all of the money out of it, and the last piece was the one we make the profit on.
THE CALLER:
There was mention of an escrow. I don't recall that word being used previously. Can you define how that relates to your lending agreement, if indeed that is the tie?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
McKamy, you want to --
MR. MCKAMY HALL:
In our original loan agreement, when we had a sale -- the way the legal definition reads is that when we are doing something other than normal course of business, once we decided to close Astec Financial, then the legal agreement portrayed the sale of portfolios after that date to be other than normal course of business. So all of that money that has been raised from the sale of portfolios has been put into an escrow account with the banks. We do not have access to that, but we have the right to ask the lenders to use that money. They are aware, as I said, that we may need to use some of that money through our peak season. That is our money, it will be available to reduce the debt during the refinancing or restructuring. And that should approximate about $30 million; it is currently at about $22 million. But when we finish the last portfolio sale, it should approximate $30 million. Does that sufficiently cover it?
THE CALLER:
I think I understand it.
THE OPERATOR:
Jack Kasprzak with BB&T Capital Markets.
THE CALLER:
On SG&A, which was about $80 million for the year -- McKamy, you mentioned a couple of items that totaled about $1.5 million that, I guess, were "one time" in nature. Can we assume, then, that $78.5 million is sort of same on/same run rate of SG&A? And if so, would you think that that for 2003 on a dollar basis be up or down?
MR. McKAMY HALL:
We would expect that based on the cuts that we have put in place at the end of the third quarter of 2002, and I guess that 100 percent will be in-place by today. We would expect that to decline, and that's what our goal is.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
Our goal was to try to take that down to about 72, but we have been hit with some additional costs related to insurance. As you know, the insurance market is terrible, so we have had increases in that area; but we have made some pretty significant decreases.
MR. McKAMY HALL:
The other thing I should say, that during the first quarter and possibly some into the second, we will have some expenses relating to requirements of the current BankGroup that will have some impact on that, but the ongoing normal expenses should decline.
THE CALLER:
Okay. And the inventory write-down that's mentioned in the press release that, Don, you were just talking about -- can you quantify that, or have you quantified that?
MR. McKAMY HALL:
That was $1,600,000.
THE CALLER:
So I think you guys earlier in your comments that the cost overruns and problems with some of the Systems jobs you had in 2002 cost you $3 million in earnings. I assume that's all-inclusive.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
That's correct.
THE CALLER:
And then you have $1.6 million of an inventory write-down, and then you have 3. -- almost $3 million from the relocation expenses.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
That is more like $3.3 to $3.5 million.
THE CALLER:
Okay. And, obviously, the underutilization of capacity is probably difficult to quantify and is ongoing, so it would be recurring in this environment. But we add that up, and you are at almost $8 million of non-recurring costs; and I know there are going to be some offsets, like maybe another $1 million related to the Trencor situation, but would you think that just from having some of these problems behind you and write-downs behind you, that gross profit would bounce back in the $5-$7 million range, all else being equal?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
I believe so. We should, once we get through our restructuring of our bank debt, have a pretty significant reduction there.
THE CALLER:
Any comments or guidance you can give on when that restructuring might be closed?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
We plan for it to be done during the early part of the second quarter.
THE OPERATOR:
John Franzreb with Sidoti & Company.
THE CALLER:
You spent some time talking about the public sector and the financing that is going on. J. Don, can you kind of update us on what is going on in the private sector? It is a more profitable business for you. What's the outlook there?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
Outlook there is -- this strictly goes with the economy. Until this Iraq situation is settled and optimism picks up, I think everybody is kind of paralyzed in that area. Our customers are predominantly living on state and federal highway work, and that's pretty good. I talked with one of our largest customers yesterday and he said that part of the business is okay, it's just the commercial side that is still slow. The other side that is fairly strong is the home-building, which would be subdivisions and development there; but large shopping centers, parking lots, things like that, development projects, are almost non-existent right now. And that is going to wait on the general economy. I don't know any other way to put it.
THE CALLER:
In regards to the aggregate side of the business, what are your customers like Martin Marietta telling you? Some feedback on that side?
COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE:
Both Martin Marietta and Vulcan -- you know their numbers as well as what their plans are as well as we do -- but they seem to be really holding back on a lot of capital expenditures. Frankly, we see a little more of what I would call -- there has been a lot of effort to -- of the larger companies to make acquisitions in both aggregate and asphalt. We see them in a digestion period of trying to digest what they have acquired. Most of our business today is to the privately-owned companies, and they are doing okay. If you really look in the asphalt and the aggregate side, the privately-helped companies that did not have a whole lot of debt are continuing to buy and spend money.
THE CALLER:
How much revenue in the fourth quarter was actually directly related to the Atlanta project?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
I'm not sure I can answer that one.
MR. MCKAMY HALL:
I can't either, Don, right now.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
My ballpark would have been about $7-$8 million, but it was the bad end of it -- it was the final construction of it.
THE OPERATOR:
Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'm sorry; we have one more question, from Michael Braig with AG Edwards.
THE CALLER:
Just to follow-up on that last question, and to confirm that probable $7-8 million of revenues on the Atlanta airport project for the fourth quarter would have been contained, at least partially or perhaps largely in the Asphalt Group, since that is the one that did the assembly?
DR. J. DON BROCK:
That is correct.
THE OPERATOR:
Jim Brilliant with Century Management.
THE CALLER:
My question has been answered.
THE OPERATOR:
Jack Kasprzak.
THE CALLER:
McKamy, can you tell us what you think the effective tax rate in 2003 will be?
MR. McKAMY HALL:
My right arm is saying 35-38. It all depends on the mix.
DR. J. DON BROCK:
Gentlemen, thank you. I would like to ask Steve to make a couple of other comments, and then we will close for the day.
STEPHEN C. ANDERSON:
We do appreciate your interest in Astec. As our press release indicates, today's conference call has been recorded.

Item 9. Regulation FD Disclosure (Information furnished under this Item 9 is furnished under Item 12)
In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 33-8126, the following information, which is intended to be furnished under Item 12, "Results of Operations and Financial Condition," is instead being furnished under Item 9, "Regulation FD Disclosure." This information (including shall not be deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that Section.
Exhibit 99.1)
On April 21, 2003, Astec Industries, Inc. issued a press release setting forth the Company's first quarter 2003 financial results. A copy of the Company's press release is attached as to this Form 8-K and is herein incorporated by reference.
Exhibit 99.1
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
ASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC.
Date: April 21, 2003 By:
/s/ J. Don Brock
J. Don Brock, Chairman of the Board
and President (Principal Executive Officer)
 
  

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (April 21, 2003) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2003 were $122.1 million compared with $122.4 million for the first quarter of 2002. Domestic sales accounted for 80.7% and international sales for 19.3% of revenues during the first quarter of 2003 compared to 84.7% for domestic sales and 15.3% for international sales during the first quarter of 2002. The Company reported a net loss of $1.8 million or $.09 per share for the first quarter of 2003 compared to net income of $4.6 million or $.23 per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2002. The Company's backlog at March 31, 2003 was $53.3 million compared with $74.7 million at March 31, 2002, restated to reflect the addition of the Case trencher line.
Consolidated financial statements for the first quarter ended March 31, 2003, and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "While revenues were essentially the same this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2002, the mix in revenues between our various products was considerably different. Shortfalls in the core business revenues were partially offset by the addition of the Case trencher line revenue at our new Loudon, Tennessee facility along with increased used equipment sales. However, the continued start-up costs and ramping up of production at the Loudon facility offset the income from Case trencher sales and contributed to the net loss of the Underground Group Segment."
"Compared to March 31, 2002, we reduced inventory by approximately $24 million, with approximately $4 million of this reduction in used equipment. While these reductions generated cash and added to our sales volume, they had only a small positive impact on the gross profit. We will continue to emphasize reductions in inventories and receivables to generate cash. During the first quarter, we also experienced approximately $2.2 million in real estate recording fees, amendment fees, legal and consulting fees and increased interest related to our current lending arrangement. Negotiations to refinance the current credit facility are progressing satisfactorily and we continue to pursue the sale of the remaining Astec Financial portfolio of loans and leases and the sale of the Grapevine, Texas property."

Comments Concerning the Second Quarter of 2003
The following discussion is a compilation of "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this press release.
On April 11, 2003, the House and Senate approved a non-binding budget resolution that assumes a minimum highway funding level of $218 billion for fiscal years 2004-2009. The resolution also contains authorizations that would allow highway and transit spending for up to $231 billion over the next six fiscal years if the new Highway Trust Fund revenues are available. If this resolution becomes part of the budget, federal highway funding will increase from its current level of $31.6 billion in 2003 to an average of $36.3 billion for years 2004 to 2009, and could increase to an average of $38.5 billion if new revenues are made available to the Highway Trust Fund. Astec believes that its customers' attitudes will be positively impacted by the increasing availability of funding under the new budget resolutions when and if such resolutions become part of the budget.
Dr. Brock added, "We continue to focus on cutting costs and are poised to take advantage of upturns in the market when they occur. We are managing the company for the long-term and we expect to emerge from this economic downturn a better company."
Investor Conference Call and Web Simulcast
Astec will conduct a conference call on April 21, 2003, at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time to review its first quarter results as well as current business conditions. The number to call for this interactive teleconference is (800) 404-1354. Please reference Astec Industries.

Item 5. Other Events
On May 14, 2003, Astec Industries, Inc. ("Astec") and its subsidiaries entered into credit agreements with each of General Electric Capital Corporation and General Electric Capital Canada Inc. The credit agreements established a senior credit facility comprised of a four-year $112.5 million senior secured asset-based revolving facility and a four-year $37.5 million senior secured term loan. Astec used the proceeds of the initial borrowings under the facility to repay the company's former credit facility and senior notes and to pay transaction costs. In connection with the prepayment of the former senior notes, Astec issued to the former senior note holders subordinated convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $10 million to satisfy "make-whole" obligations due under the senior notes by reason of the prepayment. Astec may prepay the subordinated notes at a discount from the principal amount pursuant to an agreed upon schedule as set forth in the form of the subordinated co nvertible notes attached as an exhibit to this Form 8-K. In addition, the subordinated convertible notes are, at the option of the holder, convertible into shares of Astec common stock at a fixed conversion price of $8.17 per share.

12.2
Waivers by Borrowers
. Each Borrower expressly waives all rights it may have now or in the future under any statute, or at common law, or at law or in equity, or otherwise, to compel Agent or Lenders to marshal assets or to proceed in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereunder against any other Credit Party, any other party or against any security for the payment and performance of the Obligations before proceeding against, or as a condition to proceeding against, such Borrower.

Waiver of Subrogation, Etc.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, and except as set forth in , each Borrower hereby expressly and irrevocably waives any and all rights at law or in equity to subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, indemnification or set off and any and all defenses available to a surety, guarantor or accommodation co-obligor. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that this waiver is intended to benefit Agent and Lenders and shall not limit or otherwise affect such Borrower's liability hereunder or the enforceability of this , and that Agent, Lenders and their respective successors and assigns are intended third party beneficiaries of the waivers and agreements set forth in this .

Section 12.4
Election of Remedies
. If Agent or any Lender may, under applicable law, proceed to realize its benefits under any of the Loan Documents giving Agent or such Lender a Lien upon any Collateral, whether owned by any Borrower or by any other Person, either by judicial foreclosure or by non-judicial sale or enforcement, Agent or any Lender may, at its sole option, determine which of its remedies or rights it may pursue without affecting any of its rights and remedies under this . If, in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Agent or any Lender shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its right to enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any applicable laws pertaining to "election of remedies" or the like, each Borrower hereby consents to such action by Agent or such Lender and waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by Agent or such Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of subroga tion that each Borrower might otherwise have had but for such action by Agent or such Lender.

In the event Agent or any Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee's sale or at any private sale permitted by law or the Loan Documents, Agent or such Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Obligations and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Agent or such Lender but shall be credited against the Obligations. The amount of the successful bid at any such sale, whether Agent, Lender or any other party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market value of the Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Obligations shall be conclusively deemed to be the amount of the Obligations guar anteed under this , notwithstanding that any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to which Agent or any Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale.

Conversion
Subject to the provisions of this Section, at the option of the Holder, at any time, the principal amount of this Note, plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, may be converted into shares of the Parent's common stock, $.20 par value per share (the "Common Stock") at the Conversion Price, determined as provided below.
The conversion of principal of this Note shall be based (i) if the conversion occurs on or prior to October 31, 2003, on the corresponding Redemption Amount with respect to the amount of such principal so to be converted that would otherwise be payable by the Obligors had such amount of principal been redeemed by the Obligors plus accrued interest to the date of conversion, all in accordance with the table set forth above and the period such conversion takes place and (ii) if the conversion occurs at any time after October 31, 2003, on the principal amount due upon maturity of this Note plus accrued interest to the date of such conversion. Accordingly, upon conversion of all or a portion of this Note, the Holder shall be entitled to receive one share of Common Stock for each Eight Dollars and Seventeen Cents ($8.17) ("Conversion Price") of (x) in the case of (i) above, the Redemption Amount that would otherwise be payable by the Obligors had the Obligors elected to redeem the Note at t he time of conversion plus accrued but unpaid interest through the Conversion Date and (y) in the case of (ii) above, the principal amount that will be due upon maturity of this Note plus accrued but unpaid interest through the Conversion Date. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of this Note. Instead of a fraction of a share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of this Note, the Parent shall pay a cash adjustment in respect of such fraction of a share of Common Stock in an amount equal to the same fractional interest of the Conversion Price. The Parent shall pay all taxes and other charges in respect of the issuance of shares of Common Stock to the Holder upon such conversion.
The Conversion Price shall be adjusted for any stock dividends, stock splits, subdivisions, reclassification, combinations or similar events by multiplying such Conversion price by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event and the denominator shall be the number of shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the date of such event. Promptly after any adjustment in the Conversion Price pursuant to this paragraph, the Parent shall give written notice to the Holder of the Conversion Price following such adjustment, together with a schedule of computations of such adjustment and confirmation from the Parent's auditors of such adjustment.
In the event of any capital reorganization of the Parent, any reclassification of the stock of the Parent (other than a change in par value or from par value to no par value or from no par value to par value), or any consolidation or merger of the Parent, this Note shall after such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, or merger be convertible into the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Parent or of the corporation resulting from such consolidation or surviving such merger to which the Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable (immediately prior to the time of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger) upon conversion of such Note would have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation or merger. The provisions of this clause shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications, consolidations or mergers.
If the Parent shall propose to take any action of the types described in the paragraph above, the Parent shall give notice to the Holder which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect to any such action and the date on which such action is to take place. Such notice shall also set forth such facts with respect thereto as shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect of such action (to the extent such effect may be known at the date of such notice) on the Conversion Price and the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which shall be deliverable or purchasable upon the occurrence of such action or deliverable upon conversion of the Notes. In the case of any action which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at least 20 days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other action, such notice shall be given at least 30 days prior to the taking of such proposed action. Failure to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.
In order to exercise the right of conversion pursuant to this Section, the Holder shall give five days written notice to the Parent that the Holder has elected to convert this Note. Following receipt of such conversion notice, the Holder shall surrender this Note to the Parent at its principal office. Upon receipt of the Note so surrendered by the Holder, the Parent shall issue and deliver to the Holder the certificate or certificates or other document evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion (and, in the event less than the entire principal amount of the Note is redeemed, a new Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion and containing the substantially identified terms to this Note). Such conversion shall be deemed to have been effected at the close of business on the date of surrender of the Note to the Parent (the "Conversion Date") and the Holder shall be deemed to have become a holder of record of the shares of Common Stock of the Parent in to which a principal amount of this Note was converted.
 
Accredited Investor Representation

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (July 17, 2003) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003.
 
Revenues for the second quarter of 2003 were $109.8 million compared with $126.7 million for the second quarter of 2002. International sales for the second quarter of 2003 were 20.2% of total revenues versus 18.6% for 2002. The net loss for the second quarter of 2003 was $2.2 million, or $.11 per fully diluted share, compared with net income of $2.4 million, or $0.12 per fully diluted share, for the second quarter of 2002. In the second quarter of 2003, $4.2 million of unusual charges were incurred that related to former lending arrangements, of which the largest component was a senior note termination expense of $3.8 million incurred in connection with the issuance of "make-whole" notes to former lenders. The note termination expense is shown on a separate line on the income statement below other income.

The net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2003, was $4.0 million, or $.21 per fully diluted share, compared with $7.0 million net income, or $.35 per fully diluted share for the same period in 2002.

Gross profit was substantially impacted by the reduction in volume, the underutilization of manufacturing capacity, negative margins on used equipment sales, first-time production of a new high capacity double barrel drum mixer and competitive price pressures."

Comments Concerning the Third Quarter of 2003
The following discussion is a compilation of "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this press release.
Dr. Brock added, "On May 14 the Company refinanced its credit facilities with G.E. Capital at a more favorable interest rate. The facility provides for up to $150,000,000 and is secured by the company's assets. The Company is continuing to pursue the sale of the Grapevine property. Most of the Astec Financial portfolio of loans and leases has been sold. The Company continues to reduce expenses in the manufacturing and sales, general & administration areas to be properly aligned with current sales volume levels. Astec believes that current funding levels being discussed in Congress will result in increased federal availability of highway funds and such funding should have a positive impact on customers' attitudes toward purchasing new equipment. The 50% depreciation allowed under the new tax provisions is attractive to purchasers, especially privately-owned companies."
Dr. J. Don Brock also stated, "As a result of Astec's response to the extended downturn in the economy, Astec will emerge as a leaner organization poised to take advantage of any upturn in the economy."

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (October 21, 2003) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2003 were $106.9 million compared with $126.1 million for the third quarter of 2002. Domestic sales accounted for 76.5% and international sales 23.5% of the third quarter revenues of 2003 compared to 85.9% for domestic sales and 14.1% for international sales of the third quarter revenues for 2002. The net loss for the third quarter of 2003 was $0.8 million, or $0.04 per share. The net loss for the third quarter of 2002 was $1.4 million or $0.07 per share.
Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, were $338.8 million compared with $375.2 million in the same period in 2002. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, was $4.8 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to net income of $5.6 million, or $0.28 per fully diluted share for the same period in 2002.
Consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2003 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached to this press release.
Astec's backlog at September 30, 2003, was $42.1 million compared with $63.4 million at September 30, 2002.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The lack of sales volume experienced in the third quarter, along with pricing pressure and underabsorbed overhead significantly impacted our gross margin. Compared to the third quarter of the prior year, we made progress in reducing our selling, general, administrative and engineering expenses by $3.2 million. Interest expense has been reduced $1.1 million for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of the prior year as a result of reducing our long-term debt. Of the year-to-date pre-tax loss of $7.8 million, $6.3 million is attributable to the refinancing of our debt. The $6.3 million of refinancing expense is composed of the senior note termination expense of $3.8 million (shown on a separate line in the income statement), $2.2 million included in S,G,A,&E expense, and $0.3 million included in the interest expense. We expect the challenging market conditions to persist for the res t of 2003 and into 2004. Based on our information, customers' operating results for the third quarter and the five-month continuation of the Federal Highway funding in addition to the 50% bonus depreciation are generating some positive indications in customers' capital expenditure plans.

ITEM 12. RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
 
On February 24, 2004, Astec Industries, Inc. (the "Company") issued a press release announcing its preliminary fourth quarter 2003 and fiscal year 2003 financial results.
A copy of the Company's press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.
 
 
Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
ASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC.
Date: February 27, 2004
 
 
 

 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (February 24, 2004) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today announced that, based upon a preliminary projection of its fourth quarter results, it will report a loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2003, that is expected to be in the range of $1.22 to $1.24 per diluted share (based on 19,623,990 shares) resulting in expected losses for the year of $1.46 to $1.48 per diluted share (based on 19,671,697 shares).
Commenting on the earnings pre-announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are disappointed in the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2003 and for the full year but are looking forward to 2004. The primary factors in the fourth quarter that negatively affected our earnings results were a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $16.3 million related to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142; underabsorbed overhead of approximately $2.9 million; a writedown of approximately $1.9 million on used and rental equipment to reflect the decreased market value due to poor economic conditions; and pre-tax losses from the Trencor and Astec Underground start-up operations at Loudon, Tennessee of approximately $3.6 million. The items account for a total of $24.7 million.
Dr. Brock added, "On the positive side, our underabsorbed overhead in the fourth quarter decreased from the prior year fourth quarter because of measures taken to reduce manufacturing expenses, and interest expense has declined $1.3 million for the fourth quarter. Our backlog at December 31, 2003 was $79.4 million compared to $60.7 million at December 31, 2002 for a 30.8% increase. Our backlog at January 31, 2004 was $90.7 million compared to $65.7 million at January 31, 2003 for a 38.1% increase. We believe we have hit the bottom of the economic cycle and have turned upward based on our backlog and customer activity. We anticipate that the six-year highway bill will be renewed, and we believe that an improving economy should increase state highway funding revenues and private commercial projects."
As of December 31, 2003, Astec was not in compliance with a financial covenant under its credit facility. Astec will release its fourth quarter and year-end fiscal 2003 financial results and reschedule a conference call upon completion of its negotiations with its lenders rather than on February 26, 2004 as previously announced. The Company has met with its lenders and expects to receive the waiver and amendment that will allow it to continue to classify the debt related to its credit facility as long-term.
Astec Industries, Inc. is a manufacturer of specialized equipment for building and restoring the world's infrastructure. Astec's manufacturing operations are divided into four business segments: aggregate processing and mining equipment; asphalt production equipment; mobile asphalt paving equipment; and underground boring, directional drilling and trenching equipment.

J. Don Brock, Chairman of the Board
and President (Principal Executive Officer)
 
  

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (March 4, 2004) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 in line with its preliminary projection issued on February 24, 2004.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2003 were $87.8 million compared with $105.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. Domestic sales were $63.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, or 71.9% of 2003 fourth quarter revenues, compared to domestic sales of $87.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, or 82.7% of 2002 fourth quarter revenues. International sales were $24.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, or 28.1% of 2003 fourth quarter revenues, compared to international sales of $18.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, or 17.3% of 2002 fourth quarter revenues. The Company reported a net loss of $24.1 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003 compared with a net loss of $10.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2002. The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2003 was within the range of expectations given by the Company in its February 24, 2004 press release.
Revenues for 2003 were $426.6 million compared with $480.6 million for 2002. Domestic sales were $331.0 million for 2003, or 77.6% of 2003 revenues, compared to domestic sales of $401.3 million for 2002, or 83.5% of 2002 revenues. International sales were $95.6 million for 2003, 22.4% of 2003 revenues, compared to international sales of $79.3 million for 2002, or 16.5% of 2002 revenues. The Company reported a net loss of $29.0 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, for 2003 compared with a net loss of $4.7 million, or $.24 per diluted share, for the prior year.
Consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2003 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Astec's backlog at December 31, 2003 as previously released was $79.4 million compared to $60.7 million for 2002. Astec's backlog at January 31, 2004, was $90.7 million compared with $65.7 million at January 31, 2003.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "As I mentioned in our February 24, 2004 press release, we are disappointed in the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2003 and for the full year but are looking forward to 2004. The primary factors in the fourth quarter that negatively affected our earnings results were a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $16.3 million related to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142; underabsorbed overhead of approximately $2.9 million; a writedown of approximately $1.9 million on used and rental equipment to reflect the decreased market value due to poor economic conditions; and pre-tax losses from the Trencor and Astec Underground start-up operations at Loudon, Tennessee of approximately $3.6 million." Dr. Brock added, "On the positive side, our underabsorbed overhead in the fourth quarter decreased from the prior year fourth quarter because of measures taken to reduce man ufacturing expenses, and interest expense has declined $1.3 million for the fourth quarter which reflects the debt reduction of $58.5 million in 2003. Our backlog at December 31, 2003 was $79.4 million compared to $60.7 million at December 31, 2002 for a 30.8% increase. Our backlog at January 31, 2004 was $90.7 million compared to $65.7 million at January 31, 2003 for a 38.1% increase. We believe we have hit the bottom of the economic cycle and have turned upward based on our backlog and customer activity. We anticipate that the six-year highway bill will be renewed, and we believe that an improving economy should increase state highway funding revenues and private commercial projects."
At December 31, 2003, Astec was not in compliance with a financial covenant under its credit facilities. The Company received a waiver for non-compliance for the fourth quarter of 2003 and has entered into amendments with its lenders effective as of December 31, 2003 which revise the financial covenant for the next three quarters.
Astec will reclassify the revolving portion of its credit facility for the second quarter ended June 30, 2003 and for the third quarter ended September 30, 2003 in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 95-22 "Balance Sheet Classification of Borrowings Outstanding under Revolving Credit Agreements That Include both a Subjective Acceleration Clause and a Lock-Box Arrangement."  The effect will be to reclassify debt previously reported as long-term debt amounting to $27.8 million and $39.6 million in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2003, respectively, to current liabilities.  In accordance with EITF 95-22, Astec will also be classifying the revolving portion of its credit facility as current liabilities in its financial statements as of December 31, 2003. The reclassifications will not have an impact on the Company's total assets, shareholder's equity, liquidity or the results of operations for the impacted quarters or for the year ended December 3 1, 2003 and will not affect the financial covenants in the Company's credit facilities. The reclassifications will be reflected in the Company's filings.
 
Investor Conference Call and Web Simulcast
Astec will conduct a conference call on March 5, 2004, at 9:00 a.m. EST to review its fourth quarter and fiscal 2003 financial results as well as its near term general outlook for 2004. The number to call for this interactive teleconference is (800) 404-1354. Please reference Astec Industries.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
 
ASTEC INDUSTRIES, INC.
 
 
 

 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (April 21, 2004) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today reported results for their first quarter ended March 31, 2004.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2004 were $143.1 million compared with $122.1 million for the first quarter of 2003. Domestic sales accounted for 79.5% and international sales for 20.5% of revenues during the first quarter of 2004 compared to 80.7% for domestic sales and 19.3% for international sales during the first quarter of 2003. The Company reported a net income of $5.5 million or $.27 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2004 compared to a net loss of $1.8 million or a loss of $.09 per share for the first quarter of 2003. The Company's backlog at March 31, 2004 was $108.8 million compared to $53.3 million at March 31, 2003.
Consolidated financial statements for the first quarter ended March 31, 2004, and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with the improved results for the first quarter of 2004. In 2003 we resized the Company's operations and are now benefiting from increased volumes in an improving market. We are emerging as a stronger company from the worst economic downturn Astec has experienced."
"We believe we are benefiting from pent-up demand and better products although a replacement six-year federal highway bill has yet to be enacted. Many state governments are continuing to experience financing concerns. Our efforts to operate more efficiently and manage our assets are generating benefits. Our debt has decreased $60.2 million from March 31, 2003 to March 31, 2004."
:
Outlook for Second Quarter of 2004
The following forecast is a compilation of "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this press release.
Congress reconvened this week with less than two weeks before the current federal highway/transit program extension is set to expire on April 30, 2004. Conferees need to be appointed to work out the differences between , the six-year $318 billion reauthorization measure, and S. 1072, the $275 billion Senate version of the bill. President Bush has requested a bill that does not exceed $256 billion.
H.R. 3550
Dr. Brock added, "We are cautiously optimistic about 2004 based in part on a significantly improved backlog. This is the first time since March 2000 the Company has reported a backlog exceeding $100 million. Although we are continuing to benefit from a weak dollar in the international market, we are concerned about rising raw steel prices impacting our product costs directly, as well as the costs of purchased parts and components primarily comprised of steel. Also, the increasing price of oil negatively impacts our customers' profitability and increases in interest rates could possibly negatively impact buyers' attitudes. We will continue to focus on asset management with further debt reduction and improved utilization of available capacity."

Exhibit 99.1
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (June 1, 2004) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) has entered into a definitive agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and transfer substantially all of the liabilities of Superior Industries of Morris, Inc. Superior, a wholly owned subsidiary of Astec Industries, Inc., manufactures stationary and portable conveyor systems and components. The planned sale is a result of an unsolicited proposal presented to Astec by the management and employees of Superior, along with a group of local investors in Minnesota. Prior to being acquired by Astec on November 1, 1999, Superior was owned by an Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
The purchase price for the assets and liabilities of Superior is approximately $24.3 million, which amount is subject to adjustment based on the performance of Superior in the second quarter. Proceeds will be used for additional working capital to support anticipated growth or to reduce debt levels and interest expense, both of which are in line with previously stated corporate objectives.
Astec Industries, Inc. will license from the purchaser certain intellectual property relating to conveyer components. The purchaser has agreed to be a supplier of certain components to Astec Industries, Inc. for a period of one year.
Closing, which is expected to occur on June 30, 2004, is contingent upon customary conditions, including that the purchaser will receive financing to complete the acquisition. Assuming the transaction is completed during the second quarter, the transaction will be discussed in the second quarter earnings conference call tentatively scheduled for July 21, 2004.
Astec Industries, Inc. is a manufacturer of specialized equipment for building and restoring the world's infrastructure.

Closing, which is expected to occur on June 30, 2004, is contingent upon customary conditions, including that the purchaser will receive financing to complete the acquisition. Assuming the transaction is completed during the second quarter, the transaction will be discussed in the second quarter earnings conference call tentatively scheduled for July 21, 2004.
Astec Industries, Inc. is a manufacturer of specialized equipment for building and restoring the world's infrastructure. Astec's manufacturing operations are divided into four business segments: aggregate processing and mining equipment; asphalt production equipment; mobile asphalt paving equipment; and underground boring, directional drilling and trenching equipment. Superior was part of the aggregate processing and mining equipment segment.
Certain statements in the press release, including statements regarding the sale of assets and liabilities of Superior, are "forward-looking statements" (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995). These forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are based upon currently available information, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise such statements. These statements are not guarantees of performance and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted or anticipated. Future events and actual results, financial or otherwise, could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause future events or actual results to differ materially include: the inability of the purchaser to receive financing for the transaction, the inability of the parties to secure any required approvals or consents or otherwise to complete the transaction in a timely manner, and other factors listed from time to time in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 and the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2004.

Comments Concerning The Third Quarter of 2004
The following discussion is a compilation of "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this Press Release.
Dr. J. Don Brock also stated, "We are concerned about the possible delay or reluctance in buyer's decisions on larger equipment because the reauthorization of TEA- 21 has not been resolved by Congress. Fluctuating oil prices continue to impact the cost of asphalt for our customers. Continued steel price increases and the resulting cost increases in purchased components threaten gross margins if sale prices can't be achieved to overcome the cost increases. An improving economy should lead to more fuel tax collections and a healthier status of state government funding. The reauthorization of TEA-21 could provide a very positive impact to our customer's current attitude toward spending. Customers have profited from the smaller contracts awarded to utilize piecemeal federal awards and some are now considering the need for capital expenditures to take advantage of the current opportunity to generate accelerated depreciation to reduce income taxes. This tax-break will expire December 31, 2004 and could lead to orders in the third and fourth quarters."

ITEM 4.01. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT
On September 10, 2004, Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm for Astec Industries, Inc. ("Astec") effective as of such date. The resignation was the sole decision of E&Y and was not sought, recommended or approved by Astec's audit committee, but the resignation was accepted by Astec's audit committee.
The reports of E&Y on Astec's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2004 through September 10, 2004, Astec had no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report on the consolidated financial statements for such periods.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and from January 1, 2004 through September 10, 2004, there were no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(v)).
On September 10, 2004, Astec's audit committee engaged Grant Thornton LLP ("Grant Thornton") as the new independent registered public accounting firm for Astec. During Astec's fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2004 through September 10, 2004, Astec did not consult Grant Thornton regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or contemplated transaction, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Astec's financial statements nor did Astec consult Grant Thornton regarding any matter that was the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(iv)) or a reportable event.
Astec provided E&Y with a copy of this Form 8-K prior to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and requested that E&Y furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of E&Y's letter dated September 10, 2004, is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.

Comments Concerning the Fourth Quarter of 2004
The following discussion is a compilation of "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "The sales increase of 10.5% in the third quarter over the prior year was less favorable than the first and second quarterly improvements as we continue to operate in an industry which prefers to make large capital expenditure commitments with the positive visibility that a six-year highway bill provides. The sales volume in the third quarter compared to the prior year generated increased manufacturing overhead absorption which positively impacted our gross margin while increased steel costs had an estimated negative impact of 3%-4%. Compared to the third quarter of the prior year, our selling, general, administrative and engineering expenses increased in the areas of health insurance, research and development, recruitment and relocation, and costs associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. The fourth quarter market conditions should benefit from the current opportunity to accelerate depreciatio n which will expire on December 31, 2004 and we expect improved market conditions in 2005. Since the federal highway funding extension thru May 31, 2005 has now been passed, we expect that long-term legislation will be passed next spring which will provide a more positive environment for larger capital expenditures by our customer base. Another positive factor is our open order backlog, which is 64% ahead of last year at this time."

Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with our revenues and profits for 2004. We exceeded our internal forecast and believe that we could have performed much better had it not been for the rapid escalation of steel prices. The fourth quarter was seasonably weak as we expected but remained profitable."
"As we look forward in 2005, we are starting with strong backlogs in each company. We are diligently watching our margins in the face of continued component pricing increases. Steel pricing seems to be stabilizing. The Senate, House and Administration are all finally in agreement on a new $284 billion dollar highway bill. This will increase funding for the next five years, especially in 2005 and 2009."
Dr. Brock added, "With our backlog up 31% at January 31 versus the prior year plus more volume for our customers from an improving economy and increased highway funding, we are optimistic about continued improvement in our operations throughout 2005."

Exhibit 10.1
Pursuant to a resolution of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company, in accordance with Article 11 of the Plan, the Plan is hereby amended as follows:
1. By adding the following sentence to the definition of "Annual Retainer":
"Annual Retainers shall be paid in cash unless a Participant elects instead to receive shares of Common Stock (pursuant to Article 6 hereof) or Options (pursuant to Article 7 hereof) in payment of his or her Annual Retainer."
2. By deleting Article 4 in its entirety and replacing it with the following:
"4. Shares Subject to Plan. The Shares issued under the Plan shall not exceed in the aggregate 200,000 Shares of Common Stock. Such Shares may be authorized and unissued Shares or treasury Shares."
3. By deleting the first sentence of Section 6(a) in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

EXHIBIT 99.1
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (April 20, 2005) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today reported results for their first quarter ended March 31, 2005.
The income from continuing operations for 2005 was $0.33 per diluted share compared to $0.24 per diluted share in 2004 for a 37.5% increase. Income from continuing operations does not include results from Superior Industries of Morris, Inc., which was sold on June 30, 2004.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2005 were $161.6 million compared with $135.7million for the first quarter of 2004. Domestic sales accounted for 82.4% and international sales for 17.6% of revenues during the first quarter of 2005 compared to 78.8% for domestic sales and 21.2% for international sales during the first quarter of 2004, respectively. The Company reported net income of $6.8 million or $0.33 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2005 compared to net income of $5.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2004. The Company's backlog at March 31, 2005 was $111.2 million compared to $103.5 million at March 31, 2004.
Consolidated financial statements for the first quarter ended March 31, 2005, and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased, but not satisfied, with the results for the first quarter of 2005. The sales volume increased 19.1% for continuing operations compared to the first quarter of 2004. The gross margin percentage improvement did not meet our expectations as a result of price increases not being initiated as quickly as the costs increased as well as unanticipated cost increases of certain raw materials and certain purchased parts."
"Selling, general, administrative and engineering expenses were 14.4% of sales in the first quarter of 2005 compared to 14.6% of sales for the same period in 2004. We strive to hold S,G,A&E in line with the company's goal of 14% of sales or less. The Company believes that its increase in volume is reflective of an improving economy, positive customer attitudes, and the expectation that final highway/transit funding legislation will be enacted. The Company expects that fiscal year federal highway spending will increase from $31.9 billion to $38.1 billion for 2005 for a 19.4% increase."
:
Outlook for Second Quarter of 2005
The following forecast is a compilation of "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this press release.
Congress reconvened this week with less than six weeks remaining before the sixth extension of the federal highway/transit program is set to expire on May 31, 2005. The Bush Administration has stated a willingness to support a six-year bill in the amount of $284 billion versus their pre-election maximum of $256 billion. On March 10, 2005, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a $284 billion bill by a vote of 417 to 9. The four Senate sub-committees required to approve the pending highway legislation have done so as of April 19, 2005. Remaining steps to finalize the bill include a positive final vote by the full Senate, approval by the Senate/House Conference Committee and the signing of the bill into law by the Bush Administration.
Dr. Brock added, "We believe we have a healthy backlog as of the start of our second quarter. We will continue to monitor costs closely and will focus on asset management and debt reduction."
"ConExpo, which is the largest construction show held in the United States, was held in March. In my opinion, this is the best ConExpo we've had in the last 24 years. We made more sales at ConExpo and picked up more prospects than we did at any prior show."

Comments Concerning the Fourth Quarter of 2005
The following discussion is a compilation of "forward-looking statements" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with the third quarter 2005 net sales increase of 33.5% compared to the third quarter 2004 net sales even though we were unable to recognize the revenue related to the sale and shipment of two completed asphalt plants because the customers experienced last-minute permitting delays. Sales of utility trenchers continued in the third quarter to be negatively impacted by the high dealer inventory levels that existed when we transitioned from Case distribution of small trenchers to Astec distribution of small trenchers on September 30, 2004. We are pleased that the sale of the Grapevine, Texas property was completed in the third quarter.
The term debt was paid in full and the only remaining debt is in the form of Industrial Revenue Bonds which will be paid in full in the fourth quarter.
Although the fourth quarter is normally our seasonally slowest quarter, we are pleased with the current condition of our balance sheet and we believe the full effects of the new highway bill ("SAFETEALU") will be felt in 2006. With the industrial bonds being paid in full in the fourth quarter, we should be poised to take advantage of available opportunities."

The Company will mail or arrange for the mailing of a copy of the Rights Agreement to the holder of this certificate without charge promptly after the receipt of a written request therefor."
Certificates representing shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding at the Record Time shall evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock evidenced thereby notwithstanding the absence of the foregoing legend.
2.3 . (a) Subject to Sections 3.1, 5.1 and 5.10 and subject to adjustment as herein set forth, each Right will entitle the holder thereof, after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time, to purchase, for the Exercise Price, one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock.
Exercise of Rights; Separation of Rights
(b) Until the Separation Time, (i) no Right may be exercised and (ii) each Right will be evidenced by the certificate for the associated share of Common Stock (together, in the case of certificates issued prior to the Record Time, with the letter or notice mailed to the record holder thereof pursuant to Section 2.1) and will be transferable only together with, and will be transferred by a transfer (whether with or without such letter or notice) of, such associated share.
(c) Subject to this Section 2.3 and to Sections 3.1, 5.1 and 5.10, after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time, the Rights (i) may be exercised and (ii) may be transferred independent of shares of Common Stock. Promptly following the Separation Time, the Company will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign, and the Rights Agent will (if provided with all necessary information) mail to each holder of record of Common Stock as of the Separation Time (other than any Person whose Rights have become void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), at such holder's address as shown by the records of the Company (the Company hereby agreeing to furnish copies of such records to the Rights Agent for this purpose), (x) a certificate (a "Rights Certificate") in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto appropriately completed, representing the number of Rights held by such holder at the Separation Time and having such marks of identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate (but which do not affect the rights, duties or responsibilities of the Rights Agent) and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any national securities exchange or quotation system on which the Rights may from time to time be listed or traded, or to conform to usage, and (y) a disclosure statement describing the Rights. The Company shall promptly notify the Rights Agent in writing upon the occurrence of the Separation Time and, if such notification is given orally, the Company shall confirm the same in writing on or prior to the Business Day next following. Until such notice is received the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent may presume conclusively for all purposes that the Separation Time has not occurred.
(d) Subject to Sections 3.1, 5.1 and 5.10, Rights may be exercised on any Business Day after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time by submitting to the Rights Agent the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights with an Election to Exercise (an "Election to Exercise") substantially in the form attached to the Rights Certificate duly and properly completed, accompanied by payment in cash, or by certified or official bank check or money order payable to the order of the Company, of a sum equal to the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Rights being exercised and a sum sufficient to cover any tax or charge which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates for shares or depository receipts (or both) in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being exercised.
(e) Upon receipt of a Rights Certificate, with an Election to Exercise duly and properly completed and accompanied by payment as set forth in Section 2.3(d), and subject to Sections 3.1, 5.1 and 5.10, The Rights Agent will thereupon promptly (i)(A) requisition from a transfer agent stock certificates evidencing such number of shares or other securities to be purchased (the Company hereby irrevocably authorizing its transfer agents to comply with all such requisitions) and (B) if the Company elects pursuant to Section 5.5 not to issue certificates representing fractional shares, requisition from the depositary selected by the Company depositary receipts representing the fractional shares to be purchased or requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 5.5 and (ii) after receipt of such certificates, depositary receipts and/or cash, deliver the same to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Rights Certificate, registered (in t he case of certificates or depository receipts) in such name or names as may be designated by such holder.
(f) In case the holder of any Rights shall exercise less than all the Rights evidenced by such holder's Rights Certificate, a new Rights Certificate evidencing the Rights remaining unexercised will be issued by the Rights Agent to such holder or to such holder's duly authorized assigns.
(g) The Company covenants and agrees that it will (i) take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates for such shares (subject to payment of the Exercise Price), be duly and validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered and fully paid and nonassessable; (ii) take all such action as may be necessary to comply with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any other applicable law, rule or regulation, in connection with the issuance of any shares upon exercise of Rights; and (iii) pay when due and payable any and all taxes and charges which may be payable in respect of the original issuance or delivery of the Rights Certificates or of any shares issued upon the exercise of Rights, provided that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax or charge which may be payable i n respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates for shares in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being transferred or exercised.
2.4 .
Adjustments to Exercise Price; Number of Rights
(a) In the event the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time (i) declare or pay a dividend on Common Stock payable in Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common Stock, (x) the Exercise Price in effect after such adjustment will be equal to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment divided by the number of shares of Common Stock (the "Expansion Factor") that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such dividend, subdivision or combination would hold thereafter as a result thereof and (y) each Right held prior to such adjustment will become that number of Rights equal to the Expansion Factor, and the adjusted number of Rights will be deemed to be distributed among the shares of Common Stock with respect to which the original Rights were associated (if they remain outstanding) and the shares issued in respect of such divide nd, subdivision or combination, so that each such share of Common Stock will have exactly one Right associated with it. Each adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall be made as of the payment or effective date for the applicable dividend, subdivision or combination.
In the event the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time issue any shares of Common Stock otherwise than in a transaction referred to in the preceding paragraph, each such share of Common Stock so issued shall automatically have one new Right associated with it, which Right shall be evidenced by the certificate representing such share. To the extent provided in Section 5.3, Rights shall be issued by the Company in respect of shares of Common Stock that are issued or sold by the Company after the Separation Time.
(b) In the event the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time issue or distribute any securities or assets in respect of, in lieu of or in exchange for Common Stock (other than pursuant to a regular periodic cash dividend or a dividend paid solely in Common Stock) whether by dividend, in a reclassification or recapitalization (including any such transaction involving a merger, consolidation or share exchange), or otherwise, the Company shall make such adjustments, if any, in the Exercise Price, number of Rights and/or securities or other property purchasable upon exercise of Rights as the Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole discretion, may deem to be appropriate under the circumstances in order to adequately protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally, and the Company and the Rights Agent shall amend this Agreement as necessary to provide for such adjustments.
(c) Each adjustment to the Exercise Price made pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be calculated to the nearest cent. Whenever an adjustment to the Exercise Price is made pursuant to this Section 2.4, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the facts and computations accounting for such adjustment and (ii) promptly file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Stock a copy of such certificate. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate and on any adjustment or statement therein contained and shall have no duty or liability with respect to, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any adjustment or any such event unless and until it shall have received such certificate.
Rights certificates shall represent the securities purchasable under the terms of this Agreement, including any adjustment or change in the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, even though such certificates may continue to express the securities purchasable at the time of issuance of the initial Rights Certificates.
2.5 . Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price for such Rights (and any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the exercising holder hereunder) was made; provided, however, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.
Date on Which Exercise is Effective
2.6 . (a) The Rights Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries.

No Rights Certificate shall be valid for any purpose unless manually countersigned by the Rights Agent.
(b) Each Rights Certificate shall be dated the date of countersignature thereof.
2.7 . (a) After the Separation Time, the Company will cause to be kept a register (the "Rights Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company will provide for the registration and transfer of Rights. Following receipt by the Rights Agent of notice of the Separation Time, the Rights Agent is hereby appointed "Rights Registrar" for the purpose of maintaining the Rights Register for the Company and registering Rights and transfers of Rights after the Separation Time as herein provided.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.1(b), all Rights issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Rights Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company, and such Rights shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as the Rights surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
(c) Every Rights Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Rights Agent, as the case may be, duly executed by the holder thereof or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.

The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation under this provision of the Agreement unless and until it is satisfied that all such taxes and/or governmental charges have been paid.
(d) The Company shall not be required to register the transfer or exchange of any Rights after such Rights have become void under Section 3.1(b), been exchanged under Section 3.1(c) or been terminated under Section 5.1.
2.8 . (a) If any mutilated Rights Certificate is surrendered to the Rights Agent prior to the Expiration Time, then, subject to Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c) and 5.1, the Company shall execute and the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver in exchange therefor a new Rights Certificate evidencing the same number of Rights as did the Rights Certificate so surrendered.
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Rights Certificates
(b) If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Rights Agent prior to the Expiration Time (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Rights Certificate and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any of their agents harmless, then, subject to Sections 3.1(b), 3.1(c) and 5.1 and in the absence of notice to the Company or the Rights Agent that such Rights Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its request the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate, a new Rights Certificate evidencing the same number of Rights as did the Rights Certificate so destroyed, lost or stolen.

(d) Every new Rights Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 2.8 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate shall evidence an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and, subject to Section 3.1(b), shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately with any and all other Rights duly issued hereunder.
2.9 . Prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name such Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, such Common Stock certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Agreement of Rights Holders
(a) prior to the Separation Time, each Right will be transferable only together with, and will be transferred by a transfer of, the associated share of Common Stock;
(b) after the Separation Time, the Rights Certificates will be transferable only on the Rights Register as provided herein;
(c) prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary;
(d) Rights beneficially owned by certain Persons will, under the circumstances set forth in Section 3.1(b), become void; and
(e) this Agreement may be supplemented or amended from time to time pursuant to Section 2.4(b) or 5.4 hereof.
3.1 . (a) In the event that prior to the Expiration Time a Flip-In Date shall occur, except as provided in this Section 3.1, each Right shall constitute the right to purchase from the Company, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof (but subject to Section 5.10), that number of shares of Common Stock having an aggregate Market Price on the Stock Acquisition Date equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that on or after such Stock Acquisition Date an event of a type analogous to any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b) shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock).
Flip-In
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Rights that are or were Beneficially Owned on or after the Stock Acquisition Date by an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof or by any transferee, direct or indirect, of any of the foregoing shall become void and any holder of such Rights (including transferees) shall thereafter have no right to exercise or transfer such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. If any Rights Certificate is presented for assignment or exercise and the Person presenting the same will not complete the certification set forth at the end of the form of assignment or notice of election to exercise and provide such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner and its Affiliates and Associates (or former Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates and Associates) as the Company shall reasonably request, then the Company shall be entitled conclusively to deem the Beneficial Owner thereof to be an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof or a trans feree of any of the foregoing and accordingly will deem the Rights evidenced thereby to be void and not transferable or exercisable.
(c) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after a Flip-In Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, elect to exchange all (but not less than all) the then outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(b)) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of holders of Rights generally in the event that after the Separation Time an event of a type analogous to any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b) shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock (such exchange ratio, as adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Ratio").
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company electing to exchange the Rights, without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right (other than Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) will thereafter represent only the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. Promptly after the action of the Board of Directors electing to exchange the Rights, the Company shall give written notice thereof (specifying the steps to be taken to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange for Rights) to the Rights Agent and the holders of the Rights (other than Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) outstanding immediately prior thereto by mailing such notice in accordance with Section 5.9.
Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued upon the exchange of Rights pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) or Section 3.1(d) shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the holder was made; provided, however, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such shares on, and such Certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open.
(d) Whenever the Company shall become obligated under Section 3.1(a) or (c) to issue shares of Common Stock upon exercise of or in exchange for Rights, the Company, at its option, may substitute therefor shares of Preferred Stock, at a ratio of one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock for each share of Common Stock so issuable.
(e) In the event that there shall not be sufficient treasury shares or authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock of the Company to permit the exercise or exchange in full of the Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(a) or (c), the Company shall either (i) call a meeting of shareholders seeking approval to cause sufficient additional shares to be authorized (provided that if such approval is not obtained the Company will take the action specified in clause (ii) of this sentence) or (ii) take such action as shall be necessary to ensure and provide, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any agreements or instruments in effect on the Stock Acquisition Date to which it is a party, that each Right shall thereafter constitute the right to receive, (x) at the Company's option, either (A) in return for the Exercise Price, debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to twice the Exercise Price, or (B) without payment of consideratio n (except as otherwise required by applicable law), debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to the Exercise Price, or (y) if the Board of Directors of the Company elects to exchange the Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(c), debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair value equal to the product of the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the Flip-In Date times the Exchange Ratio in effect on the Flip-In Date, where in any case set forth in (x) or (y) above the fair value of such debt or equity securities or other assets shall be as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with a nationally recognized investment banking firm.
3.2 . (a) Prior to the Expiration Time, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to, consummate or permit to occur any Flip-Over Transaction or Event unless and until it shall have entered into a supplemental agreement with the Flip-Over Entity, for the benefit of the holders of the Rights, providing that, upon consummation or occurrence of the Flip-Over Transaction or Event (i) each Right shall thereafter constitute the right to purchase from the Flip-Over Entity, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof, that number of shares of Flip-Over Stock of the Flip-Over Entity having an aggregate Market Price on the date of consummation or occurrence of such Flip-Over Transaction or Event equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that after such date of consummation or occurrence an event of a type analogous to any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b) shall have occurred with respect to the Flip-Over Stock) and (ii) the Flip-Over Entity shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such Flip-Over Transaction or Event and such supplemental agreement, all the obligations and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 3.2 shall apply to successive Flip-Over Transactions or Events.
Flip-Over
(b) Prior to the Expiration Time, unless the Rights will be terminated pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof in connection therewith, the Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to, consummate or permit to occur any Flip-Over Transaction or Event if at the time thereof there are any rights, warrants or securities outstanding or any other arrangements, agreements or instruments that would eliminate or otherwise diminish in any material respect the benefits intended to be afforded by this Rights Agreement to the holders of Rights upon consummation of such transaction.
4.1 . (a) The Company hereby appoints the Rights Agent to act as agent for the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the preparation, delivery, amendment, administration and execution of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability, damage, judgment, fine, penalty, claim, demand, settlement, cost or expense (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel), incurred without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misc onduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction) for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be done by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance, administration, exercise and performance of its duties under this Agreement. The costs and expenses incurred in enforcing this right of indemnification shall be paid by the Company. The provisions of this Section 4.1 and Section 4.3 below shall survive the termination of this Agreement, the exercise or expiration of the Rights and the resignation, replacement or removal of the Rights Agent.
General
(b) The Rights Agent shall be authorized and protected and shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection with its acceptance and administration of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder, in reliance upon any certificate for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights, Rights Certificate, certificate for other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper person or persons.
4.2 . (a) Any Person into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent is a party, or any Person succeeding to business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, will be the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto; provided, however, that such Person would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof. In case at the time such successor Rights Agent succeeds to the agency created by this Agreement any of the Rights Certificates have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent and deliver such Rights Certi ficates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates have not been countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates will have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.
Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights Agent
(b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent is changed and at such time any of the Rights Certificates shall have been countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such Rights Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in all such cases such Rights Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.
4.3 . The Rights Agent undertakes to perform only the duties and obligations expressly imposed by this Agreement (and no implied duties) upon the following terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Rights Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
Rights and Duties of Rights Agent
(a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company or an employee of the Rights Agent), and the advice or opinion of such counsel will be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered, or omitted by it and in accordance with such advice or opinion.
(b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking, suffering or omitting to take any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by a person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate will be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and the Rights Agent will incur no liability for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.
(c) The Rights Agent will be liable hereunder only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct (which gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction). Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the Rights Agent be liable for special, punitive, indirect, consequential or incidental loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Rights Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage. Any liability of the Rights Agent under this Agreement will be limited to the amount of annual fees paid by the Company to the Rights Agent.
(d) The Rights Agent will not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or in the certificates for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or the Rights Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals are and will be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(e) The Rights Agent will not have any liability for or be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any certificate for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or Rights Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor will it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor will it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to Section 3.1(b) hereof) or any change or adjustment in the terms of the Rights including adjustment required under the provisions of Section 2.4, 3.1 or 3.2 hereof or responsible for the manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with respect to the exercise of Rights after receipt of the certificate contemplated by Section 2.4 describing any such adjustment); nor will it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or any Rights or as to whether any securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights will, when issued, be duly and validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered and fully paid and nonassessable.
(f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
(g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from any person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company, and to apply to such persons for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and such instructions shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights Agent and it shall not be liable for or in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions. In the event the Rights Agent believes any ambiguity or uncertainty exists hereunder or in any notice, instruction, direction, request, or other communication, paper, or document received by the Rights Agent hereunder, the Rights Agent, may, in its sole discretion, refrain from taking any action, and shall be fully protected and shall not be liable in any way to the Company or the holders of the Rights or any other Person for refraining from taking such action, unless the Rights Agent receives written instructions signed by the Company that eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of the Rights Agent.
(h) The Rights Agent and any shareholder, affiliate, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in Common Stock, Rights or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though the Rights Agent were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent or any such shareholder, affiliate, director, officer or employee from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other Person.
(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself (through its directors, officers and employees) or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent will not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company or any other Person resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, absent gross negligence or bad faith in the selection and continued employment thereof (which gross negligence or bad faith must be determined by a final, non-appealable order, judgment, decree or ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction).
(j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expand or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its rights if it believes that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not assured to it.
(k) If, with respect to any Rights Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate attached to the form of assignment or form of election to purchase, as the case may be, has not been completed, the Company and the Rights Agent will deem the Beneficial Owner of the rights evidenced by such Rights Certificate to be an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof and such assignment or election to purchase will not be honored.
4.4 . The Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 days notice (or such lesser notice as is acceptable to the Company) in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of Common Stock, and Preferred Stock known to the Rights Agent by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with Section 5.9. The Company may remove the Rights Agent upon 30 days notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with Section 5.9. If the Rights Agent should resign or be removed or otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company will appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company fails to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of any Rights (which holder shall, with such notice, submit such holder's Rights Certificate for inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Rights or the Rights Agent may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be (a) a Person organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of the State of Georgia or any other State of the United States, in good standing, which is authorized under such laws to exercise the powers of the Rights Agent contemplated by this Agreement and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (b) an affiliate of a Person described in the immediately preceding clause (a). After appointment, the successor Rights Agent will be vested with the same powers, rights, duti es and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company will file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the holders of the Rights. Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 4.4, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Change of Rights Agent
5.1 . (a) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time prior to the close of business on the Flip-In Date, elect to terminate the Rights without any payment to any holder thereof.
Termination
(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company electing to terminate the Rights (or, if the resolution of the Board of Directors electing to terminate the Rights states that the termination will not be effective until the occurrence of a specified future time or event, upon the occurrence of such future time or event), without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right will thereafter be null and void. The Company shall provide the Rights Agent with prompt written notice of the Termination.
5.2 . The Rights and this Agreement shall expire at the Expiration Time and no Person shall have any rights pursuant to this Agreement or any Right after the Expiration Time, except, if the Rights are exchanged, as provided in Section 3.1 hereof.
Expiration
5.3 .
Issuance of New Rights Certificate
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or change in the number or kind or class of shares of stock purchasable upon exercise of Rights made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock by the Company following the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time pursuant to the terms of securities convertible or redeemable into shares of Common Stock or to options, in each case issued or granted prior to, and outstanding at, the Separation Time, the Company shall issue to the holders of such shares of Common Stock, Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with the issuance or sale of such shares of Common Stock; provided, however, in each case, (i) no such Rights Certifi cate shall be issued, if, and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Company or to the Person to whom such Rights Certificates would be issued, (ii) no such Rights Certificates shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall have otherwise been made in lieu of the issuance thereof, and (iii) the Company shall have no obligation to distribute Rights Certificates to any Acquiring Person or Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or any transferee of any of the foregoing.
5.4 . The Company and the Rights Agent may from time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any holders of Rights (i) prior to the close of business on the Flip-In Date, in any respect and (ii) after the close of business on the Flip-In Date, to make any changes that the Company may deem necessary or desirable and which shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of Rights generally or in order to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision contained herein which may be inconsistent with any other provisions herein or otherwise defective. Upon the delivery of a certificate from an appropriate officer of the Company which states that the proposed supplement or amendment is in compliance with the terms of this provision, the Rights Agent shall execute such supplement or amendment. The Rights Agent will duly execute and deliver any supplement or amendment hereto requested by the company which satisfies the terms of the preceding sentence provided, however, that the Rights Agent shall not be obligated to enter into any supplement or amendment under any provision hereunder that affects the Right Agent's own rights, duties, obligations or immunities under the Agreement.
Supplements and Amendments
5.5 . (a) If the Company elects not to issue certificates representing fractional shares upon exercise of Rights, the Company shall, in lieu thereof, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, either (a) evidence such fractional shares by depository receipts issued pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company and a depository selected by it, providing that each holder of a depository receipt shall have all of the rights, privileges and preferences to which such holder would be entitled as a Beneficial Owner of such fractional share, or (b) sell such shares on behalf of the holders of Right and pay to the registered holder of such Rights the appropriate fraction of price per share received upon such sale.
Fractional Shares
(b) Whenever a payment for fractional Rights or fractional shares is to be made by the Rights Agent, the Company shall (i) promptly prepare and deliver to the Rights Agent a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the facts related to such payments and the prices and/or formulas utilized in calculating such payments, and (ii) provide sufficient monies to the Rights Agent in the form of fully collected funds to make such payments. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying upon such a certificate and shall have no duty with respect, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any payment for fractional shares under any Section of this Agreement related to the payment of fractional Rights or fractional shares unless and until the Rights Agent shall have received such a certificate and sufficient monies.
5.6 . Subject to the terms of this Agreement (including Section 3.1(b)), rights of action in respect of this Agreement, other than rights of action vested solely in the Rights Agent, are vested in the respective holders of the Rights; and any holder of any Rights, without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Rights, may, on such holder's own behalf and for such holder's own benefit and the benefit of other holders of Rights, enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, such holder's right to exercise such holder Rights in the manner provided in such holder's Rights Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the o bligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or threatened violations of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.
Rights of Action
5.7 . No holder, as such, of any Rights shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of shares or any other securities which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of such Rights, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Rights Certificate be construed to confer upon the holder of any Rights, as such, any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting shareholders (except as provided in Section 5.8 hereof), or to receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until such Rights shall have been exercised or exchanged in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Holder of Rights Not Deemed a Shareholder
5.8 . In case the Company shall propose after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time (i) to effect or permit occurrence of any Flip-Over Transaction or Event or (ii) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, then, in each such case, the Company shall give, in accordance with Section 5.9 hereof, notice of such proposed action to each holder of a Right and written notice thereof to the Rights Agent, which shall specify the date on which such Flip-Over Transaction or Event, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take place, and such notice shall be so given at least 20 Business Days prior to the date of the taking of such proposed action.

Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are pleased with our revenues and profits for 2005. The fourth quarter was seasonably weak, but remained profitable. We were disappointed in the fourth quarter results for the Underground Group. We continue to develop our dealer distribution network for the Underground Group, but our underabsorbed overhead was significant in the fourth quarter."
"We are starting 2006 with strong backlogs. We will continue to focus on efficient manufacturing and design concepts, production costs, and raw material costs as we strive to improve our gross margins."
Dr. Brock added, "With our backlog up significantly, an improving economy, highway funding legislation in place, our efficiency initiatives, and a strong balance sheet, we are excited about what can be accomplished in growing the business in both revenues and profits."
During the course of the annual audit, management, and the independent auditors, identified significant deficiencies in internal controls primarily related to the adequacy of inventory controls, accounting system access controls, journal entry authorization, and monitoring controls related to Astec Underground, Inc. When aggregated, these deficiencies represent a material weakness in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. The Audit Committee has discussed these matters with management and the Company's independent auditors, and at the direction of the Audit Committee, management has initiated several actions to remedy these significant deficiencies.
Commenting on the identified material weakness, Dr. Brock said, "We have addressed the deficiencies in the internal control procedures at Astec Underground and are taking appropriate action. Despite the material weakness identified in the course of the audit, we remain confident in the reliability of the financial reporting and our preparation of the Company's financial statements."

ITEM 4.01. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.
On June 16, 2006, as approved by the Audit Committee of Astec Industries, Inc. ("Astec") on June 15, 2006, Astec advised Grant Thornton LLP ("Grant Thornton") that it had been dismissed as the independent registered public accounting firm for Astec effective as of such date.
The reports of Grant Thornton on Astec's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that Grant Thornton issued a disclaimer of opinion on both management's assessment of the effectiveness of Astec's internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of Astec's internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, and the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2006 through June 15, 2006, Astec had no disagreements with Grant Thornton on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Grant Thornton, would have caused Grant Thornton to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its report on the consolidated financial statements for such periods.
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, and the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2006 through June 15, 2006, Astec did not consult with Grant Thornton regarding any event identified in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
On June 15, 2006, the Audit Committee of Astec engaged Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") as the new independent registered public accounting firm for Astec. E&Y was Astec's independent registered public accounting prior to the engagement of Grant Thornton on September 10, 2004. During Astec's fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, and the subsequent interim period from January 1, 2006 through June 15, 2006, Astec did not consult E&Y regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on Astec's financial statements nor did Astec consult E&Y regarding any matter that was the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
Astec provided Grant Thornton with a copy of this Form 8-K prior to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and requested that Grant Thornton furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements. A copy of Grant Thornton's letter dated June 20, 2006, is attached as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.

All segments had increased sales for the quarter and are starting the fourth quarter with greatly improved backlogs totaling $125,000,000.
Customers in general are busy and oil prices have moderated from their high in the second quarter. Legislation to confirm federal funding for 2007 seems to be firming up pending the return of Congress from recess. State tax receipts seem to be doing well. Interest rates appear to be stabilizing. We are pleased with the business climate as we enter the fourth quarter and prepare for opportunities in 2007. Our backlogs give us confidence regarding continued growth through next year."

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
Credit Agreement between Astec Industries, Inc. and certain of its Subsidiaries and Wachovia Bank, National Association.
On April 13, 2007, Astec Industries, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (Borrower) entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Wachovia Bank, National Association (Lender) whereby the Lender has agreed to extend to Borrower an unsecured line of credit loan of up to $100,000,000 including a sub-limit for letters of credit of up to $15,000,000. The new credit agreement will replace the secured credit facility the Borrower currently has in place with General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC"). There are currently no outstanding revolving or term loan borrowings under the GECC credit facility.
The effectiveness of the new credit agreement, including access to the facility and the applicability of the principal operative affirmative and negative covenants contained therein, remains subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. The Borrower expects to satisfy such conditions on or about May 1, 2007.
The new credit facility is unsecured and has an original term of three years (which is subject to further extensions as provided therein). The interest rate for borrowings is a function of the Adjusted LIBOR Rate or Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate, as elected by the Borrower, plus a margin based upon a leverage ratio pricing grid ranging between 0.5% and 1.5%. As of March 31, 2007 and if the credit facility was then in effect, the applicable margin based upon the leverage ratio pricing grid would equal 0.5%. The new credit facility requires no principal amortization and interest only payments are due, in the case of loans bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate, monthly in arrears and, in the case of loans bearing at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, at the end of the applicable interest period therefore.

Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
Previously announced Credit Agreement between Astec Industries, Inc. and certain of its Subsidiaries and Wachovia Bank, National Association is now complete.
On April 19, 2007 Astec Industries, Inc and certain of its subsidiaries (the Company) announced that the Company had entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Wachovia Bank, National (Lender) whereby the Lender agreed to extend to the Company an unsecured line of credit loan of up to $100,000,000 including a sub-limit for letters of credit of up to $15,000,000. At the time of the announcement, he effectiveness of the new credit agreement, including access to the facility and the applicability of the principal operative affirmative and negative covenants contained therein, remained subject to the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. The closing conditions have now been satisfied and the agreement is now effective.
The new credit agreement replaced the secured credit facility the Company previously had in place with General Electric Capital Corporation ("GECC"). There were no outstanding revolving or term loan borrowings under the GECC credit facility at the time of transition.
The new credit facility is unsecured and has an original term of three years (which is subject to further extensions as provided therein). The interest rate for borrowings is a function of the Adjusted LIBOR Rate or Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate, as elected by the Borrower, plus a margin based upon a leverage ratio pricing grid ranging between 0.5% and 1.5%. As of May 1, 2007, the applicable margin based upon the leverage ratio pricing grid would be equal to 0.5% if any amounts were outstanding under the agreement. The new credit facility requires no principal amortization and interest only payments are due, in the case of loans bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBOR Market Index Rate, monthly in arrears and, in the case of loans bearing at the Adjusted LIBOR Rate, at the end of the applicable interest period therefore.

ITEM: Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
ITEM: Financial Statements and Exhibits
 
 

  Astec Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTE) today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of Peterson, Inc. (Peterson) located in Eugene, Oregon.
CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, (June 11, 2007).
 Peterson is a leading manufacturer of whole-tree pulpwood chippers, horizontal grinders and blower trucks.  Founded in 1961 as Wilbur Peterson & Sons, a heavy construction company, the company expanded into manufacturing in 1982 to develop equipment to suit their land clearing and construction needs. By 1990 Peterson had developed its first wood recycling machine and since that time continuous development has led to the existing product line. The company will continue to operate from its Eugene headquarters under the name Peterson Pacific Corp.  The transaction is expected to close during the third calendar quarter.
   
 
 The total purchase price for the acquisition is approximately $34 million.  Such amount includes $7 million to payoff outstanding Peterson debt and $7 million to purchase the real estate currently used by Peterson in a separate transaction, but excludes a $3 million potential earn-out payment.
   
 Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, We are delighted to welcome Peterson Pacific Corp. to the Astec Industries family of companies. The acquisition of Peterson adds a new dimension to the range of products manufactured by Astec Industries, Inc. The processing equipment manufactured by Peterson has numerous components that closely resemble those found on our track-mounted crushers and Roadtec milling machines. We believe that we can enhance the operations of Peterson by improving purchasing practices, reducing outsourced assembly items and by using our best practices. Our Focus Group initiatives are very applicable to Petersons business. Additionally, the existing leadership team of Neil Peterson, President, and Larry Cumming, Chief Executive Officer will continue to manage the business after the acquisition.

International sales accounted for $69.8 million of revenues during the second quarter of 2007 compared to $53.5 million during the second quarter of 2006.  The Company reported net income of $18.5 million for the second quarter of 2007 compared to net income of $12.4 million for the second quarter of 2006 for an increase of 49.2%.

We will continue to focus on these initiatives and will monitor inflation closely and take the necessary actions to maintain or improve margins.
We believe that our increase in sales reflects a strong economy, an overwhelming need for road improvements resulting in state initiatives to increase funding, market acceptance of new products, improving market share, increasing sales of recycling equipment and strong international sales.

Domestic sales accounted for $131.7 million during the third quarter of 2007 compared to $116.1 million during the third quarter of 2006.  International sales accounted for $74.5 million of revenues during the third quarter of 2007 compared to $55.4 million during the third quarter of 2006.  The Company reported net income of $11.6 million for the third quarter of 2007 compared to net income of $10.0 million for the third quarter of 2006 for an increase of 16.0%.  Net income for the third quarter of 2007 was $0.51 per diluted share compared to $0.46 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2006 for a 10.9% increase.

Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased with the 2007 third quarter sales increase of 20.2% compared to the third quarter of 2006.  The gross margin for the quarter was  impacted by the shipment of some new models of equipment.  S,G,A&E expenses were  impacted by an increase in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan expense due to the increase in the value of our stock.  We also increased our costs related to salaries and benefits by hiring additional staff in order to generate and support increased sales volumes.  We are excited about the prospects for the fourth quarter and look forward to finishing another strong year.
We believe that our increase in sales reflects a strong economy, an overwhelming need for road improvements resulting in state initiatives to increase funding, market acceptance of new products, improving market share, increasing sales of recycling equipment and strong international sales. The international demand has steadily increased throughout 2007 which should be indicative of strong international sales for the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to 2006.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (July 21, 2008)  Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their second quarter ended June 30, 2008.
Net income for the second quarter of 2008 was $0.93 per diluted share compared to $0.83 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2007 for a 12.0% increase.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2008 were $277.7 million compared with $226.4 million for the second quarter of 2007 for a 22.7% increase.  Excluding revenues attributable to Peterson Pacific Corp., which was acquiredin July, 2007, revenues for the second quarter were $256.0 million for a 13.1% increase.  Domestic sales accounted for $184.7 million during the second quarter of 2008 compared to $156.6 million during the second quarter of 2007.  International sales accounted for $93.0 million of revenues during the second quarter of 2008 compared to $69.8 million during the second quarter of 2007.  The Company reported net income of $21.1 million for the second quarter of 2008 compared to net income of $18.5 million for the second quarter of 2007 for an increase of 14.1%.  The Companys backlog at June 30, 2008 was $264.6 million compared to $235.4 million at June 30, 2007 (including backlog attributable to Peterson) for a 12.4% increase.
 
Consolidated financial statements for the second quarter ended June 30, 2008 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased with the Companys second quarter earnings.  International sales continue to be strong, accounting for 33.5% of the second quarter volume.  Gross margin for the quarter declined from 26.0% for the second quarter of 2007 to 23.9% for the second quarter of 2008.  Rapid increases in the costs of steel and components were the primary reasons for the decline in gross margin.  Year-to-date gross margin for 2008 has only declined 1.1% compared to the first half of 2007.  We anticipate that inflation will continue to be a challenge during the second half of 2008.  Some of our subsidiaries have implemented two price increases this year and are reviewing the need for additional increases to maintain or improve gross margins. We will continue our other initiatives to deal with inflation.  We look forward to the second half of 2008 with a backlog at June 30, 2008 of $264.6 million compared to $263.0 million at March 31, 2008.  Some of the deliveries in the backlog extend beyond the third quarter of 2008.  The cost of oil and asphalt continues to cause states to increase the percentage of recycled materials used for highway paving.  Asphalt equipment sales have improved and should continue to benefit from recycle related equipment sales.

Item 1.01.  Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
 
 
On August 5, 2008, Astec Industries, Inc., a Tennessee corporation (Astec), and the shareholders (the Sellers) of Dillman Equipment, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation (Dillman), entered into a definitive agreement (the Agreement) which provides for Astecs acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Dillman.   The purchase is expected to close on or about October 1, 2008.
 
 
In  connection  with  this transaction, Astec entered into a separate agreement  with  two  of  the  Dillman  shareholders to purchase all of the outstanding  capital  stock  of  Double  L  Investments,  Inc., a Wisconsin corporation  which  owns  the real estate and improvements used by Dillman.  In  addition, the terms of an employment contract with Brian Dillman were agreed upon.
 
 
The agreements stipulate a combined purchase price of $21,300,000 to be paid to the Sellers.  Astec has deposited $8,000,000 into escrow coincident with the signing of the Agreement.  The transactions will be funded from available cash on hand.
 
 
Dillmans revenues for the most recent two fiscal years (ending on September 30, 2008) are expected to average approximately $37,000,000 per year.
 
 
Consummation of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including (i) the receipt of any authorizations, consents, registrations or similar approvals required under any applicable law, and (ii) absence of any law, order or injunction prohibiting the transaction. Moreover, each partys obligation to consummate the transaction is subject to certain other conditions, including but not limited to (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) compliance of the other party with its covenants contained in the Agreement, (iii) Dillman having obtained the consents required by the Agreement, and (iv) the execution by each party of certain ancillary agreements. The Agreement also contains customary provisions concerning termination, indemnifications and remedies.  In addition, the Agreement contains representations and warranties Astec, Dillman, and the Sellers made to each other as of the date of the Agreement or other specific dates, and such representations and warranties should not be relied upon by any other person. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for the purposes of the contract among Astec, Dillman, and the Sellers and are subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by those parties in connection with negotiating the Agreement. Accordingly, investors should not rely on the representations and warranties as accurate or complete or characterizations of the actual state of facts as of any specified date since they are modified in important part by the underlying disclosure schedules, are subject to a contractual standard of materiality different from that generally applicable to stockholders and were used for the purpose of allocating risk among Astec, Dillman, and the Sellers rather than establishing matters as facts.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (October 21, 2008) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2008.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2008 were $237.4 million compared with $206.2million for the third quarter of 2007 for a 15.1% increase.  Domestic sales accounted for $135.3 million during the third quarter of 2008 compared to $131.7 million during the third quarter of 2007.  International sales accounted for $102.1 million of revenues during the third quarter of 2008 compared to $74.5 million during the third quarter of 2007.  The Company reported net income of $16.0 million for the third quarter of 2008 compared to net income of $11.6 million for the third quarter of 2007 for an increase of 37.9%.  Net income for the third quarter of 2008 was $0.71 per diluted share compared to $0.51 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2007 for a 39.2% increase.
 
The Companys backlog at September 30, 2008 was $255.7 million compared to $239.9 million at September 30, 2007 for a 6.6% increase.
Consolidated financial statements for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008 and additional information related to segment revenues, profits, and backlog are attached to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are very pleased with our third quarter results.  With our present backlog, we expect a strong finish for the year.  The injection of $8.0 billion into the Highway Trust Fund ensures full funding at the federal level for 2009.  Many states, however, are experiencing lower tax revenues as a result of the economic downturn and, in particular, the higher oil prices.  The current trend toward lower oil prices should positively impact the state fuel tax collections as drivers return to the road and reduce the price of asphalt resulting in a greater number of road building contracts.  Furthermore, the growth in the energy and mining portions of our business and the strong possibility of a stimulus package for roads and bridges gives us hope of continued strength and growth in 2009.
Investor Conference Call and Web Simulcast
Astec will conduct a conference call on October 21, 2008, at 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time to review its third quarter results as well as current business conditions.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (February 24, 2009)  Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2008.  Revenues for 2008 were $974 million and net income for 2008 was $63 million.  Net income was $2.80 per diluted share for 2008 compared to $2.53 per diluted share for 2007, for an increase of $0.27, or 11% per diluted share.
Revenues for 2008 were $974 million compared with $869 million for 2007, for an increase of 12%.  Domestic sales were $621 million for 2008, or 64% of 2008 revenues, compared to domestic sales of $591 million for 2007, or 68% of 2007 revenues.  International sales were $353 million for 2008, a 27% increase over 2007, or 36% of 2008 revenues, compared to international sales of $278 million for 2007, or 32% of 2007 revenues.  Gross margins for 2008 compared to 2007 decreased 10 basis points.  The Company reported net income of $63 million, or $2.80 per diluted share, for 2008 compared with a net income of $57 million, or $2.53 per diluted share for 2007, resulting in an 11% increase in diluted earnings per share.
Income from operations increased 6% from $87 million in 2007 to $92 million in 2008.
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008 were $195 million compared with $221 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, for a decrease of 12%.  Domestic sales were $130 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, or 67% of 2008 fourth quarter revenues, compared to domestic sales of $136 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, or 62% of 2007 fourth quarter revenues.  International sales were $65 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, or 33% of 2008 fourth quarter revenues, compared to international sales of $85 million for the fourth quarter of 2007, or 38% of 2007 fourth quarter revenues.  Other income in the fourth quarter was primarily the gain on sale of investments.  The Company reported net income of $9 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2008 compared with net income of $11 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2007, resulting in a 24% decrease in diluted earnings per share.
Consolidated financial statements for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2008 and additional information related to segment revenues, profits and backlogs are attached as addenda to this press release.
The Companys backlog at December 31, 2008 was $193 million compared to $281 million at December 31, 2007, for an $88 million decrease or 31%.  The international backlog at December 31, 2008 was $88 million compared to $89 million at the end of 2007.  The domestic backlog at December 31, 2008 was $105 million compared to $192 million at the end of 2007, a decrease of 45%.  The aggregate segment accounted for 52% of the domestic backlog decrease and the asphalt segment accounted for 40% of the domestic backlog decrease.  We believe there were several reasons for the reduced backlog, including the general downturn in economic conditions, and uncertainty regarding the proposed stimulus package and its effect on the rebuilding of the countrys infrastructure.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased with our 2008 results.  During the last three months of the year, we saw the market go from optimistic yet cautious to completely pessimistic and frozen.  The Companys sales grew 20% in the first nine months, but the fourth quarter slowdown only allowed us to finish the year with 12% sales growth.  The credit crisis that started in September practically stopped investment and spending worldwide, slowing many of our businesses almost to a creep.  Those businesses with strong backlogs were able to continue operating at reasonable levels but those that typically do not have very strong backlogs were forced to slow production dramatically and lay off personnel.  During the fourth quarter, the dollar strengthened against other currencies impacting the international markets.
During the year, we acquired Dillman Equipment Company of Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.  Dillman is a well respected manufacturer of asphalt plants and gives Astec, Inc. a third asphalt plant manufacturing facility with experienced personnel.  It also adds an additional range of products to the Astec asphalt plant offering.  We started Astec Australia, which acquired most of the assets of Q-Pave Pty Ltd, which had served as our dealer in Australia for Astec, Roadtec, Heatec, CEI Enterprises, Astec Underground and Carlson Paving Products.  We hope this distribution will continue to grow by adding other products from the Astec family of companies.  Astec Australia adds value to the products by providing turn-key installations, after sales service, and parts distribution.  The acquisitions did not have a significant effect upon the fourth quarter or year.
We believe many states have delayed finalizing highway improvement projects in anticipation of receiving stimulus funds dedicated to infrastructure.  The stimulus legislation will require that approximately 50% of the funds be placed under contract within 120 days of adoption.  This has encouraged states to delay awarding of highway bids so they can obtain their complete share of the stimulus funds.  This has led to a very slow start of the year and will make a very difficult first quarter.  We anticipate that volumes for the balance of the year will improve as contractors put their equipment back to work and order additional equipment for the expected higher volume of work.  We anticipate the first beneficiaries will be our Asphalt and Mobile Asphalt Paving Groups that build asphalt plants, recycling equipment, and paving equipment.
Dr. Brock continued, The Company enters 2009 with a very strong balance sheet and little debt.  The debt that we have is classified as current and we will focus on asset management to minimize or eliminate the debt.  Our current bank agreement extends through May, 2011. At December 31, our credit line availability was $86 million.  We are positioned to face the difficult market and to take advantage of available opportunities.

News Release
  1725 Shepherd Road  | Chattanooga, TN  37421  | Phone (423) 899-5898  | Fax (423) 899-4456
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (April 21, 2009) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their first quarter ended March 31, 2009.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2009 were $205 million compared with $263million for the first quarter of 2008 for a 22% decrease.  Domestic sales accounted for 64% and international sales for 36% of revenues during the first quarter of 2009 compared to 65% for domestic sales and 35% for international sales during the first quarter of 2008.  The Company reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $7 million for the first quarter of 2009 compared to net income attributable to controlling interest of $18 million for the first quarter of 2008 for a decrease of 58%.   Net income attributable to controlling interest for the first quarter of 2009 was $0.33 per diluted share compared to $0.78 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2008 for a 58% decrease.
 
The Companys backlog at March 31, 2009 was $140 million compared to $275 million at March 31, 2008 for a 49% decrease.
Consolidated financial information for the first quarter ended March 31, 2009 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, In light of the severe economic downturn, we are pleased with our first quarter results.  The anticipation of the stimulus funding encouraged many state Departments of Transportation to delay letting jobs for five to six months starting in October, 2008.  As a result many of our customers completed their open jobs with few new jobs being awarded by states.  In April, we have seen very large numbers of highway projects being released by the state Departments of Transportation.  We are experiencing an increase in business in our Mobile Group and continued business in the Asphalt Group.  Our other companies continue to be slow.
We believe the economy hit bottom in late February; however, we believe the recovery will continue to be slow.  During this period our strategy will be to aggressively develop new products and enhance existing products.  We are developing products that will broaden the number of industries that we serve and that will be counter cyclical to our existing businesses.  Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to move forward with product developments that will make us stronger when the economy recovers.
Dr. Brock continued, Due to the severe and rapid downturn that occurred in the fourth quarter, our customers are cautious and are buying equipment only after getting the jobs.   Our lower backlog allows us to react to customer needs more quickly and will hopefully prevent us from losing sales due to lengthy deliveries when backlogs are higher.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (July 20, 2009)  Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their second quarter ended June 30, 2009.
The Company reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $7.7 million for the second quarter of 2009 compared to net income of $21.1 million for the second quarter of 2008 for a decrease of 63.5%.  Net income attributable to controlling interest for the second quarter of 2009 was $0.34 per diluted share compared to $0.93 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2008 for a 63.4% decrease.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2009 were $188.8 million compared with $277.7 million for the second quarter of 2008 for a 32.0% decrease.  Domestic sales accounted for $129.2 million during the second quarter of 2009 compared to $184.7 million during the second quarter of 2008.  International sales accounted for $59.6 million of revenues during the second quarter of 2009 compared to $93.0 million during the second quarter of 2008 and accounted for 31.6% of total sales for the second quarter of 2009 as compared to 33.5% for the second quarter of 2008.
The Companys backlog at June 30, 2009 was $133.6 million compared to $267.9 million at June 30, 2008 for a 50.1% decrease.
Consolidated financial statements for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, During the second quarter, we saw a pick-up in demand for the mobile asphalt paving group business and continued strength of the asphalt group business.  However, the other businesses continue to be weak.  The underground business, which primarily serves the energy and residential business, has turned very weak.  Despite the lower volumes and revenues, we were able to maintain profitability and saw a slight improvement in our gross margins over the first quarter.
    Although the stimulus package funds allocated to roads and bridges were only 3.5% of the total stimulus package, it has been helpful for the asphalt and mobile asphalt paving segments of our business.  We anticipate that the impact of the stimulus package will continue to be beneficial over the next 18 months.  With the current backlog and incoming orders, we believe revenue in the third quarter will be generally consistent with second quarter revenues.  Revenues could vary dependent upon permitting of jobs, customer financing arrangements and whether or not jobsites are ready to accept our equipment.  International sales continue to be strong, accounting for 33.7% of the year-to-date volume.

NEWS RELEASE
   1725 Shepherd Road  |  Chattanooga, TN  37421  |  Phone (423) 899-5898  |  Fax 899-4456
Astec Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:ASTE) announced today the acquisition of Industrial Mechanical & Integration (IMI) located in Walkerton Ontario, Canada. IMI is a small company with unique machine technology used to make wood pellets. Rick Minke, President of IMI and key employees have agreed to remain with the company to further develop and promote this new technology. IMI has been testing the technology for two years and is now making the first group of production machines. According to Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive of Astec Industries, Inc., We are excited about the potential of this new technology. Conventional pellet production machines were designed for easy to use materials and do not always work well with a wide variety of wood species. With this acquisition, Astec Industries, Inc. can provide a one stop solution to customers desiring to own a pellet plant that can process material from round wood all the way to the finished product.  We are well positioned to be a turnkey supplier to the growing wood pellet industry. Many companies in the Astec Industries, Inc. family of companies already make components needed by this market. The acquisition of IMI is in line with our continuing effort to grow the renewable fuel portion of our business.  We believe wood pellets will be an important part of the renewable energy standards that are being adopted in the USA and around the world.
CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, (September 30, 2009)

News Release
1725 Shepherd Road  |  Chattanooga, TN  37421  |  Phone (423) 899-5898  |  Fax (423) 899-4456
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (February 23, 2010) 
Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for the fourth quarter and for the year ended December 31, 2009.  Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $177.9 million and the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $15.5 million.  The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2009, including a non-cash impairment charge of $0.61 per diluted share, was $0.69 per diluted share compared to net income of $8.0 million or $0.38 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2008.  Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, While we are disappointed with the year-end results for 2009, we are happy to have weathered the economic downturn with a strong balance sheet, no bank debt for money borrowed and over $40 million in cash and equivalents in the bank.
 
The 2009 fourth quarter results include an intangible impairment charge of approximately $17.0 million ($13.6 million after tax, or $0.61 per share). The impairment charge primarily relates to goodwill attributed to two acquisitions completed prior to the current economic downturn.  The net loss for the fourth quarter of 2009 before impairment charge was $0.08 per share.  The attached statement of operations contains a separate line item for the impairment charge and attached is a reconciliation to the GAAP measurement.
 
Net sales for 2009 were $738.1 million compared with $973.7 million for 2008, for a decrease of 24.2%.  Domestic net sales were $465.5 million for 2009, a 25.0% decrease compared to 2008.  Domestic net sales were 63.1% of 2009 total net sales compared to 63.8% of 2008 total net sales.  International sales were $272.6 million for 2009, a 22.7% decrease compared to 2008.  Gross margins for 2009 compared to 2008 decreased 330 basis points.  Income from operations decreased 89.2% from $91.8 million in 2008 to $9.9 million, including the intangible impairment charge of $17.0 million in 2009.  The Company reported net income of $3.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share for 2009 compared with a net income of $63.1 million, or $2.80 per diluted share for 2008.
 
 
Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $177.9 million compared with $195.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, for a decrease of 9.0%.  Domestic sales were $103.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, a 20.9% decrease compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 or 58.0% of 2009 fourth quarter revenues, compared to domestic sales of $130.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, or 66.7% of 2008 fourth quarter revenues.  International sales were $74.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, a 15.1% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008 or 42.0% of 2009 fourth quarter revenues, compared to international sales of $65.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, or 33.2% of 2008 fourth quarter revenues.

Consolidated financial information for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2009 and additional information related to segment revenues, profits and backlogs are attached as addenda to this press release.
 
The Companys total backlog at December 31, 2009 was $135.1 million compared to $193.3 million at December 31, 2008, for a decrease of $58.2 million or 30.0%.  The international backlog at December 31, 2009 was $62.2 million compared to $87.7 million at the end of 2008 for a decrease of 29.0%.  The domestic backlog at December 31, 2009 was $72.9 million compared to $105.6 million at the end of 2008, a decrease of 31.0%.  The asphalt segment accounted for 78.0% of the total domestic backlog decrease and the aggregate segment backlog accounted for 57.0% of the total international backlog decrease.
 
Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, also commented that, 2009 was a year in which we saw a very deep downturn in the U.S. economy occurring very rapidly.  Half of our companies saw revenue drops for the year in the 40% to 50% range.  Although roads and bridges only represented 3% of the federal stimulus package, it was very helpful to our asphalt and mobile equipment company businesses. The engineering for projects to resurface or rehabilitate roads generally can be done very quickly and therefore these jobs were among the first to be awarded.  Due to the short timetables required by the federal stimulus package, additional equipment was required particularly in the mobile paving side of the business.  As the dollar strengthened in late 2008, we saw a significant drop in our international business which continued through the first six months of 2009.  We began to see improvements in our international business with the weakening of the dollar and many countries also passed stimulus packages with strong emphasis on infrastructure improvements.
 
Dr. Brock continued As we look forward to 2010, we are hopeful of a slight improvement in our companies that experienced the worst downturn.  The continuing indecision on a new multi-year Highway Bill and the timing of the funding of any additional stimulus package for roads, however, makes our customers reluctant to purchase equipment until market visibility improves.  On a positive note, we believe the lack of expenditures is creating a pent up demand which should be very beneficial whenever a new Highway Bill is passed.  We also believe that we will see continuing improvement in our international business.  Despite the downturn in 2009, we have continued to invest in the research and development of new products.  This investment has resulted in a number of new green products and we hope to generate additional revenues with these products in 2010 and beyond.

News Release
  1725 Shepherd Road  | Chattanooga, TN  37421  | Phone (423) 899-5898  | Fax (423) 899-4456
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (April 20, 2010) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their first quarter ended March 31, 2010.
Revenues for the first quarter of 2010 were $193.5 million compared with $205.3million for the first quarter of 2009 for a 5.7% decrease.  Domestic sales accounted for 67.0% and international sales for 33.0% of revenues during the first quarter of 2010 compared to 64.3% for domestic sales and 35.7% for international sales during the first quarter of 2009.  The Company reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $8.8 million for the first quarter of 2010 compared to $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2009 for an increase of 18.9%.   Earnings for the first quarter of 2010 were $.39 per diluted share compared to $.33 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2009 for an 18.2% increase.
 
The Companys backlog at March 31, 2010 was $134.8 million compared to $140.1 million at March 31, 2009 for a 3.8% decrease.
Consolidated financial information for the first quarter ended March 31, 2010 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We continued to see weak volumes in each of our groups except the Mobile Asphalt Paving Group during the first quarter.  However, due to cost reductions made in 2009, our net income improved.  We believe we may  have reached the bottom of the economic cycle in the fourth quarter of 2009 and hope to see modest improvements in the remainder of the year helped by more parts sales and an increase in international sales.
Dr. Brock continued, Our customers continue to be reluctant to make large expenditures due to the uncertainty regarding state and federal taxes, healthcare reform, proposed cap and trade legislation and federal highway spending.  As a result, we will continue to adjust our businesses to reach more international markets and different industries, such as mining and energy.

News Release
   1725 Shepherd Road  |  Chattanooga, TN  37421  |  Phone (423) 899-5898  |  Fax 899-4456
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (July 20, 2010)  Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their second quarter ended June 30, 2010.
 
    The Company reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $10.3 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $7.7 million for the second quarter of 2009 for an increase of 33.8%.  Net income attributable to controlling interest for the second quarter of 2010 was $0.45 per diluted share compared to $0.34 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2009 for a 32.4% increase.
   
Revenues for the second quarter of 2010 were $209.2 million compared with $188.8 million for the second quarter of 2009 for a 10.8% increase.  Domestic sales were $129.2 million during the second quarter of 2010 compared to $129.2 million during the second quarter of 2009.  International sales accounted for $80.0 million of revenues during the second quarter of 2010 compared to $59.6 million during the second quarter of 2009 and accounted for 38.2% of total sales for the second quarter of 2010 compared to 31.6% for the second quarter of 2009.
The Companys backlog at June 30, 2010 was $139.7 million compared to $133.6 million at June 30, 2009 for a 4.6% increase.
Consolidated financial statements for the second quarter ended June 30, 2010 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, Considering the state of our economy, we are pleased with our second quarter results.  We continue to develop and introduce new products and apply existing products in the mining and energy industries, and grow international sales.
Dr. Brock continued, We remain concerned about the lack of action by Congress on a new 6-year highway bill.  Our customers will remain cautious and reluctant to make major capital expenditure commitments until a bill is passed in Washington.  In general, customers are only purchasing equipment needed for current jobs.  Customers continue to purchase components, assemblies and parts for maintaining or increasing production, but a multi-year highway bill should give our customers the confidence to expand their production capacity by purchasing entire plants or installations.

News Release

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (October 19, 2010) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2010.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2010 were $177.9 million compared with $166.1million for the third quarter of 2009 for a 7.1% increase.  Domestic sales were $98.6 million during the third quarter of 2010 compared to $101.3 million during the third quarter of 2009 for a decrease of 2.6%.  International sales were $79.3 million during the third quarter of 2010 compared to $64.8 million during the third quarter of 2009 for an increase of 22.4%.  The Company reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $7.4 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to net income attributable to controlling interest of $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2009 for an increase of 124.2%.  Net income attributable to controlling interest for the third quarter of 2010 was $0.32 per diluted share compared to $0.15 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2009 for a 113.3% increase.
 
The Companys backlog at September 30, 2010 was $145.6 million compared to $144.3 million at September 30, 2009 for a 0.9% increase.
Consolidated financial statements for the third quarter ended September 30, 2010 and additional information related to segment revenues, profits, and backlog are attached to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We saw a marginal improvement in revenue for the third quarter, and a significant improvement in our net income.  This increase was attributable to the downsizing we did in 2009, more productive fabricating and machine tools, increased parts sales and improved utilization of capacity.  During the quarter, weakness in the domestic markets was offset by increases in international sales and parts sales.
We expect to see a continued weakness in domestic sales for the next 12 to 24 months.  This could change with passage of a new Federal Highway Bill. To sustain and grow our revenue during these uncertain times, we are increasing our sales, service and parts personnel throughout the world.  We are also increasing our presence in the mining industries and growing our product offering in the energy business.
 
 
 
 
Dr. Brock continued, Considering the severity of the continuing economic downturn, we are pleased with our results and feel that we are positioned to take advantage of any opportunities that may occur.

Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented that, We are very pleased with the 2010 sales level.  The recession that started in September 2008 was deep and fast.  Our management right sized their businesses under extremely difficult conditions.   For significant domestic growth, we need a responsible six-year highway bill which should give customers the vision to make larger capital investments.
Dr. Brock continued As we look forward to 2011, we expect continued growth in international sales.  We continue to seek domestic and international acquisitions.  We are expanding Astec Australia and will use that business model to sell multiple product lines in other international locations.  Without a highway bill, we expect domestic sales to remain weak; however we hope our new and improved products and increased international sales will make up that shortfall.  We see 2011 revenue improving over 2010 and expect to return to slow growth.

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (July 25, 2011)  Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their second quarter ended June 30, 2011.
The Company reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $14.1 million for the second quarter of 2011 compared to $10.3 million for the second quarter of 2010 for an increase of 36.9%.  Net income attributable to controlling interest for the second quarter of 2011 was $0.61 per diluted share compared to $0.45 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2010 for a 35.6% increase.
Revenues for the second quarter of 2011 were $247.8 million compared with $209.2 million for the second quarter of 2010 for an 18.5% increase.  Domestic sales were $139.5 million during the second quarter of 2011 compared to $129.2 million during the second quarter of 2010.  International sales accounted for $108.3 million of revenues during the second quarter of 2011 compared to $80.0 million during the second quarter of 2010 and accounted for 43.7% of total sales for the second quarter of 2011 compared to 38.2% for the second quarter of 2010.
The Companys backlog at June 30, 2011 was $217.1 million compared to $139.7 million at June 30, 2010 for a 55.4% increase.  Domestic backlog increased 64.2% and international backlog increased 49.2%.
Consolidated financial statements for the second quarter ended June 30, 2011 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased with the performance of the Company during the second quarter especially considering the tough economic conditions that continue to persist.  The 18.5% increase in revenues was largely attributable to the increase in international sales which accounted for 43.7% of the total sales during the second quarter.  The lack of a long-term highway bill and concern about a solution to rising deficits are causing our domestic customers to continue to be cautious about making capital investments.  We continue to investigate a number of potential acquisitions that will be complementary to our existing businesses.
 
 
 
Dr. Brock continued, On July 31, 2011, F. McKamy Hall will step down from the position of Chief Financial Officer.  McKamy will become Vice President of Business Development and will head up our efforts in seeking and investigating opportunities for expansion of our businesses while still reporting directly to me.  McKamy began his career with Astec in 1987 as Corporate Controller and became Vice President and Chief Financial Officer in 1998.  I sincerely appreciate and want to thank McKamy for his years of service, assistance, and leadership as our Chief Financial Officer.  Fortunately, McKamys contributions to our success are not over.  I look forward to continuing to work with him as we seek to continue to grow our business.
David Silvious will be promoted from Corporate Controller to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  David has been with Astec for twelve years and was in public accounting seven years prior to joining Astec.  He is a CPA and has an MBA.  David has been working for twelve years under McKamys guidance and supervision and has served as Corporate Controller since 2005.  We are pleased and excited about his new duties and position.
Also, Steve Anderson will be  promoted to Vice President of Administration and will retain his responsibilities as Corporate Secretary and Director of Investor Relations.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (October 25, 2011) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2011.
Revenues for the third quarter of 2011 were $214.6 million compared with $177.9million for the third quarter of 2010 for a 20.6% increase.  Domestic sales were $127.3 million during the third quarter of 2011 compared to $98.6 million during the third quarter of 2010 for an increase of 29.1%.  International sales were $87.3 million during the third quarter of 2011 compared to $79.3 million during the third quarter of 2010 for an increase of 10.1%.  The Company reported net income attributable to controlling interest of $7.7 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared to net income attributable to controlling interest of $7.4 million for the third quarter of 2010 for an increase of 4.1%.  Net income attributable to controlling interest for the third quarter of 2011 was $0.34 per diluted share compared to $0.32 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2010 for a 6.3% increase.
 
The Companys backlog at September 30, 2011 was $221.5 million compared to $145.6 million at September 30, 2010 for a 52.1% increase.
Consolidated financial statements for the third quarter ended September 30, 2011 and additional information related to segment revenues, profits, and backlog are attached to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, In the third quarter, we were busy with several business development activities and initiatives.  We completed a $3 million acquisition in Germany, added new facilities in Australia and Germany totaling approximately $7 million, signed a manufacturing joint venture agreement in Brazil which will result in an initial investment of $12 million and completed the GEFCO and STECO acquisition in early October for $30.8 million.  These activities represent an investment in our future business and we look forward to their growth and success.
We were pleased with our results for the third quarter, despite a number of charges that negatively affected net income during the quarter.  We incurred $3.3 million or $0.10 per diluted share in R&D related expenses. These expenses related to further development of the prototype wood pellet plant and pellet press, improvements to our crushing line of equipment and concrete plants, development of a line of hot water heaters and pump trailers for oil and natural gas fracking operations and development of a new Peterson micro-chipper. We also had an unusually high volume of intercompany sales this quarter which resulted in $1.9 million or $.06 per diluted share of profit being deferred until future quarters.  The majority of these sales were to our subsidiary in Australia for distribution into that country.
Dr. Brock continued, In late September we were awarded a contract to supply asphalt plants to the U.S. Army that could amount to $89 million in sales over the next 5 years.  As these contingent sales become firm orders they will be reflected in our backlog.  Considering the overall condition of the domestic economy and the uncertainty in Washington, we continue to be pleased with the companys performance.  We believe during the next six months we may see a new, enhanced six-year highway bill which should give more certainty to our domestic customers and hopefully we will see continued improvement in our domestic business.

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (April 24, 2012) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their first quarter ended March 31, 2012.  Net sales for the first quarter of 2012 were $266.6 million compared to $230.2million for the first quarter of 2011, a 16% increase.  Earnings for the first quarter of 2012 were $12.2 million or $0.53 per diluted share compared to earnings for the first quarter of 2011 of $10.1 million or $0.44 per diluted share, an increase of $0.09 or 20% per diluted share.  
 
International sales increased 27%, from $82.7 million for the first quarter of 2011 to $105.2 million for the first quarter of 2012.  Domestic sales were $161.4 million for the first quarter of 2012 compared to $147.5 million for the first quarter of 2011, a 9% increase.    
The Companys domestic backlog increased 30%, from $124.8 million at March 31, 2011 to $162.8 million at March 31, 2012.  The international backlog at March 31, 2012 was $122.8 million, a 12% decrease from the March 31, 2011 international backlog of $139.9 million.

Consolidated financial information for the first quarter ended March 31, 2012 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, We are pleased with our sales and earnings growth during the first quarter of 2012.  Our sales growth was in line with our expectations but our gross margins are not where we want them. Although they improved over the fourth quarter of 2011, we will continue to focus on improving our gross margins and refining our manufacturing processes on our new products.  The expiration of the R&D tax credit at the end of 2011 resulted in a first quarter increase in our effective tax rate to 37% from our historical average of 35%, reducing earnings by $0.02 per share.
Dr. Brock continued, Considering the many uncertainties in our economy and the environment of regulatory change, we believe our revenue and earnings growth validates our strategy over the past two years.  We will continue to actively seek accretive bolt-on acquisitions and to develop new products to meet the needs of our customers.

News Release
  1725 Shepherd Road  | Chattanooga, TN  37421  | Phone (423) 899-5898  | Fax (423) 899-4456
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (July 24, 2012) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their second quarter ended June 30, 2012.  Net sales for the second quarter of 2012 were $253.9 million compared to $247.8million for the second quarter of 2011, a 2% increase.  Earnings for the second quarter of 2012 were $10.4 million or $0.45 per diluted share compared to earnings for the second quarter of 2011 of $14.1 million or $0.61 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.16 or 26% per diluted share.  
 
Domestic sales increased 16% to $161.5 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to $139.5 million for the second quarter of 2011.  International sales were $92.4 million for the second quarter of 2012 compared to $108.3 million for the second quarter of 2011, a 15% decrease.
Net sales for the first half of 2012 were $520.5 million compared to $477.9million for the first half of 2011, a 9% increase.  Earnings for the first half of 2012 were $22.6 million or $0.98 per diluted share compared to earnings for the first half of 2011 of $24.2 million or $1.06 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.08 or 8% per diluted share.  
 
Domestic sales increased 13% to $322.9 million for the first half of 2012 compared to $287.0 million for the first half of 2011.  International sales were $197.6 million for the first half of 2012 compared to $190.9 million for the first half of 2011, a 3% increase.
The Companys domestic backlog increased 44%, from $103.0 million at June 30, 2011 to $148.7 million at June 30, 2012.  The international backlog at June 30, 2012 was $109.6 million, a 19% decrease from the June 30, 2011 international backlog of $134.5 million.  Total backlog increased 9% to $258.3 million from $237.5 million at June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  2011 backlog amounts have been restated to reflect acquisitions made late in 2011.   
Consolidated financial information for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2012 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, During the second quarter, domestic sales were higher overall but we saw significant declines in domestic sales in the Asphalt and Mobile Asphalt Paving groups.  The series of 90-day highway bill continuations that lasted through the second quarter created funding uncertainties at state transportation departments.  This resulted in delays in, and in some cases the elimination of, projects during the peak road construction season.  Our international sales were hurt by a stronger dollar and uncertainty in the global economy.  Although we dont expect to overcome this shortfall this year, the new 27-month highway bill should help demand return to a more normalized level during the second half of the year.  
Dr. Brock continued, In spite of the uncertainty that exists in the global economy, we continue to develop new products and explore new applications for existing products, all with an eye toward diversification.  We continue to look for acquisitions that fit our strategic goals and help us make our customers successful.

News Release
  1725 Shepherd Road  | Chattanooga, TN  37421  | Phone (423) 899-5898  | Fax (423) 899-4456
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (October 26, 2012) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their third quarter ended September 30, 2012.  Net sales for the third quarter of 2012 were $227.0 million compared to $214.6million for the third quarter of 2011, a 6% increase.  Pre-tax earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $10.1 million compared to $9.3 million in the third quarter of 2011, an increase of 9%.  Earnings for the third quarter of 2012 were $6.9 million or $0.30 per diluted share compared to earnings for the third quarter of 2011 of $7.7 million or $0.34 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.04 or 12% per diluted share.  
 
Domestic sales increased 10% to $139.5 million for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $127.3 million for the third quarter of 2011.  International sales were $87.6 million for the third quarter of 2012 compared to $87.3 million for the third quarter of 2011.
Net sales for the first nine months of 2012 were $747.6 million compared to $692.6million for the first nine months of 2011, an 8% increase.  Pre-tax earnings for the first nine months of 2012 were $46.1 million, relatively unchanged from $46.2 million in the first nine months of 2011.  Earnings for the first nine months of 2012 were $29.5 million or $1.28 per diluted share compared to earnings for the first nine months of 2011 of $32.0 million or $1.39 per diluted share, a decrease of $0.11 or 8% per diluted share.  
 
Domestic sales increased 12% to $462.4 million for the first nine months of 2012 compared to $414.2 million for the first nine months of 2011.  International sales were $285.2 million for the first nine months of 2012 compared to $278.3 million for the first nine months of 2011, a 3% increase.
The Companys domestic backlog increased 8%, from $107.9 million at September 30, 2011 to $116.1 million at September 30, 2012.  The international backlog at September 30, 2012 was $124.4 million, a slight increase compared to the September 30, 2011 international backlog of $124.2 million.  Total backlog increased 4% to $240.5 million at September 30, 2012 from $232.1 million September 30, 2011, respectively.  2011 backlog amounts have been restated to reflect acquisitions made late in 2011.   
Consolidated financial information for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2012 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, While we were able to grow sales at 6% for the third quarter, our gross margin remained flat.  Our pre-tax earnings were up 9% during the quarter but our after-tax earnings were impacted by the lack of a research and development credit which was in effect in 2011 but has yet to be approved by Congress for 2012."  
 
 
 
Dr. Brock continued, Our customers continue to be reluctant to spend money on capital investments due to the lack of work and uncertainty in the economy.  The delayed passage of the Federal highway bill caused state transportation departments to delay lettings until late in the construction season.  In addition, the uncertainty surrounding taxes, regulations and the lack of general economic improvement continues to discourage customers from upgrading and expanding their equipment fleets.  We see an opportunity for growth as the economy rebounds over the next few years and the pent up demand for equipment needs to be met.

 Exhibit 99-1
 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (November 1, 2012) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today announced that on October 31, 2012, the Company entered into agreements to sell its American Augers, Inc. subsidiary as well as certain assets related to the Trencor large trencher product line of Astec Underground, Inc. to The Charles Machine Works, Inc. of Perry, Oklahoma for approximately $55 million in cash, subject to closing adjustments.  The Company expects the sale to close before the end of the year.  Not included in the sale are the American Augers vertical oil and gas drilling rig product line and the four-track surface miner product line manufactured at Astec Underground.  The vertical oil and gas drill rig product line will be relocated to GEFCO, Inc., a subsidiary of Astec Industries, Inc. located in Enid, Oklahoma.  The Company will continue to manufacture and expand the surface miner product line at its Astec Underground facility where it will also continue to manufacture its newly developed line of high pressure pump trailers used for fracking and well servicing.  The total revenues of the sold business unit and product line were $42 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012.    
Commenting on the sale, Dr. Brock remarked, We acquired the Trencor operation in 1988 and American Augers in 1999.  These businesses have been very cyclical through the years.  Our strategy has been to buy and grow companies; however, we sold our utility trencher and drill line to Toro earlier this year, and the opportunity became available to sell American Augers and the Trencor line of large trenchers at Astec Underground.  We will continue to manufacture the vertical oil drilling rigs and related equipment by moving that product line to GEFCO.  At Astec Underground in Loudon, Tennessee, we plan to continue to grow our pump trailer business and develop more equipment related to the fracking industry, as well as expand our surface miner product line.  These products are a part of our strategy to grow in the energy and mining industries.
The Company also announced that today the Board of Directors declared a special one-time dividend of $1.00 per share to be paid on December 12, 2012 to shareholders of record as of November 20, 2012.  Commenting on the declaration of the dividend, Dr. Brock said, We have maintained a strong balance sheet for several years but have not found the right acquisitions in which to invest our excess cash.  While acquisitions are still a high priority for us, the Board of Directors decided to declare a special one-time dividend as a tangible return of value to our shareholders while the tax rates are still advantageous.

Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, 2012 has been a year of uncertainty for the U.S. economy.  Although Congress finally passed a new 27-month Federal highway funding bill in July, it was too late in the 2012 construction season to have an impact.  Without the certainty of Federal infrastructure spending, many of our customers were reluctant to make capital expenditures.  With the Federal highway funding bill in place we hope to see the release of some of the pent up demand in preparation for the 2013 construction season.  In spite of the uncertainty in the general economy, we continued to develop new and innovative products, expand our markets and develop more efficient ways to build our products.
 
Dr. Brock continued, Although we were pleased to declare and pay a special dividend of $1.00 per share during the fourth quarter of 2012, we continue to focus on finding the right acquisitions and expansion opportunities.  We have put our capital to work with new manufacturing tools at many of our companies.  We look forward to completing our factory in Brazil and shipping our first wood pelletizer order in 2013.  As the economy begins to recover we will be poised to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves.

News Release
  1725 Shepherd Road  | Chattanooga, TN  37421  | Phone (423) 899-5898  | Fax (423) 899-4456
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (March 4, 2013) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASTE) today announced that the Board of Directors has established a leadership succession plan pursuant to which it intends to transition the position of Chief Executive Officer and President to Benjamin G. Brock and the position of Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President to Richard J. Dorris.  Pursuant to the succession plan, Dr. J.

Norman Smith, who currently serves as the Companys President and Chief Operating Officer, will transition to the role of Vice-Chairman of the Companys Board of Directors.
The Board believes that the succession plan addresses the future leadership needs of the Company and provides a formal process to transition the current leadership roles of Dr. Brock and Mr. Smith to their successors.
The date of the final implementation of the succession plan, including the appointment of new executive officers, has yet to be determined and its timing will be dependent on several factors.  The Board anticipates, however, that the succession plan will be fully implemented prior to the end of the 2013 fiscal year.
Commenting on the succession plan, Dr. Brock remarked, In August of 2012 I completed my 40th year of leading Astec Industries, Inc.  In preparation for long-term succession, our Board of Directors has decided on a plan to promote Ben Brock to Chief Executive Officer and President and Rick Dorris to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.  We are excited to see the progress of this management team.   I am continuing to work as my health permits.  Personally, I hope to mentor Ben and Rick for the foreseeable future and look forward to their active role in managing and running our Company.
Dr. Brock founded the Company in 1972 and has served as its Chief Executive Officer and President for 40 years and as the Chairman of the Board of Directors since 1975.  Mr. Smith has served as the President of the Company since Dr. Brock resigned from that position in August 2012, and Mr. Smith previously served as the Group Vice President  Asphalt since 1998.

Richard J. Dorris has served as Group Vice President  Energy since August 2012 and as President of Heatec, Inc. since 2004.  From 1999 to 2004 he held the positions of National Accounts Manager, Project Manager and Director of Projects for Astec, Inc.  Prior to joining Astec, Inc. he was President of Esstee Manufacturing Company from 1990 to 1999.  
The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share on its common stock, commencing during the Companys second fiscal quarter in 2013.
The amount of future dividends under the Companys dividend policy, and the declaration and payment thereof, will be based upon the Companys financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and restrictions under the Companys existing credit agreement, among other factors, and shall be in compliance with applicable law. The Board of Directors retains the power to modify, suspend or cancel the Companys dividend policy in any manner and at any time as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the future.
Commenting on the adoption of the dividend policy, Dr. Brock said, We believe our core strategy of being acquisitive is the best way we can create long-term value for our shareholders; however, we have chosen to provide our shareholders with a tangible return of value from the cash flow generated by the company.

Exhibit 99-1
 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (April 23, 2013) - Astec Industries, Inc. (Nasdaq:  ASTE) today reported results for their first quarter ended March 31, 2013.  
 
Net sales for the first quarter of 2013 were $247.8 million compared to $252.0million for the first quarter of 2012, a 2% decrease.  Earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2013 were $13.3 million or $0.57 per diluted share compared to $12.0 for the first quarter of 2012 or $0.52 per diluted share, an increase of 10% per diluted share.  
 
 
Domestic sales increased 4% to $161.9 million for the first quarter of 2013 from $155.1 million for the first quarter of 2012.  International sales were $85.9 million for the first quarter of 2013 compared to $96.9 million for the first quarter of 2012, a decrease of 11%.      
 
The Companys domestic backlog increased 5%, from $159.7 million at March 31, 2012 to $167.3 million at March 31, 2013.  The international backlog at March 31, 2013 was $109.2 million, a 6% decrease from the March 31, 2012 international backlog of $116.5 million.  The March 31, 2012 backlog has been restated for the sale of American Augers late in 2012.   
 
Consolidated financial information for the first quarter ended March 31, 2013 and additional information related to segment revenues and profits are attached as addenda to this press release.
 
Commenting on the announcement, Dr. J. Don Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, Although our revenues and pre-tax earnings were relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2012, we were able to improve our gross margin by 30 basis points over the first quarter of 2012 and 250 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2012.  Since the federal research and development tax credit for 2012 was not approved by Congress until early 2013, our first quarter results also include a substantial reduction in our effective tax rate.
 
Dr. Brock continued, We continue to see challenging domestic market conditions due to shortfalls in tax revenues in most states.  International business is also hampered by economic and political uncertainty in many of the markets we serve.  In spite of the lack of strong Federal highway funding and general uncertainty in the world economy, we are pleased that we have maintained our profitability and market share.  Our backlog remains strong at $276.5 million.
